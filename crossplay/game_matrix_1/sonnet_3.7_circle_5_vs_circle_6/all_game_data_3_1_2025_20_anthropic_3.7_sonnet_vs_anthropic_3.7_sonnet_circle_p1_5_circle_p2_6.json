Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 576. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 846 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 0, 5, 3, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    66 x 3 + 63 x 0 + 27 x 5 + 58 x 3 + 68 x 1\n    which is 575 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 576. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 665. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 924 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 5, 4, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    99 x 1 + 53 x 1 + 83 x 5 + 8 x 4 + 65 x 1\n    which is 664 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 665. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 3, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 2, 3, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 2, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 2, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "I need to carefully analyze this offer and determine my best course of action.\n\n## 1) Current Situation Analysis\n\n- My outside offer value: 665\n- My values per item: Item 1 (99), Item 2 (53), Item 3 (83), Item 4 (8), Item 5 (65)\n- Total pool of items: 3 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5\n- Current discount factor: \u03b3^(2-1) = 0.9 (since we're in round 2)\n- If we proceed to the next round, the discount factor will be \u03b3^(3-1) = 0.9^2 = 0.81\n\n## 2) Assessing the Current Offer\n\nPlayer 1 is offering me:\n- Item 1: 3 (all) - 0 = 3 units \u2192 3 \u00d7 99 = 297\n- Item 2: 1 (all) - 0 = 1 unit \u2192 1 \u00d7 53 = 53\n- Item 3: 6 (all) - 2 = 4 units \u2192 4 \u00d7 83 = 332\n- Item 4: 4 (all) - 1 = 3 units \u2192 3 \u00d7 8 = 24\n- Item 5: 3 (all) - 1 = 2 units \u2192 2 \u00d7 65 = 130\n\nTotal value of current offer: 297 + 53 + 332 + 24 + 130 = 836\nWith discount factor (0.9): 836 \u00d7 0.9 = 752.4\n\nThis is significantly higher than my outside offer of 665.\n\n## 3) Evaluating Possible Counteroffers\n\nWhat if I make a counteroffer? Let me consider a proposal where I keep most of my high-value items.\n\nFor example, if I offer Player 1:\n- Item 1: 0 units (keep all 3)\n- Item 2: 0 units (keep all 1)\n- Item 3: 2 units (keep 4)\n- Item 4: 3 units (keep 1)\n- Item 5: 1 unit (keep 2)\n\nMy value from this would be:\n- 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (item 1)\n- 1 \u00d7 53 = 53 (item 2)\n- 4 \u00d7 83 = 332 (item 3)\n- 1 \u00d7 8 = 8 (item 4)\n- 2 \u00d7 65 = 130 (item 5)\n\nTotal: 297 + 53 + 332 + 8 + 130 = 820\nWith discount factor (0.81 in next round): 820 \u00d7 0.81 = 664.2\n\nThis is slightly less than my outside offer, and also less than accepting the current offer.\n\n## 4) Decision Making\n\nThe current offer gives me a value of 752.4, which is:\n- Higher than my outside offer (665)\n- Likely higher than any counteroffer I could make that would be accepted in the next round (due to the discount factor)\n\nPlayer 1's new offer is actually very favorable to me - they reduced what they're asking for from the previous round. They're now only asking for 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5, which leaves me with most of the high-value items.\n\nGiven all these considerations, accepting the current offer is my best option.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 1181. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1181. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 909 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 6, 5, 3, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    87 x 3 + 27 x 6 + 95 x 5 + 41 x 3 + 53 x 3\n    which is 1180 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1181. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 1, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 1, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",

One more adjustment:\n\nLet's try [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]:\n\nMy value would be:\n- 4 units of item 1: 4 \u00d7 36 = 144\n- 6 units of item 2: 6 \u00d7 42 = 252\n- 5 units of item 3: 5 \u00d7 35 = 175\n- 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 74 = 222\n- 6 units of item 5: 6 \u00d7 58 = 348\n- Total: 1141\n\nWith discount factor: 1141 \u00d7 0.9 = 1026.9\n\nStill below my outside offer. Since we're in round 2, and accepting now would give me much less than my outside offer, it's best to WALK away.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 1, 4, 1, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    77 x 3 + 5 x 1 + 87 x 4 + 38 x 1 + 5 x 4\n    which is 642 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 643. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

My item preferences in order are:\n1. Item 3 (87 per unit)\n2. Item 1 (77 per unit)\n3. Item 4 (38 per unit)\n4. Item 2 and 5 (5 per unit each)\n\nTo make a strategic initial offer, I'll offer the other player most of the low-value items, keeping most of my high-value items:\n\nIf I offer [1, 2, 1, 4, 4] to the other player, I keep:\n- 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 77 = 308\n- 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 5 = 0\n- 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261\n- 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 38 = 38\n- 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 5 = 0\nTotal value = 607\n\nThis is below my outside offer of 643, so I need to adjust.\n\nIf I offer [1, 2, 0, 4, 4] to the other player (keeping all of item 3), I keep:\n- 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 77 = 308\n- 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 5 = 0\n- 4 units of item 3 = 4 \u00d7 87 = 348\n- 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 38 = 38\n- 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 5 = 0\nTotal value = 694\n\nThis is above my outside offer of 643 and gives me a decent margin.\n\nI could be more aggressive by offering [1, 2, 0, 5, 4] and keeping all of item 4, but I want to leave some room for negotiation. I'll go with offering [1, 2, 0, 4, 4] to start.\n\nStep 3: Make a decision\nBased on my analysis, I will make a counteroffer that gives me a value higher than my outside offer while still giving the other player something to work with. I'm offering the player most of the low-value items (to me) while keeping most of my high-value items.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 0, 4, 4]}",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 1, 4, 1, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    77 x 3 + 5 x 1 + 87 x 4 + 38 x 1 + 5 x 4\n    which is 642 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 643. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 0, 4, 4]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 2, 4, 1, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 4, 1, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

Analyzing the current situation:\n\n- My outside offer value: 981\n- My private values: \n  - Item 1: 95 per unit (2 units total)\n  - Item 2: 51 per unit (2 units total)\n  - Item 3: 18 per unit (1 unit total)\n  - Item 4: 97 per unit (4 units total)\n  - Item 5: 52 per unit (7 units total)\n- Total item pool: [2, 2, 1, 4, 7]\n- Total possible value: 2\u00d795 + 2\u00d751 + 1\u00d718 + 4\u00d797 + 7\u00d752 = 190 + 102 + 18 + 388 + 364 = 1062\n- Discount factor: \u03b3 = 0.9, meaning delaying reduces the value of outcomes\n\n## 2. Evaluating potential offers:\n\nI need to make my initial offer. Since this is the first round, I want to propose an offer that's advantageous to me while leaving some room for negotiation.\n\nLet me evaluate what happens if I keep the most valuable items:\n- I should prioritize keeping item 4 (97 value) and item 1 (95 value)\n- For my initial offer, I'll propose giving Player 2 very little\n\nIf I offer Player 2 [0, 1, 1, 0, 1], meaning I keep [2, 1, 0, 4, 6]:\nMy value = 2\u00d795 + 1\u00d751 + 0\u00d718 + 4\u00d797 + 6\u00d752 = 190 + 51 + 0 + 388 + 312 = 941\n\nThis is less than my outside offer of 981. Let me recalculate.\n\nIf I offer Player 2 [0, 0, 1, 0, 1], meaning I keep [2, 2, 0, 4, 6]:\nMy value = 2\u00d795 + 2\u00d751 + 0\u00d718 + 4\u00d797 + 6\u00d752 = 190 + 102 + 0 + 388 + 312 = 992\n\nThis exceeds my outside offer of 981, so this would be acceptable.\n\nLet me try another option:\nIf I offer Player 2 [0, 1, 1, 0, 0], meaning I keep [2, 1, 0, 4, 7]:\nMy value = 2\u00d795 + 1\u00d751 + 0\u00d718 + 4\u00d797 + 7\u00d752 = 190 + 51 + 0 + 388 + 364 = 993\n\nThis is also good, and slightly better than the previous option.\n\n## 3. Making a decision:\n\nSince it's the first round, I'll start with a strong position while avoiding Mistake 3 (offering nothing to the opponent).\n\nI'll offer Player 2 [0, 0, 1, 0, 1], which means I keep [2, 2, 0, 4, 6].\nMy value for this would be 992, which exceeds my outside offer of 981.\n\nThis is a strategic first offer as:\n- It's better than my outside offer (avoiding Mistake 2)\n- It gives some items to Player 2, but mostly lower-value ones from my perspective\n- It keeps all of the high-value item 4 units for me\n- It leaves room for negotiation in future rounds\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 0, 1]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 349. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 699 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 1, 1, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    43 x 2 + 97 x 1 + 19 x 1 + 1 x 0 + 73 x 2\n    which is 348 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 349. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 1, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 1, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 4, 3, 3, 8] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    88 x 4 + 63 x 4 + 22 x 3 + 43 x 3 + 42 x 8\n    which is 1135 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1144. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 3, 1, 2, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 3, 1, 2, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",

This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 2, 1, 0, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    90 x 4 + 40 x 2 + 56 x 1 + 41 x 0 + 30 x 3\n    which is 586 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 587. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 1, 0, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 1, 0, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Items 3 and 4 are also relatively valuable. Item 5 is my lowest value. Since Player 1 offered me most of item 1 and all of item 4, they may not value these items as highly as I do.\n\nLet me calculate a counteroffer. I'll try to keep:\n- All 4 units of item 1 (4 \u00d7 90 = 360)\n- 1 unit of item 2 (1 \u00d7 40 = 40)\n- 2 units of item 3 (2 \u00d7 56 = 112)\n- All 2 units of item 4 (2 \u00d7 41 = 82)\n- 1 unit of item 5 (1 \u00d7 30 = 30)\n\nThis gives me a total value of: 360 + 40 + 112 + 82 + 30 = 624, which exceeds my outside offer of 587.\n\nThis means I would offer to Player 1:\n- 0 units of item 1\n- 1 unit of item 2\n- 1 unit of item 3\n- 0 units of item 4\n- 3 units of item 5\n\n## 4) Decision\n\nThe current offer gives me a value of 422, which is less than my outside offer of 587.\nMy counteroffer gives me a value of 624, which exceeds my outside offer.\n\nSince the counteroffer is favorable to me and probably still acceptable to Player 1 (I'm leaving them some valuable items), I'll make this counteroffer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 1, 0, 3]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 340. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 750 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

If I make another counteroffer, even if accepted in the next round, the further discount might reduce my value.\n\nSince the current offer is better than my outside option, and we're already in round 2 with discount factors in play, accepting is the rational choice.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 7. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 885 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    64 x 0 + 17 x 0 + 60 x 0 + 61 x 0 + 93 x 0\n    which is 0 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 7. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [4, 2, 1, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [4, 2, 1, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 990. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 735 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 7, 3, 4, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    97 x 3 + 51 x 7 + 22 x 3 + 48 x 4 + 27 x 3\n    which is 987 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 990. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 222. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 930 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 2, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    50 x 0 + 60 x 0 + 21 x 2 + 82 x 1 + 97 x 1\n    which is 221 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 222. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 920. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 920. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 693 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 5, 5, 4, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    39 x 0 + 99 x 5 + 52 x 5 + 20 x 4 + 21 x 4\n    which is 919 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 920. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 4, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 2, 2, 1, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 3, 3, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 3, 3, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 690. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 885 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 4, 4, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    9 x 1 + 89 x 4 + 81 x 4 + 44 x 0 + 72 x 0\n    which is 689 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 690. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

I should keep the most valuable items for myself while offering enough to make a deal attractive.\n\nLet me consider an offer where I give minimal units of high-value items:\n- Offer to Player 2: [1, 1, 3, 0, 2]\n- I keep: [1, 4, 6, 0, 4]\n\nValue to me of what I keep:\n- 1 unit of item 1: 1 \u00d7 9 = 9\n- 4 units of item 2: 4 \u00d7 89 = 356\n- 6 units of item 3: 6 \u00d7 81 = 486\n- 0 units of item 4: 0 \u00d7 44 = 0\n- 4 units of item 5: 4 \u00d7 72 = 288\n- Total value: 1139\n\nThis is greater than my outside offer of 690, so this would be acceptable to me.\n\nLet me try another offer that gives even less to Player 2:\n- Offer to Player 2: [1, 0, 2, 0, 1]\n- I keep: [1, 5, 7, 0, 5]\n\nValue to me of what I keep:\n- 1 unit of item 1: 1 \u00d7 9 = 9\n- 5 units of item 2: 5 \u00d7 89 = 445\n- 7 units of item 3: 7 \u00d7 81 = 567\n- 0 units of item 4: 0 \u00d7 44 = 0\n- 5 units of item 5: 5 \u00d7 72 = 360\n- Total value: 1381\n\nThis is significantly better for me but might be too aggressive.\n\n## 3) Decision\n\nI want to start with a somewhat self-favoring offer, but not so extreme that Player 2 will immediately walk away. I want to leave room for negotiation.\n\nGiven that my most valuable items are 2, 3, and 5, I'll keep most of these while offering Player 2 some of each type.\n\nI'll go with:\n- Offer to Player 2: [1, 1, 3, 0, 2]\n- I keep: [1, 4, 6, 0, 4]\n\nThis gives me a value of 1139, which is well above my outside offer of 690, while giving Player 2 some of each available item type.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 3, 0, 2]}",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 2, 3, 5, 8] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    79 x 2 + 25 x 2 + 49 x 3 + 59 x 5 + 28 x 8\n    which is 874 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 875. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 2, 6, 2, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    48 x 1 + 63 x 2 + 52 x 6 + 81 x 2 + 89 x 5\n    which is 1093 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1094. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Assessing the current offer\n\nPlayer 1 is offering me [1, 0, 1, 0, 0].\nThis means I would keep [2, 2, 6, 2, 5].\n\nValue to me:\n- 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 54 = 108\n- 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 16 = 32\n- 6 units of item 3: 6 \u00d7 66 = 396\n- 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 97 = 194\n- 5 units of item 5: 5 \u00d7 12 = 60\n- Total value: 790\n\nThis is significantly better than my outside offer of 450.\n\n## 3. Considering potential counteroffers\n\nI need to maximize my value while making an offer that Player 1 might accept. Looking at their offer, they seem to value items 2, 4, and 5 more than items 1 and 3 (since they offered me units of items 1 and 3).\n\nLet me try to keep most of my high-value items (3 and 4) while offering more of the items I value less (2 and 5).\n\nPotential counteroffer [2, 1, 1, 0, 3]:\nThis would leave me with [1, 1, 6, 2, 2]\nMy value would be:\n- 1 unit of item 1: 1 \u00d7 54 = 54\n- 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 16 = 16\n- 6 units of item 3: 6 \u00d7 66 = 396\n- 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 97 = 194\n- 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 12 = 24\n- Total value: 684\n\nThis is still well above my outside offer of 450.\n\n## 4. Decision making\n\nThe current offer from Player 1 is actually quite good for me (value of 790). Making a counteroffer would risk getting a worse deal in the next round due to the discount factor.\n\nHowever, this is just the first round, and Player 1's initial offer might not be their best offer. Their offer suggests they highly value items 2, 4, and 5, which aligns with my preferences (since I highly value item 4 but not items 2 and 5).\n\nI think I can make a counteroffer that keeps what I value most while offering more of what I value less, which might appeal to Player 1.\n\nI'll keep my highest-value items (3 and 4) while offering some of the lower-value items (1, 2, and 5).

                    "response": "I need to analyze this offer carefully and decide my next move.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the current situation\n\n- My outside offer value: 1094\n- My item values: \n  - Item 1: 48 per unit (3 units total)\n  - Item 2: 63 per unit (2 units total)\n  - Item 3: 52 per unit (7 units total)\n  - Item 4: 81 per unit (2 units total)\n  - Item 5: 89 per unit (5 units total)\n- Total pool: [3, 2, 7, 2, 5]\n- Discount factor: 0.9 (we're in round 2, so any deal would be worth 0.9 of its face value)\n\n### Step 2: Assess the value of the current offer\n\nPlayer 2 has offered me [2, 1, 1, 0, 3], meaning I keep [1, 1, 6, 2, 2].\n\nLet me calculate the value of this offer to me:\n- 1 unit of item 1: 1 \u00d7 48 = 48\n- 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 63 = 63\n- 6 units of item 3: 6 \u00d7 52 = 312\n- 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 81 = 162\n- 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 89 = 178\n\nTotal value = 48 + 63 + 312 + 162 + 178 = 763\n\nAdjusted for round 2 discount: 763 \u00d7 0.9 = 686.7\n\nThis is significantly less than my outside offer of 1094, so accepting would be a mistake.\n\n### Step 3: Consider a counteroffer\n\nI need to propose a division that gives me at least my outside offer value of 1094 (before discount).\n\nLet me try keeping:\n- 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 48 = 144\n- 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 63 = 126\n- 6 units of item 3: 6 \u00d7 52 = 312\n- 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 81 = 162\n- 4 units of item 5: 4 \u00d7 89 = 356\n\nTotal: 144 + 126 + 312 + 162 + 356 = 1100\n\nThis gives me a value of 1100, which is above my outside offer of 1094. After the round 2 discount, this would be 1100 \u00d7 0.9 = 990.\n\nSo my counteroffer would be to give Player 2:\n[0, 0, 1, 0, 1]\n\nMeaning I keep [3, 2, 6, 2, 4] and give them just 1 unit of item 3 and 1 unit of item 5.\n\nThis is a reasonable offer since it's above my outside offer value, but not too greedy (I'm still offering them some items).\n\n### Step 4: Make a decision\n\nI won't accept the current offer since its value (686.7) is below my outside offer (1094).\nI won't walk away yet since there's potential for a better deal.\nI'll make a counteroffer that ensures I get at least my outside offer value.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 0, 1]}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 6, 0, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    54 x 0 + 16 x 1 + 66 x 6 + 97 x 0 + 12 x 3\n    which is 448 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 450. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 6, 5, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    92 x 0 + 71 x 3 + 13 x 6 + 15 x 5 + 49 x 2\n    which is 464 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 465. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 5, 4, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 5, 4, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1118. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 771 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [8, 0, 3, 2, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    76 x 8 + 7 x 0 + 52 x 3 + 87 x 2 + 35 x 5\n    which is 1113 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1118. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [4, 2, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [4, 2, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 602. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 621 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 4, 2, 1, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    5 x 5 + 87 x 4 + 38 x 2 + 52 x 1 + 25 x 4\n    which is 601 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 602. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "I need to analyze this negotiation situation carefully to maximize my value.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the current situation\n\n- My outside offer value is 602\n- My item values:\n  - Item 1: 5 per unit (5 units available)\n  - Item 2: 87 per unit (4 units available)\n  - Item 3: 38 per unit (5 units available)\n  - Item 4: 52 per unit (1 unit available)\n  - Item 5: 25 per unit (4 units available)\n- Total value of all items: 715\n- Current round: 1 (discount factor doesn't apply yet)\n\n### Step 2: Calculate optimal allocation\n\nLet me calculate the total value of all items to understand what I'm working with:\n- Item 1: 5 \u00d7 5 = 25\n- Item 2: 87 \u00d7 4 = 348\n- Item 3: 38 \u00d7 5 = 190\n- Item 4: 52 \u00d7 1 = 52\n- Item 5: 25 \u00d7 4 = 100\n- Total: 715\n\nSince I need to exceed my outside offer of 602, I need to keep items worth at least 603. If I want to make a fair offer that maximizes my chances of acceptance, I should:\n\n1. Keep high-value items for myself (especially item 2)\n2. Offer lower-value items to Player 2\n3. Ensure my kept items exceed 603 in value\n\nLet me design an offer where I keep most of item 2 and other high-value items:\n\nIf I offer:\n- Item 1: 5 units (all) to Player 2 = 5 \u00d7 5 = 25 value lost\n- Item 2: 0 units to Player 2 = 0 value lost\n- Item 3: 2 units to Player 2 = 2 \u00d7 38 = 76 value lost\n- Item 4: 0 units to Player 2 = 0 value lost\n- Item 5: 2 units to Player 2 = 2 \u00d7 25 = 50 value lost\n\nTotal value lost: 151\nValue I keep: 715 - 151 = 564\n\nBut this is less than my outside offer. Let me adjust:\n\nIf I offer:\n- Item 1: 5 units (all) to Player 2 = 25 value lost\n- Item 2: 0 units to Player 2 = 0 value lost\n- Item 3: 1 unit to Player 2 = 38 value lost\n- Item 4: 0 units to Player 2 = 0 value lost\n- Item 5: 2 units to Player 2 = 50 value lost\n\nTotal value lost: 113\nValue I keep: 715 - 113 = 602\n\nThis exactly matches my outside offer, but I should aim for better. Let me try:\n\nIf I offer:\n- Item 1: 5 units (all) to Player 2 = 25 value lost\n- Item 2: 0 units to Player 2 = 0 value lost\n- Item 3: 0 units to Player 2 = 0 value lost\n- Item 4: 0 units to Player 2 = 0 value lost\n- Item 5: 1 unit to Player 2 = 25 value lost\n\nTotal value lost: 50\nValue I keep: 715 - 50 = 665 (much better than my outside offer)\n\n### Step 3: Make a decision\n\nMy optimal strategy is to offer Player 2 all of item 1 (which is low value to me) and 1 unit of item 5, while keeping all of items 2, 3, and 4 (which are higher value to me).\n\nThis gives me a value of 665, which is significantly better than my outside offer of 602. The counteroffer seems reasonable as I'm giving Player 2 some items but prioritizing keeping those most valuable to me.\n\nMy initial offer to Player 2 will be [5, 0, 0, 0, 1] - meaning I give them all 5 units of item 1, no units of items 2-4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [5, 0, 0, 0, 1]}",

Since item 2 is my highest value item (87 per unit), I definitely want to keep most or all of it. Let me see what happens if I keep all of items 2, 3, and 4, and most of item 5:\n   \n   If I offer [4, 0, 0, 0, 1] to Player 2, I would keep:\n   - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 5 = 5\n   - 4 units of item 2 = 4 \u00d7 87 = 348\n   - 5 units of item 3 = 5 \u00d7 38 = 190\n   - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 52 = 52\n   - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75\n   \n   Total value for me = 670\n   Discounted value = 670 \u00d7 0.9 = 603\n   \n   This is just above my outside offer of 602.\n\n4) Decision:\n   The current offer from Player 2 is worth much less than my outside offer (85.5 vs 602).\n   \n   My potential counteroffer of [4, 0, 0, 0, 1] would give me a discounted value of 603, which is slightly better than my outside offer.\n   \n   Since we're already in round 2, I need to be careful about the discount factor. If I make a counteroffer now and it gets rejected, we'd move to round 3 with a discount of 0.9\u00b2 = 0.81.\n   \n   My best action is to make a counteroffer that gives me enough value while having a chance of being accepted.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 0, 0, 0, 1]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 673. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 720 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 4, 4, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    49 x 0 + 77 x 4 + 87 x 4 + 19 x 0 + 8 x 2\n    which is 672 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 673. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [5, 0, 0, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [4, 0, 0, 0, 3]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [4, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [4, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 438. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 438. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 957 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 3, 3, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    92 x 0 + 90 x 1 + 69 x 3 + 36 x 3 + 32 x 1\n    which is 437 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 438. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 0, 3, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 2, 4, 3]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 1, 3, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 3, 1, 3, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "I need to carefully analyze this negotiation to maximize my value while avoiding the five key mistakes.\n\n## Step 1: Analyze the current situation\n\n- My outside offer value: 438\n- My item values: 92 for item 1, 90 for item 2, 69 for item 3, 36 for item 4, 32 for item 5\n- Total items: 1 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 7 of item 4, 4 of item 5\n- Discount factor: 0.9 (current round is 2, so discount is 0.9^1 = 0.9)\n- Current offer to me: [1, 3, 1, 3, 1] from Player 1\n\n## Step 2: Assess the value of offers\n\n### Value of current offer from Player 1:\n- 1 unit of item 1: 1 \u00d7 92 = 92\n- 3 units of item 2: 3 \u00d7 90 = 270\n- 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 69 = 69\n- 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 36 = 108\n- 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 32 = 32\n- Total value: 571\n- Discounted value (round 2): 571 \u00d7 0.9 = 513.9\n\nSo accepting this offer would give me a value of 513.9, which is better than my outside offer of 438.\n\n### Analysis of Player 1's behavior:\n- First offer: [1, 3, 0, 3, 1] - Player 1 wanted to keep all of item 3\n- Second offer: [1, 3, 1, 3, 1] - Player 1 is now willing to give me 1 unit of item 3\n\nThis suggests Player 1 values item 3 but might be willing to compromise.\n\n## Step 3: Consider potential counteroffers\n\nLooking at my previous counteroffer [0, 1, 2, 4, 3], I kept:\n- 1 unit of item 1: 1 \u00d7 92 = 92\n- 3 units of item 2: 3 \u00d7 90 = 270\n- 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 69 = 138\n- 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 36 = 108\n- 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 32 = 32\n- Total: 640 (before discount)\n\nLet me consider a new counteroffer that improves our negotiation position:\n- I could offer [0, 1, 1, 4, 3], keeping [1, 3, 3, 3, 1]\n  - Value: 92 + 270 + 207 + 108 + 32 = 709\n  - Discounted value: 709 \u00d7 0.9 = 638.1\n\n## Step 4: Make a decision\n\nThe current offer from Player 1 gives me a value of 513.9, which is better than my outside offer of 438. However, I could potentially get more value with a counteroffer.\n\nSince we're in round 2 and there's only one more round after this, I need to be careful. If I make a counteroffer now and Player 1 rejects it in round 3, I'd only get my outside offer of 438, which is less than accepting the current offer (513.9).\n\nHowever, the potential gain from a successful counteroffer (638.1) is significant. Since Player 1 has already shown willingness to compromise, I'll make one more reasonable counteroffer that gives them more of item 4 (which I value less) while keeping more of items 1-3 (which I value more).\n\nI'll make a counteroffer of [0, 1, 1, 4, 3], which means I keep [1, 3, 3, 3, 1].\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 1, 4, 3]}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 496. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 597 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 4, 3, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    8 x 0 + 49 x 4 + 9 x 3 + 77 x 2 + 56 x 2\n    which is 489 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 496. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 4, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    42 x 0 + 55 x 0 + 64 x 1 + 17 x 4 + 8 x 2\n    which is 148 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 149. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 2, 0, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This suggests:\n- They might value item 3 less than I do\n- They likely value items 2, 4, and 5 more highly\n- They're willing to keep most of item 1, suggesting they might value it\n\n## Step 4: Formulate a counteroffer\n\nGiven these insights and my values, I should keep the items I value most (items 2, 4, and 5) and offer some of the lower-value items.\n\nLet me consider offering [3, 0, 1, 0, 0]:\n- This means I keep [1, 3, 2, 1, 1]\n- Value to me: (1\u00d76) + (3\u00d795) + (2\u00d779) + (1\u00d784) + (1\u00d791) = 6 + 285 + 158 + 84 + 91 = 624\n\nThis is significantly better than my outside offer of 378 and better than accepting the current offer (478).\n\nAnother option could be [3, 0, 2, 0, 0]:\n- This means I keep [1, 3, 1, 1, 1]\n- Value to me: (1\u00d76) + (3\u00d795) + (1\u00d779) + (1\u00d784) + (1\u00d791) = 6 + 285 + 79 + 84 + 91 = 545\n\nThis is also better than my outside offer and the current offer, but not as good as the previous counteroffer.\n\nI'll go with the first counteroffer [3, 0, 1, 0, 0] as it maximizes my value while still being potentially attractive to Player 1 based on their revealed preferences.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 0, 1, 0, 0]}",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 120. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 276 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 2, 2, 3, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    66 x 1 + 11 x 2 + 4 x 2 + 1 x 3 + 10 x 2\n    which is 119 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 120. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 3, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 3, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

From Player 1's offer, I can see they may value item 3 and possibly item 2, since they only offered me some of these items. They kept all of item 5, which suggests they value it.\n\nLet me craft a counteroffer:\n- I'll keep 4 units of item 1 (high value to me)\n- I'll give 3 units of item 2 (keeping 1)\n- I'll give 3 units of item 3 (keeping 1)\n- I'll give 4 units of item 4 (keeping 1)\n- I'll give 1 unit of item 5 (keeping 1)\n\nSo my offer to Player 1 is [1, 3, 3, 4, 1]\n\nLet me calculate my value if this offer is accepted:\n- 4 units of item 1: 4 \u00d7 66 = 264\n- 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 11 = 11\n- 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 4 = 4\n- 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 1 = 1\n- 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 10 = 10\nTotal value = 290\n\nThis is significantly better than my outside offer of 120, so this offer makes sense.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 3, 3, 4, 1]}",

                    "response": "I need to analyze the current situation to make the best decision for maximizing my value.\n\n1) Current situation analysis:\n   - My outside offer value: 120\n   - My item values: 66 (item 1), 11 (item 2), 4 (item 3), 1 (item 4), 10 (item 5)\n   - Total pool: 5 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5\n   - Discount factor: 0.9 (We're in round 2, so any deal will be multiplied by 0.9)\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n\n   Current offer to me: [4, 2, 2, 3, 1] (remaining items after Player 1's offer of [1, 2, 2, 2, 1])\n   Value calculation:\n   - 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 66 = 264\n   - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 11 = 22\n   - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 4 = 8\n   - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3\n   - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 10 = 10\n   Total value = 307\n   Discounted value (round 2) = 307 \u00d7 0.9 = 276.3\n\n   This is significantly higher than my outside offer of 120.\n\n3) Decision making:\n   Since the current offer gives me a value (276.3) more than double my outside offer (120), it's a good deal for me. I should consider accepting it.\n\n   Let's also consider a potential counteroffer. I should focus on getting more of the high-value item 1 while giving up more of the low-value items 3 and 4:\n\n   Potential counteroffer to Player 1: [1, 2, 3, 4, 1]\n   This would leave me with: [4, 2, 1, 1, 1]\n   Value to me:\n   - 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 66 = 264\n   - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 11 = 22\n   - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 4 = 4\n   - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 1 = 1\n   - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 10 = 10\n   Total value = 301\n   Discounted value (round 2) = 301 \u00d7 0.9 = 270.9\n\n   This counteroffer would actually give me slightly less value than accepting the current offer. Also, if I make a counteroffer, we'll move to round 3 and face further discounting.\n\nGiven that:\n1. The current offer gives me a very good value (276.3)\n2. It's substantially better than my outside offer (120)\n3. We're already in round 2, so further negotiation would lead to additional discounting\n4. My potential counteroffer doesn't improve my position\n\nThe optimal decision is to accept the current offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",
