                    "prompt": "\n    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\n    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\n    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\n    There are 2 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\n    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\n    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 101.\n    Your private values are 38 for item 1, 23 for item 2, 15 for item 3, 30 for item 4, 20 for item 5.\n    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to your total value of all items, which is 348. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 326. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 326. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 378 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 3, 2, 3, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    38 x 2 + 23 x 3 + 15 x 2 + 30 x 3 + 20 x 3\n    which is 325 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 326. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

This means that deals in later rounds are worth less to me.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - Current offer: There is no current offer.\n   - Potential counteroffers: I need to consider different divisions and calculate their value to me.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince there is no offer on the table, I need to make an initial offer. I want to make an offer that is likely to be accepted but still gives me a good value. To do this, I need to think about what Player 2's values might be. Because their values are drawn uniformly from 1 to 101, it is likely that they have similar values to me. I will start by offering roughly half of the total value of the items. The total value of the items is 348.

I can offer close to everything but even that is not enough to beat the outside offer after the discount.\n\nConsidering the current round (round 2) and the discount factor, my best option is to walk away and secure my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 730. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 730. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 864 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 0, 3, 3, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    63 x 3 + 46 x 0 + 87 x 3 + 5 x 3 + 87 x 3\n    which is 726 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 730. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 0, 3, 3, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    63 x 3 + 46 x 0 + 87 x 3 + 5 x 3 + 87 x 3\n    which is 726 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 730. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 1, 1, 2, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [3, 0, 0, 2, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 0, 0, 2, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's start by analyzing the current situation.\n\n1) Analysis of the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 950.\n   - My values for the items are: item 1 = 30, item 2 = 19, item 3 = 76, item 4 = 67, item 5 = 71.\n   - The total pool of items is: 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor is 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its face value, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 0.9^2 = 0.81 times its face value.  This incentivizes me to reach a deal sooner rather than later, but I also want to avoid accepting a bad deal early.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - There is no current offer on the table.\n   - I need to construct a counteroffer that is better than my outside option, and also potentially attractive to the other player.\n   - An offer that yields me less than 950 is unacceptable.\n\n3) Making a decision:\n   - I need to create an initial offer. I want to retain a combination of items whose value exceeds 950.\n\nLet's try keeping 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5, as these are my highest value items. Then I'll give all units of items 1 and 2.\nMy value would be:\n3 * 76 + 3 * 67 + 3 * 71 = 228 + 201 + 213 = 642\n\nThis isn't good enough, as it falls far short of my outside offer.\n\nLet's start by offering 2 units of items 1, 2, 4 and 5, and 1 unit of item 3.\nThis means I keep 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5.\nMy value would be:\n2 * 30 + 2 * 19 + 2 * 76 + 2 * 67 + 2 * 71 = 60 + 38 + 152 + 134 + 142 = 526\n\nThis is worse than my previous estimation.\n\nLet's calculate the value of keeping 3 of each item.\n3 * 30 + 3 * 19 + 3 * 76 + 3 * 67 + 3 * 71 = 90 + 57 + 228 + 201 + 213 = 789. Still less than the outside offer.\n\nLet me try offering the other player only 1 unit of item 1, item 2, item 4 and item 5, and no units of item 3.\nThis means I keep 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5.\nMy value would be:\n3 * 30 + 3 * 19 + 3 * 76 + 3 * 67 + 3 * 71 = 90 + 57 + 228 + 201 + 213 = 789.

I will need to keep more to ensure my value is greater than 950.\n\nKeep everything but 1 of each item:\n3 * 30 + 3 * 19 + 2 * 76 + 3 * 67 + 3 * 71 = 90 + 57 + 152 + 201 + 213 = 713\n\nI am going to offer [1, 1, 0, 1, 1] to the other player. This leaves me with 3 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 3 of item 4 and 3 of item 5.\nThis values to 789, as calculated before.\n\nTo get above 950 I will need to reduce my offer:\nIf I offer [0,0,0,0,0]:\n30 * 4 + 19 * 4 + 76 * 3 + 67 * 4 + 71 * 4 = 120 + 76 + 228 + 268 + 284 = 976\n\nOk, that is my total value. If I want above my outside offer I need to keep most things.\nLets offer: [1,1,1,1,1]\nThen my value is:\n30 * 3 + 19 * 3 + 76 * 2 + 67 * 3 + 71 * 3 = 90 + 57 + 152 + 201 + 213 = 713.\n\nI need to keep more!\n\nLet's offer [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n4*30 + 4*19 + 2*76 + 4*67 + 4*71 = 120 + 76 + 152 + 268 + 284 = 900.\n\nVery close.\n\nIf I offer [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n4*30 + 4*19 + 3*76 + 3*67 + 4*71 = 120 + 76 + 228 + 201 + 284 = 909\n\nIf I offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n4*30 + 4*19 + 3*76 + 4*67 + 3*71 = 120 + 76 + 228 + 268 + 213 = 905.\n\nI will make my first offer: offer only one unit of item 3.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 4, 3, 4, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    30 x 3 + 19 x 4 + 76 x 3 + 67 x 4 + 71 x 4\n    which is 946 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 950. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 128. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 846 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 2, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    52 x 0 + 70 x 0 + 56 x 2 + 89 x 0 + 15 x 1\n    which is 127 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 128. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's start by analyzing the current situation.\n\n1) **Current Situation:**\n   - My outside offer value: 128\n   - Item values: Item 1: 52, Item 2: 70, Item 3: 56, Item 4: 89, Item 5: 15\n   - Total items: Item 1: 5, Item 2: 2, Item 3: 5, Item 4: 8, Item 5: 7\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.9.  This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its face value, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 0.9^2 = 0.81 times its face value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer: None. I need to make an initial offer.\n   - Potential counteroffers:  I want to make an offer that is better than my outside option, but also gives the other player enough to accept. It's round 1, so a reasonable approach is to aim for a roughly even split of the total value, while being mindful of my higher values on Item 2 and Item 4, and my lower value on Item 5.\n\nLet's try an initial offer where I give Player 2 half of each item where possible, rounded to nearest whole number.\n- Item 1: 5/2 = 2.5, offer 2.\n- Item 2: 2/2 = 1, offer 1.\n- Item 3: 5/2 = 2.5, offer 2.\n- Item 4: 8/2 = 4, offer 4.\n- Item 5: 7/2 = 3.5, offer 3.\n\nThis would leave me with:\n- Item 1: 3 units = 3 * 52 = 156\n- Item 2: 1 unit = 1 * 70 = 70\n- Item 3: 3 units = 3 * 56 = 168\n- Item 4: 4 units = 4 * 89 = 356\n- Item 5: 4 units = 4 * 15 = 60\nTotal value to me: 156 + 70 + 168 + 356 + 60 = 810\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\nSince 810 > 128, this initial offer is better than my outside offer. It also seems likely to be better than an offer giving away all the items, offering nothing or walking away.

Therefore, walking away would be a mistake.\n\n3. **Consider Counteroffers:**\n\nTo find a good counteroffer, it is beneficial to look at what is left over from the offer they gave us, and then think if we can take some items and give them an offer that is fair and gets us more value in the end than what they are offering us now, while still being better than them just walking away as well. \n\nCurrently we are offered [2, 0, 4, 5, 2] which means we are giving them [3, 2, 1, 3, 5]\nWe can start with seeing how much they value that offer. I don't know their values, but I know my values, so in the case of making a counteroffer, it might be more profitable to walk.\n\n4. **Decision:**\n\nSince the current offer is worth 722.7 to me, which is substantially higher than my outside offer of 128, I should accept the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 275. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 275. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 861 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 1, 0, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    97 x 2 + 50 x 1 + 90 x 0 + 30 x 1 + 20 x 0\n    which is 274 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 275. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 275\n*   **My values per item:** Item 1: 97, Item 2: 50, Item 3: 90, Item 4: 30, Item 5: 20\n*   **Total pool of items:** Item 1: 3, Item 2: 4, Item 3: 4, Item 4: 1, Item 5: 2\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that offers in later rounds are worth less to both players.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find an offer that gives me a value greater than my outside offer. I want to offer as little as possible to Player 2 while still making a deal likely.\n\nLet's try a few potential counteroffers, keeping in mind I want to maximize my value:\n\n*   **Offer 1:** Offer Player 2 [1, 1, 1, 0, 0].\n    *   This means I keep [2, 3, 3, 1, 2]\n    *   My value: (2 * 97) + (3 * 50) + (3 * 90) + (1 * 30) + (2 * 20) = 194 + 150 + 270 + 30 + 40 = 684\n    *   This is significantly better than my outside offer.\n\n*   **Offer 2:** Offer Player 2 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n    *   This means I keep [3, 4, 4, 1, 2]\n    *   My value: (3 * 97) + (4 * 50) + (4 * 90) + (1 * 30) + (2 * 20) = 291 + 200 + 360 + 30 + 40 = 921\n    *   This would give me my maximum possible value, but is likely to be rejected.\n\n*   **Offer 3:** Offer Player 2 [1, 2, 2, 0, 1]\n    *   This means I keep [2, 2, 2, 1, 1]\n    *   My value: (2 * 97) + (2 * 50) + (2 * 90) + (1 * 30) + (1 * 20) = 194 + 100 + 180 + 30 + 20 = 524\n    *   This is significantly better than my outside offer.\n\n*   **Offer 4:** Offer Player 2 [2, 3, 3, 1, 2]\n     * This means I keep [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]\n     * My value: (1 * 97) + (1 * 50) + (1 * 90) + (0 * 30) + (0 * 20) = 97 + 50 + 90 + 0 + 0 = 237\n     * This is worse than my outside offer, so this would be mistake #2.\n        \n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nI want to make an offer that is good for me, but also has a chance of being accepted.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 1, 0, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    97 x 2 + 50 x 1 + 90 x 0 + 30 x 1 + 20 x 0\n    which is 274 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 275. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 4, 2, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    67 x 0 + 6 x 1 + 42 x 4 + 11 x 2 + 26 x 0\n    which is 196 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 197. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 2, 1, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 1, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 1, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best course of action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 197\n*   **Values of the items:** Item 1: 67, Item 2: 6, Item 3: 42, Item 4: 11, Item 5: 26\n*   **Total pool of items:** Item 1: 0, Item 2: 2, Item 3: 5, Item 4: 2, Item 5: 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means accepting an offer in round 2 gives me 0.9 * value, and accepting in round 3 gives me 0.9^2 * value. It incentivizes making a deal sooner rather than later.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [0, 1, 1, 2, 1]. This means I would receive:\n    *   0 units of item 1: 0 * 67 = 0\n    *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 6 = 6\n    *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 42 = 42\n    *   2 units of item 4: 2 * 11 = 22\n    *   1 unit of item 5: 1 * 26 = 26\n    *   Total value of current offer = 0 + 6 + 42 + 22 + 26 = 96\n    *   Since this is round 2, the discounted value = 96 * 0.9 = 86.4\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (86.4) is significantly less than my outside offer (197). Therefore, accepting this offer would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to determine if a counteroffer can yield a higher value than my outside offer, taking into account the discount factor.  I also need to consider what Player 2 offered previously. Player 2's initial offer suggested they value Items 2, 3, 4, and 5 to some extent. Player 2 offered me [0, 1, 1, 2, 1], meaning they kept [0, 1, 4, 0, 4].\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I keep [0, 1, 3, 1, 3] and offer the rest to Player 2.\n    *   0 units of item 1: 0 * 67 = 0\n    *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 6 = 6\n    *   3 unit of item 3: 3 * 42 = 126\n    *   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 11 = 11\n    *   3 unit of item 5: 3 * 26 = 78\n    *   Total value to me = 0 + 6 + 126 + 11 + 78 = 221\n    *   Discounted value = 221 * 0.9 = 198.9 which is higher than my outside offer of 197.\n\nSo, let's make that counteroffer. It offers Player 2 [0, 1, 2, 1, 2].\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nI will make a counteroffer of [0, 1, 2, 1, 2].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 2, 1, 2]}\n```",

This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [6, 3, 4, 2, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    74 x 6 + 23 x 3 + 38 x 4 + 34 x 2 + 12 x 3\n    which is 769 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 770. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step to determine the best course of action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** 770\n*   **Item values:** Item 1: 74, Item 2: 23, Item 3: 38, Item 4: 34, Item 5: 12\n*   **Total items:** Item 1: 6, Item 2: 5, Item 3: 5, Item 4: 2, Item 5: 4\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that offers in later rounds are worth less than offers in earlier rounds.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Since I'm Player 1 and it's the first round, I need to propose an initial offer (what I give to Player 2). I want to maximize my value while also making the offer attractive enough for Player 2 to consider. I need to keep in mind my outside option.\n\nLet's start by constructing a potentially good offer, and then evaluate it. I will aim for a division that gives me more than my outside offer value of 770. Let's try giving Player 2 half of item 1 and item 2, and one of item 3, item 4, and item 5. \n\nOffer to Player 2: [3, 2, 1, 1, 1]\n\nThis leaves me with: [3, 3, 4, 1, 3]\n\nMy value would be:\n\n3 * 74 + 3 * 23 + 4 * 38 + 1 * 34 + 3 * 12 = 222 + 69 + 152 + 34 + 36 = 513\n\nThis is way below my outside offer value. I need to make sure that the amount I give to Player 2 will still leave me with a value better than 770. Let's iterate to make my offer better.\n\nTry offering [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]\n\nThis leaves me with [5, 4, 4, 2, 4]\n\nMy value is 5 * 74 + 4 * 23 + 4 * 38 + 2 * 34 + 4 * 12 = 370 + 92 + 152 + 68 + 48 = 730\n\nThis is still less than 770.\n\nHow about offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]? \nThis gives me 6 * 74 + 5 * 23 + 5 * 38 + 2 * 34 + 4 * 12 = 444 + 115 + 190 + 68 + 48 = 865\n\nOkay, let's try offering 1 unit of item 5, since it has the lowest value for me.\n\nOffer [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\nThis gives me 6 * 74 + 5 * 23 + 5 * 38 + 2 * 34 + 3 * 12 = 444 + 115 + 190 + 68 + 36 = 853\n\nStill way above my outside offer. Let's try offering 1 of item 4.\n\nOffer [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]\nThis gives me 6 * 74 + 5 * 23 + 5 * 38 + 1 * 34 + 3 * 12 = 444 + 115 + 190 + 34 + 36 = 819\n\nStill above 770. How about offering them 1 of item 3 as well?\n\nOffer [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]\nThis gives me 6 * 74 + 5 * 23 + 4 * 38 + 1 * 34 + 3 * 12 = 444 + 115 + 152 + 34 + 36 = 781\n\nOk, this is closer to 770. Let's offer 1 of item 2 as well.\n\nOffer [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nThis gives me 6 * 74 + 4 * 23 + 4 * 38 + 1 * 34 + 3 * 12 = 444 + 92 + 152 + 34 + 36 = 758\n\nThat's too low! So, I should not offer 1 of item 2, and instead offer [0,0,1,1,1].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items.

For instance, suppose you keep only [6, 3, 4, 2, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party.

This means that accepting an offer in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its actual value, and in round 3 it is worth 0.81 times its actual value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [3, 3, 3, 0, 1]. This means I would receive:\n    *   3 units of item 1: 3 * 74 = 222\n    *   3 units of item 2: 3 * 23 = 69\n    *   3 units of item 3: 3 * 38 = 114\n    *   0 units of item 4: 0 * 34 = 0\n    *   1 unit of item 5: 1 * 12 = 12\n    *   Total value: 222 + 69 + 114 + 0 + 12 = 417\n    *   Discounted value: 417 * 0.9 = 375.3\n\n*   **Outside offer vs. Current offer:** The current offer, even with the discount, is worth 375.3 to me. This is significantly lower than my outside offer of 770.\n\n*   **Counteroffers:** I need to propose an offer that I would be happy with. To avoid mistake 2 (making an offer worse than my outside offer), I need to keep enough items so that their total value is greater than or equal to 770. Let's start by calculating the total value of all items:\n    *   6 * 74 + 5 * 23 + 5 * 38 + 2 * 34 + 4 * 12 = 444 + 115 + 190 + 68 + 48 = 865.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\nSince the current offer is significantly worse than my outside offer, I will not accept it. I will also not walk away immediately, because there is still one round left. I need to craft a counteroffer. I want to keep as much value as possible, but also make an offer that Player 2 might accept. Given my outside offer is 770, I need to secure that much value for myself.\nLet's start by ensuring I get close to my desired value:\nKeep [6, 5, 5, 2, 4]: Value = 865. Now, I need to offer Player 2 [0,0,0,0,0], but this is Mistake 3: Offering no items at all.\nLet's explore keeping one less unit of item 1 (since it has the highest value).\nKeep [5, 5, 5, 2, 4]: Value = 74*5 + 23*5 + 38*5 + 34*2 + 12*4 = 370 + 115 + 190 + 68 + 48 = 791 > 770.

I want to keep high-value items (especially item 5) while offering enough to make Player 1 stay in the negotiation.\n\nSince Player 1 initially offered me very little and now is only offering me 1 unit of item 1, they seem to value item 1 highly. Their latest offer gives me only 1 unit of item 1 and keeps everything else, suggesting they value all items.\n\nI'll try a more balanced offer that keeps my highest value items while giving Player 1 more of item 1:\n- Give Player 1: [4 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5]\n- Keep for myself: [2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5]\n\nMy value from this counteroffer:\n- Item 1: 2 \u00d7 44 = 88\n- Item 2: 3 \u00d7 27 = 81\n- Item 3: 3 \u00d7 34 = 102\n- Item 4: 2 \u00d7 69 = 138\n- Item 5: 3 \u00d7 94 = 282\nTotal: 691 \u00d7 0.9 = 621.9\n\nWhile this is less than my outside offer (716), we're in round 2 and a counteroffer might lead to a better deal in round 3.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 770. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 543 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [6, 3, 4, 2, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    74 x 6 + 23 x 3 + 38 x 4 + 34 x 2 + 12 x 3\n    which is 769 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 770. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 3, 3, 0, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [4, 2, 2, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [4, 2, 2, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n1) **Current Situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 770\n*   Item values: item 1 = 74, item 2 = 23, item 3 = 38, item 4 = 34, item 5 = 12\n*   Total items: item 1 = 6, item 2 = 5, item 3 = 5, item 4 = 2, item 5 = 4\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means any deal in round 3 is worth 0.9^(3-1) = 0.81 times the value of the items.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** I am being offered [4, 2, 2, 0, 1].

Let's aim for a value of at least 770/0.81 = 950.61 raw value before discounting. This makes calculations somewhat complicated, so let's start by trying to take all item 1.\n    * I keep: [6, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Then Player 2 gets [0, 5, 5, 2, 4].\n    * Value of my share: (6*74) = 444\n    * Discounted value: 444 * 0.81 = 359.64\n    * Not high enough.\n    * Let's try to get all of items 1, 2, and 3.\n    * I keep: [6, 5, 5, 0, 0] and give Player 2 [0, 0, 0, 2, 4]\n    * Value of my share: (6*74)+(5*23)+(5*38) = 444 + 115 + 190 = 749\n    * Not high enough.\n\n    * It seems unlikely I can reach my outside offer by only offering integers, as the discount factor is significant. Given that this is the last round, I need to either accept the current offer or walk away.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\n*   The current offer's discounted value (352.35) is much lower than my outside offer (770).\n*   Since it is the last round, any counteroffer I make will be treated as a walk.\n\nTherefore, I should walk away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

The discount factor means that offers in later rounds are worth less. This encourages reaching an agreement sooner rather than later.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** None.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Since I am Player 1 and it is the first round, I have to make an offer. I need to consider what to offer to Player 2 to maximize my own value while also making it attractive enough for Player 2 to accept. I want my offer to be better than my outside option.\n\nLet's try calculating the value of keeping half of the items for myself:\n*   Item 1: Keep 2, offer 3 -> 2 * 24 = 48\n*   Item 2: Keep 2, offer 2 -> 2 * 94 = 188\n*   Item 3: Keep 2, offer 3 -> 2 * 80 = 160\n*   Item 4: Keep 1, offer 2 -> 1 * 13 = 13\n*   Item 5: Keep 2, offer 3 -> 2 * 63 = 126\n\nTotal value = 48 + 188 + 160 + 13 + 126 = 535.  This is much lower than my outside offer.\n\nLet's try a counteroffer that gives Player 2 a significant amount. How about offering the following:\n*   Item 1: 2 units (keep 3)  -> 3 * 24 = 72\n*   Item 2: 1 unit (keep 3)  -> 3 * 94 = 282\n*   Item 3: 2 units (keep 3)  -> 3 * 80 = 240\n*   Item 4: 1 unit (keep 2)  -> 2 * 13 = 26\n*   Item 5: 2 units (keep 3)  -> 3 * 63 = 189\n\nTotal value = 72 + 282 + 240 + 26 + 189 = 809. Still lower than the outside offer.\n\nLet's try offering fewer items:\n*   Item 1: 1 unit (keep 4)  -> 4 * 24 = 96\n*   Item 2: 0 unit (keep 4)  -> 4 * 94 = 376\n*   Item 3: 1 unit (keep 4)  -> 4 * 80 = 320\n*   Item 4: 0 unit (keep 3)  -> 3 * 13 = 39\n*   Item 5: 1 unit (keep 4)  -> 4 * 63 = 252\n\nTotal value = 96 + 376 + 320 + 39 + 252 = 1083. Getting closer.\n\nLet's offer even less, aiming for just above my outside offer.\n*   Item 1: 0 unit (keep 5)  -> 5 * 24 = 120\n*   Item 2: 0 unit (keep 4)  -> 4 * 94 = 376\n*   Item 3: 0 unit (keep 5)  -> 5 * 80 = 400\n*   Item 4: 0 unit (keep 3)  -> 3 * 13 = 39\n*   Item 5: 0 unit (keep 5)  -> 5 * 63 = 315\n\nTotal value = 120 + 376 + 400 + 39 + 315 = 1250.\n\nSince I have a high outside offer, and the discount factor favors reaching an agreement sooner, I will make an offer that keeps all the items for myself. This way, even with a discount, it will still be more than my outside option.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   I will propose a counteroffer that keeps all the items for myself.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 4, 5, 2, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    24 x 5 + 94 x 4 + 80 x 5 + 13 x 2 + 63 x 3\n    which is 1111 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1113. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 1, 5, 0, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 5, 0, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 1113.\n   - My item values are: item 1 = 24, item 2 = 94, item 3 = 80, item 4 = 13, item 5 = 63.\n   - Total item pool: 5 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5.\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.9.  This means an offer accepted now is worth more than the same offer accepted next round (value is multiplied by 0.9 each round).\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** I am offered [2, 1, 5, 0, 3].\n     - Value of current offer: (2 * 24) + (1 * 94) + (5 * 80) + (0 * 13) + (3 * 63) = 48 + 94 + 400 + 0 + 189 = 731\n   - **Compare to outside offer:** The current offer is worth 731. This is less than my outside offer of 1113.  Therefore, accepting is a bad idea.\n\n   - **Consider a potential counteroffer:** I need to find a counteroffer that gives me more than 1113 * 0.9 = 1001.7 if I believe that Player 2 might accept it in the final round. I must give Player 2 enough to be greater than his outside offer * 0.9. Let's experiment with a few possibilities:\n     - *Keeping most of the high-value items:* Let's say I offer [3, 2, 5, 3, 5] to Player 2, which would leave me with [2, 2, 0, 0, 0]. My value would be (2 * 24) + (2 * 94) = 48 + 188 = 236, which is less than even 1001.7.\n     - *Let me try an offer that gives an approximate value to the other player so as not to make mistake #3*. Offer [3,0,0,0,0]. This gives Player 2 a value of 24*3 = 72. My value is:\n       (2 * 24) + (4 * 94) + (5 * 80) + (3 * 13) + (5 * 63) = 48 + 376 + 400 + 39 + 315 = 1178\n     - *Offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] to Player 2*. This is potentially mistake #3 (offering nothing). My value is:\n       (5 * 24) + (4 * 94) + (5 * 80) + (3 * 13) + (5 * 63) = 120 + 376 + 400 + 39 + 315 = 1250\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - Accepting the current offer (731) is worse than walking away (1113).\n   - Offering [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] gives me the best value, but it's likely to be rejected.\n\nI will make an offer of [3,0,0,0,0] to Player 2 hoping that Player 2 has a low value for item 1 and will accept the offer. The alternative is to give Player 2 nothing and probably get nothing for the outcome in round 3.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

Your value would be:\n    66 x 0 + 83 x 2 + 10 x 1 + 4 x 8 + 44 x 1\n    which is 252 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 253. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 1, 8, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    66 x 0 + 83 x 2 + 10 x 1 + 4 x 8 + 44 x 1\n    which is 252 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 253. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 239. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 239. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 861 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 3, 2, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    88 x 2 + 12 x 3 + 13 x 2 + 93 x 0 + 81 x 0\n    which is 238 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 239. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

The discount factor influences the value of future offers because any deal made in later rounds is worth less than a deal made now.\n\n2) **Assessment of Offers:**\n\n*   Current offer: There is no current offer.\n*   Potential counteroffers: I need to formulate a counteroffer. I want to maximize my value while ensuring Player 2 receives enough to accept. I need to keep at least enough items to equal my outside offer, 239.\n\nLet's consider some possible scenarios for what I keep and offer:\n\n*   **Scenario 1: Keeping 2 of item 1, 1 of item 4, 1 of item 5**\n    *   Value = (2 * 88) + (1 * 93) + (1 * 81) = 176 + 93 + 81 = 350 > 239\n    *   Offer to Player 2: [2, 4, 3, 3, 3]\n*   **Scenario 2: Keeping 1 of item 1, 1 of item 4, 2 of item 5**\n    *   Value = (1 * 88) + (1 * 93) + (2 * 81) = 88 + 93 + 162 = 343 > 239\n    *   Offer to Player 2: [3, 4, 3, 3, 2]\n\nLet's start by making an offer that is a bit more favorable to me, while still leaving room for negotiation. I'll try to retain items with higher value to meet my target of exceeding my outside offer. I'll aim for a slightly aggressive offer to see how Player 2 responds in subsequent turns.\n\nLet's propose keeping: 2 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 1 of item 5\n\nValue to me: (2*88) + (0*12) + (0*13) + (1*93) + (1*81) = 176 + 0 + 0 + 93 + 81 = 350\nOffer to Player 2: [2, 4, 3, 3, 3]\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\nI will make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 4, 3, 3, 3]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 643. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1008 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 4, 2, 1, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    75 x 0 + 77 x 4 + 55 x 2 + 34 x 1 + 95 x 2\n    which is 642 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 643. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's start by analyzing the situation.\n\n1) **Current Situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 643.\n   - My values for items 1-5 are 75, 77, 55, 34, 95 respectively.\n   - The total pool of items is 5, 7, 5, 2, 5.\n   - The discount factor is 0.9. It means that the later the agreement, the lower the value for both players. So, it is better to make a deal now than later.\n\n2) **Assessing Offers:**\n   - There is no current offer on the table. I need to make an initial offer.\n   - I need to calculate the value of different potential counteroffers to find a good starting point.  I'll aim for a division that gives me more than 643, but also leaves something for Player 2 to accept.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\nI will start by making a counteroffer. I need to decide how many units of each item to offer Player 2. Since I want to secure a deal that is better than my outside offer, I will try to keep most of the items that I value more. Item 5 is the most valuable to me, followed by item 2, then item 1, then item 3, and finally item 4.\n\nLet's try offering Player 2: 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\nThis means I keep:\n3 units of item 1 = 3 * 75 = 225\n4 units of item 2 = 4 * 77 = 308\n3 units of item 3 = 3 * 55 = 165\n1 unit of item 4 = 1 * 34 = 34\n3 units of item 5 = 3 * 95 = 285\nTotal value = 225 + 308 + 165 + 34 + 285 = 1017\n\nThis is significantly higher than my outside offer of 643.\n\nNow, let's consider an alternative offer, offering Player 2 a bit more. Maybe: 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\nThis means I keep:\n2 units of item 1 = 2 * 75 = 150\n3 units of item 2 = 3 * 77 = 231\n2 units of item 3 = 2 * 55 = 110\n1 unit of item 4 = 1 * 34 = 34\n2 units of item 5 = 2 * 95 = 190\nTotal value = 150 + 231 + 110 + 34 + 190 = 715\n\nThis is still higher than my outside offer, but not as much. It might be a better offer to increase the chance of acceptance.\n\nNow I am ready to make my first offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 4, 3, 1, 3]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 1, 6, 3, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    99 x 4 + 95 x 1 + 13 x 6 + 95 x 3 + 3 x 0\n    which is 854 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 856. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

This means that an agreement in round 2 is worth 90% of an agreement in round 1, and an agreement in round 3 is worth 81% of an agreement in round 1.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find a division of items that gives me a value greater than 856.\n\n3) **Crafting a counteroffer:**\n\nLet's aim to create an initial offer that gives Player 2 a reasonable amount of items while still ensuring I get a value above my outside offer. I'll start by offering a relatively even split where possible. I will make sure that the offer is valid by ensuring I do not offer more than available.\n\nI'll try giving the other player: \n* Item 1: 2\n* Item 2: 0\n* Item 3: 3\n* Item 4: 1\n* Item 5: 2\n\nThis means I keep:\n* Item 1: 3\n* Item 2: 1\n* Item 3: 3\n* Item 4: 2\n* Item 5: 3\n\nMy value would then be:\n3 * 99 + 1 * 95 + 3 * 13 + 2 * 95 + 3 * 3 = 297 + 95 + 39 + 190 + 9 = 630\n\nThis is less than 856.\n\nLet's try an offer that is more favorable to me. I will attempt to offer them:\n* Item 1: 1\n* Item 2: 0\n* Item 3: 1\n* Item 4: 0\n* Item 5: 1\n\nThis means I keep:\n* Item 1: 4\n* Item 2: 1\n* Item 3: 5\n* Item 4: 3\n* Item 5: 4\n\nMy value would then be:\n4 * 99 + 1 * 95 + 5 * 13 + 3 * 95 + 4 * 3 = 396 + 95 + 65 + 285 + 12 = 853\n\nThis is still less than 856. Let's adjust slightly:\nOffer:\n* Item 1: 0\n* Item 2: 0\n* Item 3: 1\n* Item 4: 0\n* Item 5: 1\nKeep:\n* Item 1: 5\n* Item 2: 1\n* Item 3: 5\n* Item 4: 3\n* Item 5: 4\nValue: 5*99+1*95+5*13+3*95+4*3 = 495 + 95 + 65 + 285 + 12 = 952.\n\nThis is higher than my outside offer, so I will make this my counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 0, 1]}\n```",

I can either walk away or make a counteroffer.\n\nSince we're in round 2 of 3, if I make a counteroffer now, Player 1 would have the last move in round 3. I should make a reasonable counteroffer that might be accepted.\n\nI'll analyze what I know about Player 1's preferences from their consistent offer [0, 0, 1, 0, 1]:\n- They seem to value keeping items 1, 2, 4 while willing to give me some of items 3 and 5\n- They've rejected my previous offer of [2, 0, 2, 1, 3]\n\nLet me make a more attractive counteroffer.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 856. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 915 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 1, 6, 3, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    99 x 4 + 95 x 1 + 13 x 6 + 95 x 3 + 3 x 0\n    which is 854 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 856. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 1, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 0, 2, 1, 3]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 1, 0, 1]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [3, 0, 1, 1, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 0, 1, 1, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 856\n*   My item values: item 1 = 99, item 2 = 95, item 3 = 13, item 4 = 95, item 5 = 3\n*   Total items: item 1 = 5, item 2 = 1, item 3 = 6, item 4 = 3, item 5 = 5\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9.

Accepting the current offer is worse than my outside offer.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Let's evaluate a few potential counteroffers, focusing on giving away low-value items and keeping high-value items:\n\n    *   **Counteroffer 1:** I offer [0, 0, 3, 0, 3] to Player 2.\n        *   I keep [5, 1, 3, 3, 2].\n        *   Value to me: (5 * 99) + (1 * 95) + (3 * 13) + (3 * 95) + (2 * 3) = 495 + 95 + 39 + 285 + 6 = 920\n        *   Discounted value: 920 * 0.81 = 745.2\n        *   This is still worse than my outside offer.\n\n    *   **Counteroffer 2:** I offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 5] to Player 2.\n        *   I keep [5, 1, 6, 3, 0].\n        *   Value to me: (5 * 99) + (1 * 95) + (6 * 13) + (3 * 95) + (0 * 3) = 495 + 95 + 78 + 285 + 0 = 953\n        *   Discounted value: 953 * 0.81 = 771.93\n        *   Still worse than my outside offer.\n\n    *   **Counteroffer 3:** I offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 4] to Player 2.\n        *   I keep [5, 1, 6, 3, 1].\n        *   Value to me: (5 * 99) + (1 * 95) + (6 * 13) + (3 * 95) + (1 * 3) = 495 + 95 + 78 + 285 + 3 = 956\n        *   Discounted value: 956 * 0.81 = 774.36\n        *   Still worse than my outside offer.\n\n    *   **Counteroffer 4:** I offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] to Player 2.\n        *   I keep [5, 1, 6, 3, 5].\n        *   Value to me: (5 * 99) + (1 * 95) + (6 * 13) + (3 * 95) + (5 * 3) = 495 + 95 + 78 + 285 + 15 = 968\n        *   Discounted value: 968 * 0.81 = 784.08\n        *   Still worse than my outside offer.\n\nEven keeping everything doesn't get me a better discounted value than my outside offer. Because this is the final round, Player 2 will walk away if I make a counteroffer, so I need to compare the discounted value against my outside offer. If I accept, my value is only 448.74. If I walk away, my value is 856.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince the discounted value of the current offer (448.74) and all potential counteroffers are less than my outside offer (856), and this is the last round so a counteroffer will be interpreted as walking away, my best option is to WALK.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 1, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    68 x 0 + 15 x 3 + 13 x 1 + 86 x 0 + 96 x 2\n    which is 250 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 252. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 1, 1, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 3, 0, 1, 5]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 3, 0, 1, 5]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 252.\n   - My values for items 1-5 are 68, 15, 13, 86, 96, respectively.\n   - The total pool of items is 3, 4, 2, 3, 5, respectively.\n   - The discount factor is 0.9. Accepting later means getting 0.9 times the value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** I am being offered [1, 3, 0, 1, 5]. This means Player 2 is giving me 1 unit of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 5 units of item 5.\n   My value for this offer is (1 * 68) + (3 * 15) + (0 * 13) + (1 * 86) + (5 * 96) = 68 + 45 + 0 + 86 + 480 = 679.\n   Since 679 > 252, accepting this offer is better than walking away *now*.\n   However, because it is round 2, the real value is 679*0.9^(2-1) = 679*0.9 = 611.1\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** I need to keep in mind that Player 2 might have a high outside offer as well and will likely want to get most of the value. I also need to ensure my counteroffer is better than my outside offer value of 252.\n\nLet's evaluate a few potential counteroffers:\n    - Try to get most valuable items.\n    Suppose I offer [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]. Then I keep [3, 3, 2, 3, 5], which is (3 * 68) + (3 * 15) + (2 * 13) + (3 * 86) + (5 * 96) = 204 + 45 + 26 + 258 + 480 = 1013\n    Since 1013*0.9 = 911.7 > 611.1, there is scope for improvement in terms of counteroffers compared to accepting the current offer.\n\n    - Suppose I offer [1, 2, 0, 0, 1]. Then I keep [2, 2, 2, 3, 4], which is (2 * 68) + (2 * 15) + (2 * 13) + (3 * 86) + (4 * 96) = 136 + 30 + 26 + 258 + 384 = 834\n    Since 834*0.9 = 750.6 > 611.1, there is scope for improvement in terms of counteroffers compared to accepting the current offer.\n    \n    - Suppose I offer [1, 3, 0, 1, 4]. Then I keep [2, 1, 2, 2, 1], which is (2 * 68) + (1 * 15) + (2 * 13) + (2 * 86) + (1 * 96) = 136 + 15 + 26 + 172 + 96 = 445\n    Since 445*0.9 = 400.5 > 252, and offering [1, 3, 0, 1, 4] still brings me a profit.\n\n    - Suppose I offer [1, 3, 0, 2, 5]. Then I keep [2, 1, 2, 1, 0], which is (2 * 68) + (1 * 15) + (2 * 13) + (1 * 86) + (0 * 96) = 136 + 15 + 26 + 86 + 0 = 263\n    Since 263*0.9 = 236.7 < 252, this is worse than the outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - Accepting the current offer yields 611.1.\n   - Walking away yields 252.\n   - Offering [1, 3, 0, 0, 0] yields 911.7.\n   - Offering [1, 3, 0, 1, 4] yields 400.5.\n\nSince offering [1, 3, 0, 0, 0] to Player 2 makes me the most profit, and given my outside offer is 252, I'll make this as the counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 3, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 1, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    68 x 0 + 15 x 3 + 13 x 1 + 86 x 0 + 96 x 2\n    which is 250 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 252. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 1, 1, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 3, 0, 1, 5]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [1, 3, 0, 2, 5]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 3, 0, 2, 5]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best course of action in round 3.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** 252\n*   **Item values:** Item 1: 68, Item 2: 15, Item 3: 13, Item 4: 86, Item 5: 96\n*   **Total items:** Item 1: 3, Item 2: 4, Item 3: 2, Item 4: 3, Item 5: 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that accepting an offer in round 3 has a present value of 0.9^(3-1) = 0.81 times the face value of the offer.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [1, 3, 0, 2, 5].

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 3, 5, 3, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    62 x 4 + 34 x 3 + 28 x 5 + 95 x 3 + 15 x 0\n    which is 775 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 776. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [4, 1, 4, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [4, 1, 4, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the optimal action.\n\n1. **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n   - My outside offer value: 776\n   - My item values: item 1: 62, item 2: 34, item 3: 28, item 4: 95, item 5: 15\n   - Total items: item 1: 6, item 2: 4, item 3: 5, item 4: 3, item 5: 4\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its face value to me.\n\n2. **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer:** I am being offered [4, 1, 4, 1, 1]. This means I keep:\n     - item 1: 6 - 4 = 2\n     - item 2: 4 - 1 = 3\n     - item 3: 5 - 4 = 1\n     - item 4: 3 - 1 = 2\n     - item 5: 4 - 1 = 3\n     - My value from this offer is: 2 * 62 + 3 * 34 + 1 * 28 + 2 * 95 + 3 * 15 = 124 + 102 + 28 + 190 + 45 = 489\n     - Discounted value of this offer: 489 * 0.9 = 440.1. This is much less than my outside offer of 776.\n\n   - **Round 1 Offer Analysis:** Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 0, 0] to Player 2. This means Player 1 would be getting: 5*62 + 3*34 + 4*28 + 3*95 + 4*15 = 310+102+112+285+60 = 869\n\n   - **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to create a counteroffer that's better than my outside offer when discounted by 0.9. Let's aim for a value of at least 776/0.9 = 862.22 before discounting.\n\n3. **Developing a good counteroffer:** Given the opponent's offer was quite bad, I'll make an offer that favors me but is reasonable. I value item 4 (value 95) very highly. So, I would not want to give much of item 4 to Player 2. I also value item 1(value 62) somewhat highly. In contrast, items 3 and 5 are relatively low in value to me.\n\n   - Let's try to keep 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 2. Let me offer 4 item 1, 1 item 2, 0 item 4.\n   - Then calculate how many of the others I can keep. My values would be:\n   - Let's assume my proposed counteroffer is: [4, 1, 2, 0, 2] . This is what I offer to Player 2.\n   - What I would keep: 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5.\n   - Value of this: 2*62 + 3*34 + 3*28 + 3*95 + 2*15 = 124 + 102 + 84 + 285 + 30 = 625.\n   - This is still not good enough. I must offer less if I want a value higher than 862.22\n\n   - Let's try the offer: [3, 0, 3, 0, 3].\n   - This means I keep 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5.\n   - Value of this is: 3*62 + 4*34 + 2*28 + 3*95 + 1*15 = 186 + 136 + 56 + 285 + 15 = 678\n   - still below 862.22, but closer.\n\n   - Lets try the offer [2, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n   - This means I keep: 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5\n   - Value: 4*62 + 4*34 + 4*28 + 3*95 + 4*15 = 248 + 136 + 112 + 285 + 60 = 841\n   - Still not there, a little bit short.\n\n   - Lets try the offer [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n   - This means I keep: 5 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5\n   - Value: 5*62 + 4*34 + 4*28 + 3*95 + 4*15 = 310 + 136 + 112 + 285 + 60 = 903\n   - 903*0.9 = 812.7 > 776. So, this is a good offer for me. I propose this as counteroffer.\n\n4. **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   - Accepting the current offer is bad (value 440.1 < 776).\n   - I have calculated a counteroffer that results in a discounted value of 812.7, which is better than my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]}\n```",

This means my kept items must be worth more than 776/0.81 = 958.02\n\n    Let's evaluate what happens if I keep everything, offer nothing:\n    * Value of item 1: 6 * 62 = 372\n    * Value of item 2: 4 * 34 = 136\n    * Value of item 3: 5 * 28 = 140\n    * Value of item 4: 3 * 95 = 285\n    * Value of item 5: 4 * 15 = 60\n    * Total value of keeping everything: 372 + 136 + 140 + 285 + 60 = 993\n    * Discounted value: 993 * 0.81 = 804.33\n    \n    I'll now try several offers to determine a possible optimal approach.\n\n    If I offer [0,0,0,0,0]:\n    My total discounted value is 804.33, which is higher than my outside option.\n\n    If I offer [1,1,1,1,1]:\n    I keep [5,3,4,2,3]\n    My value is (5*62)+(3*34)+(4*28)+(2*95)+(3*15) = 310+102+112+190+45 = 759.\n    My discounted value is 759 * 0.81 = 614.79, which is lower than my outside option.\n\n    Given this is the last round, Player 2 making a counteroffer is the same as walking away. Thus, the best strategy is to make an offer that, if rejected, results in both of us walking away.\n\n    Since this is the last round, and Player 2's offer is terrible for me, I should make a counteroffer that will likely be rejected, or simply walk away.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince my outside offer is much better than what Player 2 is offering me, I will propose a counteroffer that is likely to be rejected. I will offer only one unit of each item to Player 2 to test the waters. If this counteroffer is rejected, I will walk away.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [5, 3, 4, 2, 3]}\n",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 6, 0, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    88 x 3 + 88 x 6 + 1 x 0 + 78 x 1 + 33 x 3\n    which is 969 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 970. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 970. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 970. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 864 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 6, 0, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    88 x 3 + 88 x 6 + 1 x 0 + 78 x 1 + 33 x 3\n    which is 969 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 970. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 3, 0, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 3, 0, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its value, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 0.9^2 = 0.81 times its value. Waiting for a potentially better offer in a later round has a cost.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [1, 3, 0, 1, 2]. This means I would get:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 88 = 88\n    *   3 units of item 2: 3 * 88 = 264\n    *   0 units of item 3: 0 * 1 = 0\n    *   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 78 = 78\n    *   2 units of item 5: 2 * 33 = 66\n    *   Total value of current offer: 88 + 264 + 0 + 78 + 66 = 496.\n\n    Since this is round 2, accepting this would give me a discounted value of 496 * 0.9 = 446.4, which is much lower than my outside offer of 970.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to keep at least enough items to get a value greater than 970. Let's try to find an offer that gives me a value close to 970 after discounting.\n\n    The total value of all items to me is (5 * 88) + (6 * 88) + (2 * 1) + (1 * 78) + (5 * 33) = 440 + 528 + 2 + 78 + 165 = 1213.\n\n    I need to find a counteroffer where my value is higher than 970 / 0.9 = 1077.78.\n\n    If I offer Player 2 [1, 0, 0, 0, 0], I keep [4, 6, 2, 1, 5] giving me a value of 4*88 + 6*88 + 2*1 + 1*78 + 5*33 = 352 + 528 + 2 + 78 + 165 = 1125.\n    1125 * 0.9 = 1012.5, which is greater than my outside offer.\n\n    If I offer Player 2 [0, 1, 0, 0, 0], I keep [5, 5, 2, 1, 5] giving me a value of 5*88 + 5*88 + 2*1 + 1*78 + 5*33 = 440 + 440 + 2 + 78 + 165 = 1125.\n    1125 * 0.9 = 1025.5, which is greater than my outside offer.\n\n    If I offer Player 2 [0, 0, 1, 0, 0], I keep [5, 6, 1, 1, 5] giving me a value of 5*88 + 6*88 + 1*1 + 1*78 + 5*33 = 440 + 528 + 1 + 78 + 165 = 1212.\n    1212 * 0.9 = 1090.8, which is greater than my outside offer.\n\n    If I offer Player 2 [0, 0, 0, 1, 0], I keep [5, 6, 2, 0, 5] giving me a value of 5*88 + 6*88 + 2*1 + 0*78 + 5*33 = 440 + 528 + 2 + 0 + 165 = 1135.\n    1135 * 0.9 = 1021.5, which is greater than my outside offer.\n\n    If I offer Player 2 [0, 0, 0, 0, 1], I keep [5, 6, 2, 1, 4] giving me a value of 5*88 + 6*88 + 2*1 + 1*78 + 4*33 = 440 + 528 + 2 + 78 + 132 = 1180.\n    1180 * 0.9 = 1062, which is greater than my outside offer.\n\n    Since I want to maximize my value, I'll aim for a counteroffer with higher value.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is worth 446.4 to me (discounted), which is much less than my outside offer of 970. So, I shouldn't accept.\n*   I should not walk away yet, as there are likely mutually beneficial deals possible.\n*   I will propose a counteroffer. I will offer the other player slightly more than I did in the previous round.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 3, 1, 1, 2]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's start by analyzing the situation.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value: 1734\n   - Item values: item 1: 50, item 2: 93, item 3: 55, item 4: 98, item 5: 87\n   - Total items: item 1: 7, item 2: 5, item 3: 5, item 4: 8, item 5: 1\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means that offers in later rounds are worth less to me in present value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer: None. I need to make the first offer.\n   - Potential counteroffers: I need to figure out a good offer to start with. I want to maximize my value while also giving the other player enough to make them want to accept, rather than walk away or counteroffer repeatedly.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince there's no current offer, I need to make one. I need to propose an offer (items I give to Player 2) that will likely be accepted or at least lead to a negotiation ending in a deal better than my outside option. I will start with an equal split. I need to ensure my value after the split is greater than my outside offer.\n\nLet's first calculate what an equal split would look like:\n\nItem 1: 7 / 2 = 3.5. Since we can only deal with integers, I'll try giving the other player 3. This means I keep 4. My value: 4 * 50 = 200\nItem 2: 5 / 2 = 2.5. I'll give the other player 2. This means I keep 3. My value: 3 * 93 = 279\nItem 3: 5 / 2 = 2.5. I'll give the other player 2. This means I keep 3. My value: 3 * 55 = 165\nItem 4: 8 / 2 = 4. I'll give the other player 4. This means I keep 4. My value: 4 * 98 = 392\nItem 5: 1 / 2 = 0.5. I'll give the other player 0. This means I keep 1. My value: 1 * 87 = 87\n\nTotal value to me: 200 + 279 + 165 + 392 + 87 = 1123\n\nThis is worse than my outside offer.\n\nLet's iterate again. My outside offer is 1734.\nI will try to be greedy.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [6, 4, 5, 8, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    50 x 6 + 93 x 4 + 55 x 5 + 98 x 8 + 87 x 0\n    which is 1731 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1734. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 1, 4, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 4, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

It will be difficult to get a value higher than my outside offer. I have no other choice but to offer a counteroffer.\n      Let's try: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], meaning I keep all the items.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [6, 4, 5, 8, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    50 x 6 + 93 x 4 + 55 x 5 + 98 x 8 + 87 x 0\n    which is 1731 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1734. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 1, 4, 2, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 5, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 5, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 0, 3, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    97 x 1 + 26 x 1 + 71 x 0 + 4 x 3 + 65 x 0\n    which is 135 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 138. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's start by analyzing the situation.\n\n1) **Current Situation:**\n   - My outside offer value: 138\n   - My values for the items: item 1: 97, item 2: 26, item 3: 71, item 4: 4, item 5: 65\n   - Total pool of items: item 1: 4, item 2: 1, item 3: 0, item 4: 5, item 5: 5\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means that a deal in round 2 is worth 90% of a deal in round 1, and a deal in round 3 is worth 81% of a deal in round 1.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer: There is no current offer.\n   - Potential counteroffers: I need to consider different possible divisions and calculate their values.  I need to ensure I get at least 138 value to beat my outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n   - I will start by constructing a counteroffer. I want to make an offer that is reasonable, leaving the other player enough value to consider accepting.\n\nLet's try an offer where I keep 2 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 3, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    22 x 0 + 52 x 1 + 56 x 3 + 23 x 1 + 22 x 3\n    which is 309 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 310. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and decide on the best action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value: 310\n   - My values for items: item 1: 22, item 2: 52, item 3: 56, item 4: 23, item 5: 22\n   - Total pool of items: item 1: 5, item 2: 3, item 3: 3, item 4: 1, item 5: 5\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.9.  This means that offers in later rounds are worth less to me.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer: There is no current offer.\n   - Potential counteroffers: I need to consider different divisions and calculate their value to me.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - Since there's no current offer, I need to propose a counteroffer. I want to make an offer that is likely to be accepted but also maximizes my value. I need to propose a counteroffer such that what I retain is worth more to me than my outside offer of 310.\n\nLet's consider a few potential counteroffers, focusing on giving Player 2 more of the items I value less and keeping more of items I value more:\n\n*   **Attempt 1:** Offer Player 2: [3, 1, 1, 0, 3]. This means I keep [2, 2, 2, 1, 2].  My value would be 2 * 22 + 2 * 52 + 2 * 56 + 1 * 23 + 2 * 22 = 44 + 104 + 112 + 23 + 44 = 327. This is greater than my outside offer of 310.\n\n*   **Attempt 2:** Offer Player 2: [4, 2, 2, 0, 4]. This means I keep [1, 1, 1, 1, 1].  My value would be 1 * 22 + 1 * 52 + 1 * 56 + 1 * 23 + 1 * 22 = 22 + 52 + 56 + 23 + 22 = 175. This is less than my outside offer of 310.\n\nTherefore, the offer in Attempt 1 is better than my outside offer and should be presented.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 1, 1, 0, 3]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best course of action.\n\n**1. Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** 310\n*   **Item values:** Item 1: 22, Item 2: 52, Item 3: 56, Item 4: 23, Item 5: 22\n*   **Total items:** Item 1: 5, Item 2: 3, Item 3: 3, Item 4: 1, Item 5: 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its face value. An offer in round 3 is worth 0.81 times its face value.\n\n**2. Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [3, 2, 1, 1, 2]. This means I would receive:\n    *   Item 1: 3 units\n    *   Item 2: 2 units\n    *   Item 3: 1 unit\n    *   Item 4: 1 unit\n    *   Item 5: 2 units\n    My total value if I accept the current offer:\n    (3 * 22) + (2 * 52) + (1 * 56) + (1 * 23) + (2 * 22) = 66 + 104 + 56 + 23 + 44 = 293\n    Value after discount (round 2): 293 * 0.9 = 263.7\n\n*   **Round 1 Offer to Me:** Player 1 (myself) offered Player 2 [3, 1, 1, 0, 3]. So player 2 received [3, 1, 1, 0, 3] and I had\n       * Item 1: 2 units\n       * Item 2: 2 units\n       * Item 3: 2 units\n       * Item 4: 1 units\n       * Item 5: 2 units\n    My total value for that split would be:\n    (2 * 22) + (2 * 52) + (2 * 56) + (1 * 23) + (2 * 22) = 44 + 104 + 112 + 23 + 44 = 327\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find an offer that gives me more than 310 * 0.9 = 279 to beat my outside offer. I also need to be aware that I need to make an offer that is better than what I offered in Round 1 to prevent Mistake 1.\n    I need to think carefully here, since the round 1 offer I made was better than my outside offer.\n\nLet's look at the current offer and consider a reasonable counteroffer. In the current offer, I get 263.7, much less than my outside offer. I had to offer 3, 1, 1, 0, 3, so now I want to counteroffer with something less than that. Since player 2 is offering [3, 2, 1, 1, 2] I will try to reduce the quantity on item 2 and item 4 that I am offering them from round 1. Let me consider offering them [3, 1, 1, 0, 3]. This would mean I get: 2 * 22 + 2 * 52 + 2 * 56 + 1 * 23 + 2 * 22 = 327 before discount. If I offer that same amount again, then I am guaranteed to get at least 327 * 0.9 = 294.3 value in round 3 (since player 2 might accept the current offer).\nNow let me consider an offer that is better for me: [4, 1, 1, 0, 4]. If I give this to player 2, I get: 1 * 22 + 2 * 52 + 2 * 56 + 1 * 23 + 1 * 22 = 22 + 104 + 112 + 23 + 22 = 283\nWhich after discount gives me 254.7 so is not optimal.\n\nLet me consider an offer that is worse for me, for the sake of analysis. What if I offer them [2, 0, 0, 0, 2]? This means I get: 3 * 22 + 3 * 52 + 3 * 56 + 1 * 23 + 3 * 22 = 66 + 156 + 168 + 23 + 66 = 479\nThis after discount gives me 431.1.\n\n**3. Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is worth 263.7, which is less than my outside offer (310). So I should not accept it.\n*   I could walk away and get 310.\n*   I could make a counteroffer.\n\nGiven the negotiation history and the potential for future gains, I will make a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 3, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    22 x 0 + 52 x 1 + 56 x 3 + 23 x 1 + 22 x 3\n    which is 309 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 310. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1132. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 747 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 3, 7, 6, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    68 x 4 + 49 x 3 + 88 x 7 + 2 x 6 + 42 x 2\n    which is 1131 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1132. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 801. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 801. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 912 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 3, 5, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    91 x 1 + 42 x 1 + 94 x 3 + 73 x 5 + 4 x 5\n    which is 800 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 801. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

This means I receive 1 unit of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n      - Value of current offer: (1 * 91) + (4 * 42) + (2 * 94) + (3 * 73) + (1 * 4) = 91 + 168 + 188 + 219 + 4 = 670\n      - Discounted value of current offer: 670 * 0.9 = 603\n      - Since 603 < 801, accepting this offer would be worse than walking away right now.\n\n   - Consider Player 1's previous offer: [2, 2, 1, 4, 3].\n      - Implies I would receive: 3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5\n      - Value of previous offer (to me): (3 * 91) + (2 * 42) + (2 * 94) + (4 * 73) + (3 * 4) = 273 + 84 + 188 + 292 + 12 = 849\n      - Discounted value of the round 1 offer: 849 * 0.9 = 764.1 < 801\n      - The original offer from player 1 in round 1 is still worse than walking away (assuming the discount rate is applied after only one round).\n\n3) **Potential Counteroffers**\n\nLet's try to find a counteroffer that is better than walking away, and consider the time discounting. Since this is round 2, the final round is round 3, so the maximum discount factor we have to deal with is 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81.\n\nI currently have 670 value and my outside offer is 801. Therefore I need at least 801/0.9 = 890 from a round 2 agreement, or 801/0.81 = 989 from a round 3 agreement.\n\nLet's propose keeping the following items for myself and offering the rest: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\nValue of counteroffer to me: (5 * 91) + (4 * 42) + (3 * 94) + (8 * 73) + (6 * 4) = 455 + 168 + 282 + 584 + 24 = 1513\nValue to me after round 2: 1513 * 0.9 = 1361.7. This exceeds the 801 I could get if I walked away.\nPlayer 2 gets nothing from this offer. This is unlikely to be accepted but lets start with that as a counteroffer.\n\nI will make a counteroffer that gives the other player nothing.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

However, since we're only in round 2, I'll try one more counteroffer that gives me enough value to beat my outside offer, but potentially offers something desirable to Player 1.\n\nI'll offer [0, 4, 1, 3, 1], which means I keep:\n- 5 units of item 1: 5\u00d785 = 425\n- 0 units of item 2: 0\u00d71 = 0\n- 2 units of item 3: 2\u00d718 = 36\n- 5 units of item 4: 5\u00d759 = 295\n- 5 units of item 5: 5\u00d773 = 365\nTotal for me: 1121\n\nWith discount factor: 1121 \u00d7 0.9 = 1008.9\n\nThis is less than my outside offer, but if Player 1 rejects and we go to round 3, the discount would make my outside offer worth 1298 \u00d7 0.9 = 1168.2, which is still better than this counteroffer after another round of discounting.\n\nGiven that Player 1's zero offer is unreasonable, I think the best move is to WALK away.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",
