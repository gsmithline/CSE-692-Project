Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 145. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 145. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 696 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 0, 0, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    16 x 3 + 46 x 0 + 100 x 0 + 23 x 0 + 47 x 2\n    which is 142 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 145. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

                    "response": "I need to analyze the negotiation situation and propose a strategic initial offer.\n\n## Step 1: Analyze the current situation\n\n- My outside offer value: 145\n- My item values: \n  - Item 1: 16 per unit (4 units total)\n  - Item 2: 46 per unit (6 units total)\n  - Item 3: 100 per unit (3 units total)\n  - Item 4: 23 per unit (7 units total)\n  - Item 5: 47 per unit (3 units total)\n- Total pool: 4 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 7 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5\n- Discount factor: 0.9 (each round reduces value by 10%)\n\n## Step 2: Calculate total possible value\n\nTotal possible value if I keep everything:\n- Item 1: 4 \u00d7 16 = 64\n- Item 2: 6 \u00d7 46 = 276\n- Item 3: 3 \u00d7 100 = 300\n- Item 4: 7 \u00d7 23 = 161\n- Item 5: 3 \u00d7 47 = 141\n- Total: 942\n\nThis is much higher than my outside offer of 145, so I should aim to reach a deal.\n\n## Step 3: Consider a strategic first offer\n\nI should prioritize keeping high-value items for myself, especially item 3 (value 100). I should be more willing to give away lower-value items like item 1 (value 16) and item 4 (value 23).\n\nLet me propose an offer where I keep most of my high-value items:\n- Give 3 units of item 1 (keeping 1) = I keep 16\n- Give 2 units of item 2 (keeping 4) = I keep 184\n- Give 0 units of item 3 (keeping 3) = I keep 300\n- Give 4 units of item 4 (keeping 3) = I keep 69\n- Give 1 unit of item 5 (keeping 2) = I keep 94\n\nTotal value for me: 16 + 184 + 300 + 69 + 94 = 663\n\nThis is significantly above my outside offer of 145, so it's a good starting point. The offer to Player 2 would be [3, 2, 0, 4, 1].\n\n## Step 4: Check for potential mistakes\n\n- This offer is better than my outside offer (663 > 145) \u2713\n- I'm not offering no items or all items \u2713\n- This is my first offer, so I can't make an offer worse than my previous one \u2713\n- I'm not accepting anything yet \u2713\n- I'm not walking away from anything better than my outside offer \u2713\n\nThis seems like a reasonable starting offer. It's biased toward my interests (as is common in negotiations) but still gives the other player a substantial portion of items. I'll make this counteroffer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 2, 0, 4, 1]}",

I need to figure out what Player 1's values might be to craft an offer they might accept. I don't know their values. If I walk, I get 524. If I make a counteroffer and they accept, I need the value of the items I keep to be greater than 524, taking into account the discount factor. Since it's round 1, the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 1.\n\nI'll aim for a split that's closer to even, but still somewhat favorable to me, and see if Player 1 accepts. Given my relatively high outside option, and the lack of information on Player 1's preferences, I will propose something that is advantageous for me and hope Player 1 will take it.\n\nI will offer them:\n* Item 1: 2 (leaving me with 2)\n* Item 2: 3 (leaving me with 3)\n* Item 3: 1 (leaving me with 2)\n* Item 4: 3 (leaving me with 4)\n* Item 5: 1 (leaving me with 2)\n\nMy value if they accept:\n* 2 * 24 + 3 * 40 + 2 * 42 + 4 * 9 + 2 * 45 = 48 + 120 + 84 + 36 + 90 = 378.\n\nSince this is less than my outside offer, I will walk to secure my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 2, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    33 x 0 + 99 x 1 + 48 x 2 + 74 x 0 + 37 x 2\n    which is 269 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 270. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 270. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 873 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 2, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    33 x 0 + 99 x 1 + 48 x 2 + 74 x 0 + 37 x 2\n    which is 269 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 270. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [4, 1, 3, 0, 6]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. It's round 2, and Player 1 has offered me [5, 1, 2, 0, 5] units of items 1 through 5 respectively. My private values are 31, 53, 30, 59, and 94 for items 1 through 5. My outside offer is 1360. The discount factor is 0.9.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the value of Player 1's current offer to me:\n\n*   Item 1: 5 * 31 = 155\n*   Item 2: 1 * 53 = 53\n*   Item 3: 2 * 30 = 60\n*   Item 4: 0 * 59 = 0\n*   Item 5: 5 * 94 = 470\n*   Total value = 155 + 53 + 60 + 0 + 470 = 738\n\nSince it is round 2, I must also take into account the discount factor of 0.9. So the discounted value of Player 1's current offer is 738 * 0.9 = 664.2. This value is less than my outside offer of 1360, so accepting this offer is not in my best interest.\n\nNext, I need to consider making a counteroffer. Since it's round 2, I need to determine if there is a better counteroffer I can make which is above my outside option. Because this is the second round, I would have to calculate what I believe the other player would accept, discounted by the 0.9 factor.\n\nLet's consider making an offer close to an equal split, but slightly more favorable to me than Player 1's offer. I have a total of 7 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 9 units of item 5 to divide.\n\nLet's consider the reverse of Player 1's offer as a counteroffer. That would involve me offering Player 1: 7 - 5 = 2 units of item 1, 5 - 1 = 4 units of item 2, 5 - 2 = 3 units of item 3, 2 - 0 = 2 units of item 4, and 9 - 5 = 4 units of item 5. So my counteroffer would be [2, 4, 3, 2, 4].\n\nThe value of this counteroffer to me would be:\n*   Item 1: 5 * 31 = 155\n*   Item 2: 1 * 53 = 53\n*   Item 3: 2 * 30 = 60\n*   Item 4: 0 * 59 = 0\n*   Item 5: 5 * 94 = 470\n*   Total value = 155 + 53 + 60 + 0 + 470 = 738\nAnd taking discount factor into account: 738 * 0.9 = 664.2.\n\nHowever, I realize there is no point in continuing negotiations as the maximum I can get is 1596 discounted by 0.9 squared, which is still below my outside offer.\n\nTherefore, my best course of action is to walk away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Since my outside offer is only 65, I should try to keep items worth significantly more than 65.\n\nLet me consider my item values from highest to lowest:\n- Item 4: 54 per unit (highest value)\n- Item 5: 44 per unit\n- Item 1: 22 per unit\n- Item 2: 11 per unit\n- Item 3: 5 per unit (lowest value)\n\nI should prioritize keeping the high-value items (4 and 5) and be more willing to give away low-value items (especially 3).\n\n### 4) Proposed Offer:\nLet me create an offer that gives Player 2 primarily the items I value less:\n- Item 1: Give 3 units, keep 4 units (keeping 4\u00d722 = 88)\n- Item 2: Give 0 units, keep 1 unit (keeping 1\u00d711 = 11)\n- Item 3: Give 3 units, keep 0 units (keeping 0\u00d75 = 0)\n- Item 4: Give 1 unit, keep 3 units (keeping 3\u00d754 = 162)\n- Item 5: Give 1 unit, keep 4 units (keeping 4\u00d744 = 176)\n\nThis means I keep [4,1,0,3,4] with a value of 88+11+0+162+176 = 437, which is much higher than my outside offer of 65.\n\nThis gives Player 2 [3,0,3,1,1], which seems reasonable as an opening offer.\n\n### 5) Verification:\n- Is my offer worse than my outside offer? No, 437 > 65\n- Am I offering nothing or everything? No, I'm offering a reasonable distribution\n- Does this seem like a fair starting position? Yes, I'm keeping higher-value items but offering a substantial portion (8 out of 20 items)\n\nTherefore, my initial counteroffer is [3,0,3,1,1] (what I give to Player 2).\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3,0,3,1,1]}",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    21 x 0 + 86 x 0 + 72 x 0 + 43 x 0 + 4 x 2\n    which is 8 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 11. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Item 5 has very little value to me, so I can offer most of those.

Since this is the first round, I'm going to make an offer that is closer to even, but still favors my higher value items:\n\n- Item 1: 1\n- Item 2: 2\n- Item 3: 3\n- Item 4: 3\n- Item 5: 3\n\nThis means I would get:\n- Item 1: 1\n- Item 2: 2\n- Item 3: 3\n- Item 4: 2\n- Item 5: 2\n\nThe value of this counteroffer to me is:\n(1 * 18) + (2 * 99) + (3 * 75) + (2 * 1) + (2 * 10) = 18 + 198 + 225 + 2 + 20 = 463\n\nOkay, I'll make this counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 3, 3, 3]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 11. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 678 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    21 x 0 + 86 x 0 + 72 x 0 + 43 x 0 + 4 x 2\n    which is 8 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 11. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 2, 2, 4]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 2, 3, 3, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 3, 3, 3]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "I need to analyze the current situation and make an informed decision. Let's proceed step by step:\n\n## 1. Analyzing the current situation:\n\n- My outside offer value: 11\n- My item values: Item 1 = 21, Item 2 = 86, Item 3 = 72, Item 4 = 43, Item 5 = 4\n- Total pool: 2 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5\n- Discount factor: \u03b3 = 0.9 (we're in round 2, so current value will be multiplied by \u03b3\u00b9 = 0.9)\n\n## 2. Assessing the value of the current offer:\n\nCurrent offer gives me: [1, 2, 3, 3, 3]\nThis means Player 2 gets: [1, 2, 3, 2, 2]\n\nMy value from this offer:\n- 1 unit of item 1: 1 \u00d7 21 = 21\n- 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 86 = 172\n- 3 units of item 3: 3 \u00d7 72 = 216\n- 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 43 = 129\n- 3 units of item 5: 3 \u00d7 4 = 12\nTotal value = 550\n\nWith discount factor: 550 \u00d7 0.9 = 495\n\nThis is significantly better than my outside offer of 11.\n\n## 3. Considering a potential counteroffer:\n\nLet me try to improve my position by keeping more of the valuable items (items 2 and 3):\n\nPotential counteroffer to Player 2: [1, 1, 2, 2, 4]\nThis means I keep: [1, 3, 4, 3, 1]\n\nMy value from this counteroffer:\n- 1 unit of item 1: 1 \u00d7 21 = 21\n- 3 units of item 2: 3 \u00d7 86 = 258\n- 4 units of item 3: 4 \u00d7 72 = 288\n- 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 43 = 129\n- 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 4 = 4\nTotal value = 700\n\nWith discount factor (if accepted in the next round): 700 \u00d7 0.9\u00b2 = 567\n\nThis is a bit better than accepting the current offer (495), but the improvement isn't huge and there's risk Player 2 won't accept.\n\nHowever, I notice this is the same offer I already made in Round 1, which Player 2 rejected. Making the same offer again is unlikely to be productive.\n\nLet me try a slight modification:\n\nCounteroffer to Player 2: [1, 1, 3, 2, 4]\nThis means I keep: [1, 3, 3, 3, 1]\n\nMy value:\n- 1 unit of item 1: 1 \u00d7 21 = 21\n- 3 units of item 2: 3 \u00d7 86 = 258\n- 3 units of item 3: 3 \u00d7 72 = 216\n- 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 43 = 129\n- 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 4 = 4\nTotal value = 628\n\n## 4. Decision:\n\nLooking at their offer, Player 2 is asking for fewer units of item 5, which aligns with my low value for it. They want more of items 1, 3, and 4, which suggests these items might be more valuable to them.\n\nConsidering:\n1. The current offer already gives me a value of 495 (with discount), which is much better than my outside offer.\n2. A counteroffer risks another round of negotiation, applying another discount factor.\n3. My proposed counteroffer (offering more of item 3) may not be accepted.\n\nGiven that the current offer is already quite good, and we're in round 2 with a discount factor in play, I believe accepting is the best strategy.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

To make a reasonable counteroffer, I need to estimate Player 1's values. Since I don't know their values, I will try to offer them an equal division and see if they accept.\n- Item 1: I keep 2 units, they get 3 units\n- Item 2: I keep 2 units, they get 2 units\n- Item 3: I keep 1 unit, they get 2 units\n- Item 4: I keep 0 unit, they get 1 units\n- Item 5: I keep 2 units, they get 3 units\n\nMy value for this allocation is:\n(2 * 77) + (2 * 37) + (1 * 27) + (0 * 38) + (2 * 51) = 154 + 74 + 27 + 0 + 102 = 357\n\nSince 357 is slightly better than my outside offer of 349, this counteroffer is worth making.\n\nSo I'll make this counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 2, 2, 1, 3]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 3, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    80 x 1 + 21 x 0 + 42 x 3 + 16 x 0 + 77 x 0\n    which is 206 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 210. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 2, 2, 1, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 2, 2, 1, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the current offer to me. The current offer is that I receive [5, 0, 7, 5, 0] which means Player 1 receives [1, 3, 0, 1, 6]. However, the offer on the table represents what is offered *to me*. So:\n\n*   5 units of item 1: 5 * 56 = 280\n*   0 units of item 2: 0 * 98 = 0\n*   7 units of item 3: 7 * 65 = 455\n*   5 units of item 4: 5 * 36 = 180\n*   0 units of item 5: 0 * 8 = 0\n*   Total value of current offer: 280 + 0 + 455 + 180 + 0 = 915\n\nNow, let's compare this to my outside offer, which is 1242. Since 915 < 1242, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away *even before applying the discount factor*. Therefore, I should not accept the current offer.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. It is round 1, so I have two more chances to reach an agreement. I need to consider what would be a reasonable counteroffer that Player 1 might accept. A good starting point for Player 2 in these negotiations is typically to offer something that leaves me with just a bit more than my outside option, and see if Player 1 takes it. I am going to try to obtain a deal that is close to evenly split based on valuation.\n\nHere's the total possible value of the items:\n* Item 1: 6 * 56 = 336\n* Item 2: 3 * 98 = 294\n* Item 3: 7 * 65 = 455\n* Item 4: 6 * 36 = 216\n* Item 5: 6 * 8 = 48\n* Total Value = 336 + 294 + 455 + 216 + 48 = 1349\n\nI want at least 1242 to be better than my outside offer. I am going to give Player 1 a low offer.\n\nLet's try offering Player 1 [5, 1, 6, 5, 5]. This means I keep [1, 2, 1, 1, 1].\n\n* 1 unit of item 1: 1 * 56 = 56\n* 2 units of item 2: 2 * 98 = 196\n* 1 units of item 3: 1 * 65 = 65\n* 1 units of item 4: 1 * 36 = 36\n* 1 units of item 5: 1 * 8 = 8\n* Total value to me: 56 + 196 + 65 + 36 + 8 = 361\n\nThis is too low. I need to get closer to my outside offer. Let's offer Player 1 [1, 0, 0, 1, 0] instead, leaving me with [5, 3, 7, 5, 6].\n* 5 units of item 1: 5 * 56 = 280\n* 3 units of item 2: 3 * 98 = 294\n* 7 units of item 3: 7 * 65 = 455\n* 5 units of item 4: 5 * 36 = 180\n* 6 units of item 5: 6 * 8 = 48\n* Total value to me: 280 + 294 + 455 + 180 + 48 = 1257\n\nThis offer gives me 1257.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 3, 1, 0, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    19 x 1 + 91 x 3 + 18 x 1 + 29 x 0 + 58 x 5\n    which is 600 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 601. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [5, 0, 7, 5, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

This suggests Player 2 values these items more than the others.\n   \n   Let me try to offer slightly more favorable terms than the current offer, while still ensuring I stay well above my outside offer:\n   \n   If I offer [2, 0, 0, 2, 0], I would keep:\n   - 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 19 = 76\n   - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273\n   - 7 units of item 3 = 7 \u00d7 18 = 126\n   - 4 units of item 4 = 4 \u00d7 29 = 116\n   - 6 units of item 5 = 6 \u00d7 58 = 348\n   Total value to me: 939\n   With discount factor: 939 \u00d7 0.9 = 845.1\n   \n   This is still substantially better than my outside offer of 601.\n\n4) Decision:\n   Player 2's current offer is extremely favorable to me (worth 888.3 vs. my outside offer of 601). If I accept now, I secure this value.\n   \n   If I counteroffer with [2, 0, 0, 2, 0], I would get slightly less (845.1) if accepted, but might risk Player 2 walking away.\n   \n   Given that Player 2's offer is already very generous and we're in round 2 (with the discount factor already applied), accepting is the rational choice.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

My values for these items are 51, 4, 25, 49, and 26. My outside offer is 115.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the value of the current offer to me:\n* Item 1: 3 units * 51 = 153\n* Item 2: 1 unit * 4 = 4\n* Item 3: 2 units * 25 = 50\n* Item 4: 0 units * 49 = 0\n* Item 5: 3 units * 26 = 78\nTotal value of the offer: 153 + 4 + 50 + 0 + 78 = 285\n\nSince 285 is greater than my outside offer of 115, accepting the offer is better than walking away *now*. However, this is only round 1, and I could potentially get a better deal by making a counteroffer. The discount factor is 0.9, so walking away next round would give me 115 * 0.9 = 103.5.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer. I want to maximize my value, so I should try to give Player 1 items that I value less and keep items that I value more.\n\nMy values are:\n* Item 1: 51\n* Item 2: 4\n* Item 3: 25\n* Item 4: 49\n* Item 5: 26\n\nThe total units available are 6, 4, 2, 3, 7.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 4, 0, 2, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    49 x 1 + 79 x 4 + 19 x 0 + 87 x 2 + 61 x 4\n    which is 783 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 784. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Since this is the last round where I can make a meaningful offer (i.e. an offer that *can* be accepted), it might be better to just accept.\n\nTherefore, I will accept the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 604. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 604. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 735 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 4, 5, 1, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    49 x 2 + 25 x 4 + 3 x 5 + 94 x 1 + 74 x 4\n    which is 603 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 604. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

Let's adjust again:\n\n- Item 1: 0 units (keeping 4 units for myself = 196)\n- Item 2: 3 units (keeping 4 units for myself = 100)\n- Item 3: 5 units (keeping 1 unit for myself = 3)\n- Item 4: 0 units (keeping 1 unit for myself = 94)\n- Item 5: 0 units (keeping 4 units for myself = 296)\n\nValue for me: 196 + 100 + 3 + 94 + 296 = 689\n\nThis is greater than my outside offer (604).\n\n## Step 3: Make a decision\n\nThe offer I'm proposing:\n- I keep: 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 4 units of item 5\n- I offer to Player 2: 0 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5\n\nThis gives me a value of 689, which is better than my outside offer of 604.\n\nSince I'm offering Player 2 the low-value items (from my perspective) and keeping the high-value ones, there's a chance Player 2 might actually value these items differently and find this acceptable.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 5, 0, 0]}",

I should try to keep most of my high-value items (1, 3, and 5) while offering more of my low-value items (especially item 4).\n\nLet me consider this potential offer to Player 2:\n- Item 1: 1 unit (keep 3)\n- Item 2: 2 units (keep 2)\n- Item 3: 1 unit (keep 4)\n- Item 4: 10 units (keep 2)\n- Item 5: 1 unit (keep 4)\n\nValue to me of what I keep:\n- 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (item 1)\n- 2 \u00d7 41 = 82 (item 2)\n- 4 \u00d7 98 = 392 (item 3)\n- 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 (item 4)\n- 4 \u00d7 82 = 328 (item 5)\n- Total: 1099\n\nThis is greater than my outside offer of 858, so it's a viable offer.\n\n## 3) Making a decision:\n\nSince I'm starting the negotiation, I want to make a strong initial offer that favors me while still appearing reasonable. I'll give up most of my lowest-value item (item 4) and keep most of my highest-value items (1, 3, and 5).\n\nThe offer I analyzed above gives me a value of 1099, which is significantly better than my outside offer of 858. It allows me to keep most of my high-value items while giving Player 2 a reasonable amount of each item type.\n\nTherefore, I'll make a counteroffer to Player 2, giving them [1, 2, 1, 10, 1] while keeping [3, 2, 4, 2, 4] for myself.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 1, 10, 1]}",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 3, 10, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    97 x 0 + 41 x 3 + 98 x 3 + 3 x 10 + 82 x 5\n    which is 857 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 858. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 1, 10, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [4, 4, 0, 7, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [4, 4, 0, 7, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

If Player 1 offered [0, 2, 1, 10, 2] that means they are keeping [4, 2, 4, 2, 3] for themselves.\nIf I give them [4, 2, 4, 2, 3], this would mean that the total units given add up to the available units for each item.\nThe only issue is that my counter offer would be treated as a WALK if this is the last round.\n\nSince accepting the offer is better than walking away immediately, and this is Round 2, let's start by proposing to increase my take, and see how player 1 responds.\nLet's try offering player 1 [1, 1, 1, 1, 1].\nThis gives me [3, 3, 4, 11, 4] which is:\n3 * 26 + 3 * 27 + 4 * 56 + 11 * 43 + 4 * 94 = 78 + 81 + 224 + 473 + 376 = 1232\nDiscounted value: 1232 * 0.9 = 1108.8\n\nThis looks like a better strategy than accepting immediately, and the last thing that I want to do is walk away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 858. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 858. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 963 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 3, 10, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    97 x 0 + 41 x 3 + 98 x 3 + 3 x 10 + 82 x 5\n    which is 857 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 858. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 1, 10, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [4, 4, 0, 7, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 1, 10, 2]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "I need to carefully analyze the current situation and make the best decision for the final round of negotiation.\n\n## 1) Analyzing the Current Situation\n\n- My outside offer value: 858\n- My item values: Item 1 (97), Item 2 (41), Item 3 (98), Item 4 (3), Item 5 (82)\n- Total pool of items: 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 12 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5\n- Discount factor: Since this is round 3, any deal will be discounted by \u03b3\u00b2 = 0.9\u00b2 = 0.81\n\n## 2) Assessing Value of Offers\n\n**Current offer on the table:**\nPlayer 2 is offering me [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], meaning I would keep [3, 3, 4, 11, 4].\n\nLet's calculate the value:\n- 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291\n- 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123\n- 4 units of item 3 = 4 \u00d7 98 = 392\n- 11 units of item 4 = 11 \u00d7 3 = 33\n- 4 units of item 5 = 4 \u00d7 82 = 328\n- Total value = 1167\n\nWith discount factor (round 3): 1167 \u00d7 0.81 = 945.27\n\n**My last offer:**\nI offered [0, 2, 1, 10, 2], keeping [4, 2, 4, 2, 3] for myself.\n- 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 97 = 388\n- 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 41 = 82\n- 4 units of item 3 = 4 \u00d7 98 = 392\n- 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 3 = 6\n- 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246\n- Total value = 1114\n\nWith discount: 1114 \u00d7 0.81 = 902.34\n\n**Player 2's negotiation pattern:**\n- First offered [4, 4, 0, 7, 2] - keeping all of item 3, half of item 4, and most of item 5\n- Second offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] - a much more balanced offer\n\nThis suggests Player 2 highly values item 3 and item 5, and possibly realized they needed to make a more reasonable offer in the final round.\n\n## 3) Decision Making\n\nThe current offer gives me a value of 945.27 after discount, which is higher than my outside offer of 858. Since this is the final round and any counteroffer from me would be the last move, I need to carefully consider my options.\n\nIf I make a counteroffer, Player 2 can only accept or walk away. If they walk away, I get my outside offer of 858. I need to ensure any counteroffer I make is better for me than the current offer while still being acceptable to Player 2.\n\nGiven that the current offer is already quite good (945.27 > 858) and we're in the final round, the safer option is to accept this offer. Making a counteroffer risks Player 2 walking away, which would leave me with just my outside offer.\n\nFurthermore, Player 2's current offer seems to be a compromise compared to their previous offer, showing willingness to reach an agreement. If I push too hard now, they might walk away.\n\nTherefore, the best action is to ACCEPT the current offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the current offer and decide on the best action.\n\nThe current offer from Player 1 is [0, 3, 0, 2, 2]. This means they are offering me 0 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.  I need to calculate the value of this offer to me.\n\nMy private values are: 23 for item 1, 16 for item 2, 70 for item 3, 13 for item 4, 49 for item 5.\n\nValue of the offer:\n- Item 1: 0 * 23 = 0\n- Item 2: 3 * 16 = 48\n- Item 3: 0 * 70 = 0\n- Item 4: 2 * 13 = 26\n- Item 5: 2 * 49 = 98\nTotal value = 0 + 48 + 0 + 26 + 98 = 172\n\nMy outside offer is 257. Since the current offer (172) is less than my outside offer (257), accepting is not a good choice. I should either walk away or make a counteroffer. Let's consider a counteroffer.\n\nI have the following quantities of each item: 6 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5.\n\nI want to maximize my value, so I want to keep items with high value for myself (item 3 and item 5) and give away items with lower value (item 1 and item 4). Item 2 is in the middle.\n\nLet's construct an offer that gives Player 1 almost everything except for enough items to match or beat my outside option and still leaves them enough to accept:\n\n*   Item 1: Offer Player 1 5 units, keep 1. (Value to me: 1 * 23 = 23)\n*   Item 2: Offer Player 1 0 units, keep 3. (Value to me: 3 * 16 = 48)\n*   Item 3: Offer Player 1 0 units, keep 2. (Value to me: 2 * 70 = 140)\n*   Item 4: Offer Player 1 4 units, keep 1. (Value to me: 1 * 13 = 13)\n*   Item 5: Offer Player 1 0 units, keep 4. (Value to me: 4 * 49 = 196)\nTotal value to me = 23 + 48 + 140 + 13 + 196 = 420\n\nNow, let's check if there's an alternative counteroffer that might be even better, given that it's round 1. My goal is to obtain at least my outside option, 257, adjusted by the discount factor in the next rounds.\n\nThe counteroffer would be [5, 0, 0, 4, 0] for Player 1. This means that I'm asking them to give me the items of higher value, which they might not accept.\n\nAnother option is to make an offer that gets me closer to my ideal, but is still enticing for player 1.\n\nI am giving player 1:\n\n*   Item 1: 6\n*   Item 2: 0\n*   Item 3: 0\n*   Item 4: 5\n*   Item 5: 0\n\nValue: 0+48+140+13+196 = 497\n\nMy value if I give player 1:\nItem 1: 6\nItem 2: 3\nItem 3: 2\nItem 4: 5\nItem 5: 4\nIf player 1 value more of item 1 and 4 it might be attractive for them to accept this.\n\nGiven the risk and the uncertainty, I will offer a counteroffer to player 1.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [6, 0, 0, 5, 0]}\n```",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 23. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 23. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 879 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    96 x 0 + 15 x 1 + 63 x 0 + 60 x 0 + 59 x 0\n    which is 15 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 23. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 3, 0, 2, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [6, 0, 0, 5, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [6, 0, 0, 5, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "I'll analyze this situation step by step to determine my best action.\n\n## 1) Current Situation Analysis\n\n- My outside offer value: 23\n- My item values: \n  - Item 1: 96 per unit\n  - Item 2: 15 per unit\n  - Item 3: 63 per unit\n  - Item 4: 60 per unit\n  - Item 5: 59 per unit\n- Total pool: 6 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5\n- Discount factor: gamma = 0.9 (currently in round 2, so any deal now will be multiplied by 0.9)\n- Round: We are in round 2 (of 3)\n\n## 2) Value of Current Offer\n\nPlayer 2 offered me [6, 0, 0, 5, 0], meaning I would get:\n- 6 units of item 1 = 6 \u00d7 96 = 576\n- 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 15 = 0\n- 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 63 = 0\n- 5 units of item 4 = 5 \u00d7 60 = 300\n- 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 59 = 0\n\nTotal value = 876\nDiscounted value (in round 2) = 876 \u00d7 0.9 = 788.4\n\nThis is significantly higher than my outside offer of 23.\n\n## 3) Analyzing Player 2's Behavior\n\nPlayer 2's offer gives me all of items 1 and 4, keeping all of items 2, 3, and 5 for themselves. This suggests:\n- Player 2 values items 2, 3, and 5 highly\n- Player 2 values items 1 and 4 less\n\nMy initial offer was [0, 3, 0, 2, 2], which Player 2 rejected. This means they want to keep some of items 3 and 5 that I was trying to keep for myself.\n\n## 4) Decision Making\n\nThe current offer on the table is extremely favorable to me. I'm getting the items I value most highly (item 1 at 96 per unit and item 4 at 60 per unit).\n\nIf I accept:\n- I get a discounted value of 788.4, which is far above my outside offer of 23\n\nIf I counteroffer:\n- There's a risk Player 2 might walk away in the final round\n- I'm already getting high-value items (1 and 4)\n- I might try to get some units of item 3 (value 63) or item 5 (value 59)\n\nPotential counteroffer calculation:\nIf I try to also get item 3 while giving up some of item 4, such as [6, 0, 0, 3, 0]:\n- 6 units of item 1 = 6 \u00d7 96 = 576\n- 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 15 = 0\n- 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 63 = 126\n- 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 60 = 180\n- 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 59 = 0\n\nTotal = 882, which is only slightly better than the current offer, and when factoring in the risk of Player 2 walking away, it's not worth it.\n\n## 5) Conclusion\n\nThe current offer is highly favorable to me, giving me the items I value most. The value (788.4 after discount) is much higher than my outside offer (23). There's little benefit in counteroffering and risking the deal, especially since we're already in round 2.\n\nTherefore, I will accept the current offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 3, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    36 x 0 + 50 x 0 + 71 x 3 + 3 x 0 + 61 x 0\n    which is 213 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 214. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 3, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    36 x 0 + 50 x 0 + 71 x 3 + 3 x 0 + 61 x 0\n    which is 213 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 214. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 4, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 4, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 4, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "I need to carefully analyze this negotiation to make the best decision. Let's walk through it step by step.\n\n1) Current situation:\n   - My outside offer value: 214\n   - My private values: 36 (item 1), 50 (item 2), 71 (item 3), 3 (item 4), 61 (item 5)\n   - Total pool: 3 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5\n   - We're in round 2, so discount factor would be 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9 if we conclude this round\n\n2) Evaluating the current offer from Player 2:\n   Player 2 is offering me [0, 0, 0, 4, 0], meaning I'd keep:\n   - 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 36 = 108\n   - 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 50 = 50\n   - 3 units of item 3: 3 \u00d7 71 = 213\n   - 0 units of item 4: 0 \u00d7 3 = 0\n   - 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 61 = 122\n   Total value: 108 + 50 + 213 + 0 + 122 = 493\n   With discount factor: 493 \u00d7 0.9 = 443.7\n\n3) Comparing to my outside offer:\n   My outside offer is 214, which is significantly less than the 443.7 I'd get by accepting.\n\n4) Analyzing Player 2's behavior:\n   - In round 1, I offered [1, 0, 0, 4, 0] to Player 2\n   - Player 2 countered with [0, 0, 0, 4, 0]\n   - This suggests Player 2 might value items 1, 2, 3, and 5 more, since they countered to get all of these except item 4\n   - Player 2 seems especially uninterested in item 4 (offered me all 4 units)\n\n5) Decision making:\n   The current offer is very favorable to me. I'd keep all high-value items (especially item 3 which is my highest at 71 per unit) and only give up item 4 which is my lowest value (3 per unit).\n\nThe value I'd get by accepting (443.7) is much higher than my outside offer (214). If I try to counter, I risk Player 2 walking away in the final round, and the discount factor will further reduce value.\n\nSince the current offer is extremely favorable to me (I get all high-value items and only give up my lowest-value item), and the value far exceeds my outside offer, I should accept this offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

Let's try offering:\nItem 1: 0\nItem 2: 0\nItem 3: 0\nItem 4: 1\nItem 5: 1\n\nThis leaves me with:\nItem 1: 5\nItem 2: 2\nItem 3: 5\nItem 4: 5\nItem 5: 5\n\nMy value becomes:\n(5 * 51) + (2 * 7) + (5 * 69) + (5 * 100) + (5 * 22) = 255 + 14 + 345 + 500 + 110 = 1224\n\nEven more under. It's clear I need almost all the items. Let's offer only small amounts of the high value items.\n\nItem 1: 1\nItem 2: 1\nItem 3: 1\nItem 4: 0\nItem 5: 0\n\nThis leaves me with:\nItem 1: 4\nItem 2: 1\nItem 3: 4\nItem 4: 6\nItem 5: 6\n\nMy value becomes:\n(4 * 51) + (1 * 7) + (4 * 69) + (6 * 100) + (6 * 22) = 204 + 7 + 276 + 600 + 132 = 1219\n\nI'll offer:\nItem 1: 0\nItem 2: 0\nItem 3: 0\nItem 4: 0\nItem 5: 0\n\nThis leaves me with:\nItem 1: 5\nItem 2: 2\nItem 3: 5\nItem 4: 6\nItem 5: 6\n\nMy value then becomes:\n(5 * 51) + (2 * 7) + (5 * 69) + (6 * 100) + (6 * 22) = 255 + 14 + 345 + 600 + 132 = 1346\n\nOkay, this is just above my outside offer. It is a risk though.\n\nI think it's best to try and be greedy.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 587. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 587. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1188 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 5, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    91 x 0 + 55 x 0 + 67 x 1 + 84 x 5 + 99 x 1\n    which is 586 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 587. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 4, 2, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "I need to analyze the current situation and determine my best action.\n\n## Step 1: Analyze the current situation\n\n- My outside offer value: 587\n- My item values:\n  - Item 1: 91 per unit (5 units total)\n  - Item 2: 55 per unit (2 units total)\n  - Item 3: 67 per unit (5 units total)\n  - Item 4: 84 per unit (6 units total)\n  - Item 5: 99 per unit (6 units total)\n- Total pool: 5 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5\n- Discount factor: 0.9 (we're in round 2, so any deal made now will be worth 0.9\u00d7 its nominal value)\n\n## Step 2: Assess offers\n\nCurrent offer from Player 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nThis means Player 2 is offering me nothing and wants everything for themselves.\n\nMy previous offer was [1, 2, 4, 2, 1], which means I offered Player 2:\n- 1 unit of item 1\n- 2 units of item 2\n- 4 units of item 3\n- 2 units of item 4\n- 1 unit of item 5\n\nAnd I would keep:\n- 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 91 = 364\n- 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 55 = 0\n- 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 67 = 67\n- 4 units of item 4 = 4 \u00d7 84 = 336\n- 5 units of item 5 = 5 \u00d7 99 = 495\nTotal value = 1262\n\nPlayer 2's offer of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] is clearly not acceptable as it would give me a value of 0, which is far below my outside offer of 587.\n\n## Step 3: Make a decision\n\nLet me consider a new counteroffer. Based on Player 2's offer of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], they appear to be starting with an aggressive position. Their offer suggests they may be trying to claim everything.\n\nI should make a counteroffer that:\n1. Provides me with more value than my outside offer (587)\n2. Gives Player 2 some value to work with\n3. Focuses on keeping more of my high-value items (items 1, 4, and 5)\n\nLet me propose a counteroffer where I offer:\n[2, 1, 3, 1, 1]\n\nThis means I would keep:\n- 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273\n- 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 55 = 55\n- 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 67 = 134\n- 5 units of item 4 = 5 \u00d7 84 = 420\n- 5 units of item 5 = 5 \u00d7 99 = 495\nTotal value = 1377\n\nThis is significantly higher than my outside offer of 587, so it satisfies my requirements. It's also more reasonable than Player 2's current offer and moves toward a middle ground.\n\nThe value with discount factor applied would be 1377 \u00d7 0.9 = 1239.3, which is still well above my outside offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 3, 1, 1]}",

Since 817.2 < 1338, accepting the offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider a counteroffer. It's the last round I can make one.

A key point is that in the next round, if I make a counteroffer, it will be treated as a walkaway. Thus, I have to make a counteroffer that Player 1 will rationally accept in this round. This means the counteroffer will be such that their present value (discounted) is no less than their outside option.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Let me rank items by value per unit:\n1. Item 4: 93 (highest value)\n2. Item 1: 72\n3. Item 5: 52\n4. Item 2: 24\n5. Item 3: 12 (lowest value)\n\nFor a good first offer, I should keep most or all of my high-value items and offer some low-value items to Player 2.

I'm offering Player 2 some units of low-value items (to me) while keeping most of my high-value items.\n\nMy initial offer to Player 2 will be [1, 3, 2, 0, 1], meaning I'm offering:\n- 1 unit of item 1\n- 3 units of item 2\n- 2 units of item 3\n- 0 units of item 4\n- 1 unit of item 5\n\nThis ensures I avoid all five mistakes:\n- This is my first offer, so I can't make an offer worse than my previous one\n- The value I keep (1215) is better than my outside offer (792)\n- I'm not offering no items or all items\n- I'm not accepting any offers yet\n- I'm not walking away from a good offer\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 3, 2, 0, 1]}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 2, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 3, 2, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and decide on the best action.\n\nThe current offer on the table is [1, 3, 2, 0, 1], meaning I receive:\n- 1 unit of item 1\n- 3 units of item 2\n- 2 units of item 3\n- 0 units of item 4\n- 1 unit of item 5\n\nMy private values are:\n- Item 1: 55\n- Item 2: 56\n- Item 3: 19\n- Item 4: 29\n- Item 5: 12\n\nSo, the value of the current offer to me is:\n(1 * 55) + (3 * 56) + (2 * 19) + (0 * 29) + (1 * 12) = 55 + 168 + 38 + 0 + 12 = 273\n\nMy outside offer is 506. Since the value of the current offer (273) is significantly lower than my outside offer (506), accepting is not a good option.\n\nI need to decide whether to walk away or make a counteroffer. Let's consider a counteroffer that gives Player 1 all the items. This gives me a value of 0. Even with the discount factor of 0.9 applied over 2 more rounds, it will never beat my outside offer, so this would be useless.\n\nLet's consider what offer I should make to get the best possible outcome if the deal occurs on round 2. Since I want to maximize my value, I should consider offering Player 1 the minimum possible value. Let's try to make the counter offer as close to Player 1's value as possible.\nGiven that the negotiation will proceed to round 2, I should divide the values of outside offer by the discount factor of 0.9. This gives 506/0.9 = 562.22\nThen, to beat the outside offer, I should make a counter offer such that my value is higher than 562.22.\nNow, let's assume I keep all the items:\n6 units of item 1 = 6 * 55 = 330\n5 units of item 2 = 5 * 56 = 280\n2 units of item 3 = 2 * 19 = 38\n7 units of item 4 = 7 * 29 = 203\n4 units of item 5 = 4 * 12 = 48\nTotal value = 330 + 280 + 38 + 203 + 48 = 899\n\nIf I offer player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], my value will be 899 > 562.22. I should consider making a counteroffer. If I offer player 1 [0,0,0,0,0], I will be asking them to ACCEPT an offer that is worth 0 for them. They will certainly walk.\nI have 6 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 7 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5.\nGiven that my values are 55, 56, 19, 29, 12 and the offer is 1, 3, 2, 0, 1, let's consider giving them the current amount back.\nCounter offer: [5, 2, 0, 7, 3]\nMy value: (1*55) + (3*56) + (2*19) + (0*29) + (1*12) = 55 + 168 + 38 + 0 + 12 = 273\nDiscounted value: 273*0.9 = 245.7, which is less than outside offer. So this isn't useful.\n\nGiven all the options, I think walking away is the best option because the current offer is low and I'm not sure that I can come up with a counter offer that Player 1 will accept, such that it gives me a better value than my outside offer * discounted value.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [6, 3, 2, 2, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    94 x 6 + 64 x 3 + 38 x 2 + 77 x 2 + 24 x 4\n    which is 1082 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1084. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 6, 0, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    91 x 2 + 83 x 0 + 33 x 6 + 78 x 0 + 73 x 3\n    which is 599 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 600. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 1, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    62 x 0 + 36 x 2 + 24 x 1 + 52 x 2 + 52 x 2\n    which is 304 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 306. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

Item 1: 62 (highest value)\n2. Item 4/5: 52 (tied)\n3. Item 2: 36\n4.

It's the minimum I should accept.\n\nLet me adjust slightly to give a slightly better offer while still maintaining a good value:\n- Item 1: 0 units (keep all)\n- Item 2: 2 units (give half)\n- Item 3: 3 units (give all)\n- Item 4: 0 units (keep all)\n- Item 5: 1 unit (give half)\n\nValue assessment if I keep [1,2,0,2,1]:\n- Item 1: 1 unit \u00d7 62 = 62\n- Item 2: 2 units \u00d7 36 = 72\n- Item 3: 0 units \u00d7 24 = 0\n- Item 4: 2 units \u00d7 52 = 104\n- Item 5: 1 unit \u00d7 52 = 52\nTotal: 290\n\nThis is below my outside offer. Let me try once more:\n\n- Item 1: 0 units (keep all)\n- Item 2: 2 units (give half)\n- Item 3: 2 units (give most but not all)\n- Item 4: 0 units (keep all)\n- Item 5: 0 units (keep all)\n\nValue assessment if I keep [1,2,1,2,2]:\n- Item 1: 1 unit \u00d7 62 = 62\n- Item 2: 2 units \u00d7 36 = 72\n- Item 3: 1 unit \u00d7 24 = 24\n- Item 4: 2 units \u00d7 52 = 104\n- Item 5: 2 units \u00d7 52 = 104\nTotal: 366\n\nThis is well above my outside offer of 306, so it's a reasonable offer.\n\n## 3) Decision:\n\nBased on the analysis, I'll propose giving Player 2:\n- 0 units of item 1\n- 2 units of item 2\n- 2 units of item 3\n- 0 units of item 4\n- 0 units of item 5\n\nThis keeps a value of 366 for me, which is better than my outside offer of 306, while giving some items to Player 2.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the current offer and determine the best course of action.\n\nThe current offer gives me:\n- Item 1: 1 - 0 = 1 unit\n- Item 2: 4 - 2 = 2 units\n- Item 3: 3 - 2 = 1 unit\n- Item 4: 2 - 0 = 2 units\n- Item 5: 2 - 0 = 2 units\n\nMy values for these items are:\n- Item 1: 69\n- Item 2: 98\n- Item 3: 56\n- Item 4: 15\n- Item 5: 64\n\nSo the total value of the current offer to me is:\n(1 * 69) + (2 * 98) + (1 * 56) + (2 * 15) + (2 * 64) = 69 + 196 + 56 + 30 + 128 = 479\n\nThis value (479) is less than my outside offer of 629. Therefore, accepting the offer is not in my best interest.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. To do this effectively, I need to consider what Player 1 might value. However, I don't know their values. A reasonable starting point is to offer a split that gives me a value close to my outside offer, while leaving Player 1 with some value as well. If I can't find such a split, walking away might be the best option.\n\nI'm going to start with a conservative offer. Let's try offering Player 1 half of each item, rounded up or down as necessary to ensure whole numbers and that I retain at least enough to exceed my outside offer when possible.\n- Item 1: Offer 0 to Player 1, I keep 1\n- Item 2: Offer 2 to Player 1, I keep 2\n- Item 3: Offer 1 to Player 1, I keep 2\n- Item 4: Offer 1 to Player 1, I keep 1\n- Item 5: Offer 1 to Player 1, I keep 1\n\nThis gives me:\n- 1 * 69 + 2 * 98 + 2 * 56 + 1 * 15 + 1 * 64 = 69 + 196 + 112 + 15 + 64 = 456\n\nThis is still less than my outside offer value of 629. So this won't work.\nLet's calculate the value of the current offer to Player 1 if I accept it:\n\nPlayer 1 gets:\nItem 1: 0\nItem 2: 2\nItem 3: 2\nItem 4: 0\nItem 5: 0\nI don't know Player 1's values, so I can't calculate the value of that to them.\n\nGiven that I don't know Player 1's values, and I am in Round 1, I should make a counteroffer that aims for a more favorable split for myself. Let's target a value slightly above my outside offer, allowing for negotiation. If they reject this, I can always walk away in the next round if needed.\n\nLet's try offering:\nItem 1: 0\nItem 2: 1\nItem 3: 1\nItem 4: 0\nItem 5: 0\n\nThis gives me:\nItem 1: 1\nItem 2: 3\nItem 3: 2\nItem 4: 2\nItem 5: 2\n\nValue to me: (1*69) + (3*98) + (2*56) + (2*15) + (2*64) = 69 + 294 + 112 + 30 + 128 = 633\n\nThis exceeds my outside offer.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 422. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 804 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 5, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    34 x 0 + 96 x 0 + 48 x 5 + 74 x 2 + 16 x 2\n    which is 420 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 422. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 1, 4, 6, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    67 x 2 + 22 x 1 + 92 x 4 + 14 x 6 + 35 x 2\n    which is 678 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 679. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 1, 4, 6, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    67 x 2 + 22 x 1 + 92 x 4 + 14 x 6 + 35 x 2\n    which is 678 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 679. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 0, 5, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "I need to analyze the current situation and decide whether to accept, walk away, or make a counteroffer.\n\n## 1) Current Situation Analysis:\n\n- My outside offer value: 679\n- My item values:\n  * Item 1: 67 per unit (6 units total)\n  * Item 2: 22 per unit (4 units total)\n  * Item 3: 92 per unit (4 units total)\n  * Item 4: 14 per unit (7 units total)\n  * Item 5: 35 per unit (3 units total)\n- Total items: 6 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 7 of item 4, 3 of item 5\n- Discount factor: 0.9 (current round is 2, so discount = 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9)\n\n## 2) Value Assessment:\n\nCurrent offer from Player 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] \nThis means Player 2 is offering me nothing and keeping everything for themselves. This is clearly unacceptable.\n\nMy previous offer to Player 2: [1, 2, 0, 5, 1]\nThis means I would keep: [5, 2, 4, 2, 2]\n\nValue of my previous offer (what I keep):\n- 5 units of item 1: 5 \u00d7 67 = 335\n- 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 22 = 44\n- 4 units of item 3: 4 \u00d7 92 = 368\n- 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 14 = 28\n- 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 35 = 70\nTotal value = 845\n\nPlayer 2's counteroffer of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] is aggressive, suggesting they want everything. I should respond with a strong counteroffer that gives me good value while being potentially acceptable to them.\n\n## 3) Decision Making:\n\nLet me consider a new counteroffer. Looking at my values, items 1 and 3 are my highest value items (67 and 92 respectively), so I want to keep most of these. Items 2 and 4 are my lowest value (22 and 14), so I can offer more of these.\n\nProposed counteroffer (what I give to Player 2): [1, 3, 0, 6, 1]\nThis means I would keep: [5, 1, 4, 1, 2]\n\nValue calculation for my proposed offer:\n- 5 units of item 1: 5 \u00d7 67 = 335\n- 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 22 = 22\n- 4 units of item 3: 4 \u00d7 92 = 368\n- 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 14 = 14\n- 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 35 = 70\nTotal value = 809\n\nWith the discount factor of 0.9 for this round, the value of this offer would be: 809 \u00d7 0.9 = 728.1\n\nThis is significantly better than my outside offer of 679, so it's a reasonable offer to make.\n\nThe offer is also somewhat more generous to Player 2 than my previous offer, which might increase the chances of acceptance while still preserving good value for me.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 3, 0, 6, 1]}",
