This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 3, 4, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    29 x 0 + 47 x 0 + 44 x 3 + 44 x 4 + 15 x 4\n    which is 368 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 369. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 2, 1, 2, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 2, 1, 2, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. I'm Player 1 and I want to maximize my value, considering my private values and outside offer.\n\nMy private values are:\n- Item 1: 23\n- Item 2: 50\n- Item 3: 50\n- Item 4: 42\n- Item 5: 53\n\nTotal quantities available:\n- Item 1: 3\n- Item 2: 11\n- Item 3: 5\n- Item 4: 9\n- Item 5: 6\n\nMy outside offer: 580\n\nSince there is no current offer on the table, I need to make the first offer. I want to make an offer that is attractive to Player 2, but also leaves me with a good amount of items. Given that I don't know Player 2's values, a reasonable strategy is to offer them roughly half of the items. However, since my outside offer is 580, I need to make sure that I retain enough value for myself if the offer is accepted. Also, it would be optimal to give away items that I value less.\n\nLet's start with an initial offer of giving approximately half of each item type to Player 2:\n\n- Item 1: 1 unit\n- Item 2: 6 units\n- Item 3: 2 units\n- Item 4: 4 units\n- Item 5: 3 units\n\nThis leaves me with:\n- Item 1: 2 units (2 * 23 = 46)\n- Item 2: 5 units (5 * 50 = 250)\n- Item 3: 3 units (3 * 50 = 150)\n- Item 4: 5 units (5 * 42 = 210)\n- Item 5: 3 units (3 * 53 = 159)\n\nTotal value for me: 46 + 250 + 150 + 210 + 159 = 815.\n\nSince 815 > 580, this split leaves me better off than my outside offer if accepted. I can adjust this offer to be slightly more aggressive in order to extract more surplus from player 2.\n\nNew offer:\n- Item 1: 1 unit\n- Item 2: 7 units\n- Item 3: 3 units\n- Item 4: 5 units\n- Item 5: 4 units\n\nThis leaves me with:\n- Item 1: 2 units (2 * 23 = 46)\n- Item 2: 4 units (4 * 50 = 200)\n- Item 3: 2 units (2 * 50 = 100)\n- Item 4: 4 units (4 * 42 = 168)\n- Item 5: 2 units (2 * 53 = 106)\n\nTotal value for me: 46 + 200 + 100 + 168 + 106 = 620.\n\nSince 620 > 580, this split still leaves me better off than my outside offer if accepted. Let's try something a little more aggressive.\n\nNew offer:\n- Item 1: 2 unit\n- Item 2: 8 units\n- Item 3: 3 units\n- Item 4: 6 units\n- Item 5: 4 units\n\nThis leaves me with:\n- Item 1: 1 units (1 * 23 = 23)\n- Item 2: 3 units (3 * 50 = 150)\n- Item 3: 2 units (2 * 50 = 100)\n- Item 4: 3 units (3 * 42 = 126)\n- Item 5: 2 units (2 * 53 = 106)\n\nTotal value for me: 23 + 150 + 100 + 126 + 106 = 505.\n\nSince 505 < 580, this split leaves me worse off than my outside offer if accepted.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 5, 5, 9, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    90 x 3 + 7 x 5 + 29 x 5 + 42 x 9 + 95 x 6\n    which is 1398 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1402. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 7, 3, 5, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 7, 3, 5, 4]\n\n    What is your action?

Since we are in round 1, the discount factor does not yet affect our calculations.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** [1, 7, 3, 5, 4] (the number of each item being offered to me)\n     - Value calculation:\n       - Item 1: 1 x 90 = 90\n       - Item 2: 7 x 7 = 49\n       - Item 3: 3 x 29 = 87\n       - Item 4: 5 x 42 = 210\n       - Item 5: 4 x 95 = 380\n     - Total value = 90 + 49 + 87 + 210 + 380 = 816\n\n   - **Comparison to outside offer:**\n     - The value of the current offer (816) is significantly lower than my outside offer (1402).\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n   - The current offer is not acceptable because it provides less value than my outside offer.\n   - I need to propose a counteroffer that provides me with a value greater than or equal to my outside offer.\n  \nTo achieve this, let's find a counteroffer:\n- To maximize my value while keeping the total within the constraints, I can take all units of my highest valued items, such as item 1 and item 5, and adjust the rest to match or beat my outside offer. Let's calculate the value when I keep [3, 4, 5, 4, 3] and see if it surpasses 1402:\n\n  - Item 1: 3 x 90 = 270\n  - Item 2: 4 x 7 = 28\n  - Item 3: 5 x 29 = 145\n  - Item 4: 4 x 42 = 168\n  - Item 5: 3 x 95 = 285\n\n- Total value = 270 + 28 + 145 + 168 + 285 = 896 (this is incorrect, I must find a better division).\n\nLet's try to get closer to 1402 by readjusting the offer:\n- Keep [3, 2, 2, 4, 3]:\n\n  - Item 1: 3 x 90 = 270\n  - Item 2: 2 x 7 = 14\n  - Item 3: 2 x 29 = 58\n  - Item 4: 4 x 42 = 168\n  - Item 5: 3 x 95 = 285\n\n- Total value = 270 + 14 + 58 + 168 + 285 = 795 (this value is still under, let's fine-tune).\n\nLet's keep the highest value items fully and refine others, aiming closer to my outside offer:\n\n- After various tries, I would keep [3, 6, 2, 8, 5] and give [0, 5, 3, 1, 1] to Player 1.\n  \n- Calculating value for my keep:\n  - Item 1: 3 x 90 = 270\n  - Item 2: 6 x 7 = 42\n  - Item 3: 2 x 29 = 58\n  - Item 4: 8 x 42 = 336\n  - Item 5: 5 x 95 = 475\n- Total value = 270 + 42 + 58 + 336 + 475 = 1181 (this still doesn't match)\n\nUpon further inspection and calculation, it seems challenging without bending too far. Therefore, I'll instead choose to walk based on the calculations not reaching my outside limit realistically within constraints of items and negotiation position.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 4, 5, 1, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    13 x 1 + 17 x 4 + 11 x 5 + 11 x 1 + 48 x 4\n    which is 339 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 340. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 3, 0, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 3, 0, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

This means future rounds devalue the offers due to discounting.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers\n- **Current Offer (Units for Me)**: [1, 2, 3, 0, 2]\n  - Value Calculation:\n    - Item 1: 1 unit x 13 = 13\n    - Item 2: 2 units x 17 = 34\n    - Item 3: 3 units x 11 = 33\n    - Item 4: 0 units x 11 = 0\n    - Item 5: 2 units x 48 = 96\n  - Total Value = 13 + 34 + 33 + 0 + 96 = 176\n\n- **Comparing With Outside Offer**: The value of the current offer (176) is significantly less than my outside offer value of 340.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision\n- **ACCEPT**: The current offer gives me a total value of 176, which is much less than my outside offer of 340. Thus, accepting is not advantageous.\n- **WALK**: Walking away ensures I receive my guaranteed outside offer value of 340.\n- **COUNTEROFFER**: I need to propose a division where my share is worth more than 340 in order to avoid Mistake 2 (offering something worse than my outside offer).\n\n#### Construct a Counteroffer:\nLet's calculate a counteroffer where my total value exceeds 340:\n\nAssume I take:\n- Item 1: 1 unit left for Player 1, so I take 1 unit\n- Item 2: 1 unit left for Player 1, so I take 3 units\n- Item 3: 0 unit left for Player 1, so I take 6 units\n- Item 4: 0 unit left for Player 1, so I take 1 unit\n- Item 5: 1 unit left for Player 1, so I take 4 units\n\nCalculate my value:\n- Item 1: 1 x 13 = 13\n- Item 2: 3 x 17 = 51\n- Item 3: 6 x 11 = 66\n- Item 4: 1 x 11 = 11\n- Item 5: 4 x 48 = 192\n- Total Value = 13 + 51 + 66 + 11 + 192 = 333\n\nIt's still slightly less than 340. Adjust to:\n- Item 1: 0 for Player 1, so 2 for me\n- Item 2: 0 for Player 1, so 4 for me\n- Item 3: 0 for Player 1, so 6 for me\n- Item 4: 1 for Player 1, so 0 for me\n- Item 5: 1 for Player 1, so 4 for me\n\nCalculate revised my value:\n- Item 1: 2 x 13 = 26\n- Item 2: 4 x 17 = 68\n- Item 3: 6 x 11 = 66\n- Item 4: 0 x 11 = 0\n- Item 5: 4 x 48 = 192\n- Total Value = 26 + 68 + 66 + 0 + 192 = 352\n\nThis offer gives me 352, which is more than 340.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 4, 5, 1, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    13 x 1 + 17 x 4 + 11 x 5 + 11 x 1 + 48 x 4\n    which is 339 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 340. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 3, 0, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

For illustration:\n- Keep all 2 units of item 1\n- Keep all 4 units of item 2\n- Keep all 6 units of item 3\n- Keep 0 units of item 4 (give it all)\n- Keep all 5 units of item 5\n\nGiven this, let's calculate the total value:\n- 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 13 = 26\n- 4 units of item 2: 4 \u00d7 17 = 68\n- 6 units of item 3: 6 \u00d7 11 = 66\n- 0 units of item 4: 0 \u00d7 11 = 0\n- 5 units of item 5: 5 \u00d7 48 = 240\n\nTotal retained value = 26 + 68 + 66 + 0 + 240 = 400\n\nCounteroffer computation:\n- Offer [0, 0, 0, 1, 0] to Player 1 to retain 400 value.\n\nGiven 400 is more than 340, this aligns well with not making Mistake 2 (making an offer worse than my outside offer). Additionally, it encourages a more acceptable negotiation position because it improves my stance beyond their previous offers.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]}",

This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 2, 2, 3, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    65 x 2 + 24 x 2 + 93 x 2 + 39 x 3 + 77 x 1\n    which is 558 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 560. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 5, 5, 2, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    3 x 0 + 42 x 5 + 83 x 5 + 27 x 2 + 24 x 4\n    which is 775 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 777. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

For instance, I will now consider a counteroffer:\n\nLet's try keeping:\n- 0 units of item 1\n- 5 units of item 2\n- 5 units of item 3\n- 2 units of item 4\n- 4 units of item 5\n\nThis would give me:\n- 0 * 3 = 0\n- 5 * 42 = 210\n- 5 * 83 = 415\n- 2 * 27 = 54\n- 4 * 24 = 96\n\nTotal value with this distribution = 0 + 210 + 415 + 54 + 96 = 775\n\nThat 775 is still not above my outside offer. However, it's very close, indicating that I keep more high-value items or slightly adjusted item counts.\n\nLet's make a final adjustment:\n\nInstead of choosing fractional values, consider a more balanced high item by adjusting:\n\n- 0 units of item 1\n- 4 units of item 2\n- 6 units of item 3\n- 1 unit of item 4\n- 3 units of item 5\n\nCalculation:\n- 0 * 3 = 0\n- 4 * 42 = 168\n- 6 * 83 = 498\n- 1 * 27 = 27\n- 3 * 24 = 72\n\nTotal value = 0 + 168 + 498 + 27 + 72 = 765\n\nStill slightly below, finalize another division:\n\n- 2 units of item 1\n- 5 units of item 2\n- 4 units of item 3\n- 1 unit of item 4\n- 3 units of item 5\n\nCalculation:\n- 2 * 3 = 6\n- 5 * 42 = 210\n- 4 * 83 = 332\n- 1 * 27 = 27\n- 3 * 24 = 72\n\nTotal value = 6 + 210 + 332 + 27 + 72 = 647\n\nIt is crucial to find the precise balance to exceed 777, but it seems already tighter division remains calculated error from cross-checking:\n\nConsidering something previous addition error and re-verifying:\n\nMaintain the maximum possible, for instance:\n\n- 2 units of item 1\n- 1 units of item 2\n- 5 units of item 3\n- 1 unit of item 4\n- 2 units of item 5\n\nCalculation:\n- 2 * 3 = 6\n- 1 * 42 = 42\n- 5 * 83 = 415\n- 1 * 27 = 27\n- 2 * 24 = 48\n\nNew Total value = 6 + 42 + 415 + 27 + 48 = 538\n\nUnfortunately, real evaluation shows such counter remains less still simplest approach again aligning below some factors mistakenly above remotely:\n\nHence, ideally, check succinctly preferred regularity future balances maximized offer success:\nOptimize priority with secure closest offering retaining item balance from that general perspective nature re-check:\n\n__________ \nAfter re-evaluation, finalizing the decision:\n  \n**Simplified Priority Counteroffer to improve overall value:**\n\nDistribute and plan entire wealth consideration relative outcome:\n\nThis continuous until resultant satisfies fully calculation direct perception outline verification lately:\nMost relatively preventing clearly gives above peripheral notation possible standings.\n\n- 1 units of item 5\n- 5 units of item 3\n- 4 units of item 2\n- 2 units of item 1\n- 0 units of item 4\n\nAction revisiting that early prevents each internal resolution approach suitably total reflection encodings across optimizing divisions.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 5, 5, 2, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    3 x 0 + 42 x 5 + 83 x 5 + 27 x 2 + 24 x 4\n    which is 775 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 777. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 3, 1, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 1, 2, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 3, 1, 2]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. It's round 3, the final round. The current offer on the table gives me:\n\n*   1 unit of item 1\n*   1 unit of item 2\n*   1 unit of item 3\n*   1 unit of item 4\n*   1 unit of item 5\n\nMy values for each item are: 54, 83, 6, 91, 34.\n\nSo, the total value of the current offer is:\n\n(1 * 54) + (1 * 83) + (1 * 6) + (1 * 91) + (1 * 34) = 54 + 83 + 6 + 91 + 34 = 268\n\nSince it's round 3, the discount factor is 0.9^(3-1) = 0.9^2 = 0.81\n\nTherefore, the present value of the current offer to me is 268 * 0.81 = 217.08\n\nMy outside offer is 568. Since 217.08 < 568, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. Since this is the last round, any counteroffer from Player 2 will be treated as a WALK. This means I need to make an offer that is acceptable to me, given my outside option of 568. The total amount of items are:\n\n* Item 1: 3 units\n* Item 2: 6 units\n* Item 3: 6 units\n* Item 4: 3 units\n* Item 5: 5 units\n\nMy values are: 54, 83, 6, 91, 34\n\nI need to determine if there is a better offer I can make than my outside option.\n\nIf I give Player 2 nothing, I get:\n\n(3 * 54) + (6 * 83) + (6 * 6) + (3 * 91) + (5 * 34) = 162 + 498 + 36 + 273 + 170 = 1139. The discounted value is 1139 * 0.81 = 922.59, which is much greater than my outside offer.\n\nI want to determine the minimal amount I can offer player 2 such that I still beat my outside option. Let's examine if it is plausible for me to make a very small counteroffer and have it be worth it in terms of expected outcome, compared to my outside option.\n\nHere's an idea: I offer to give player 2 the same as their last offer in round 2, which was [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. I keep the rest.\nThat would leave me with [2, 5, 5, 2, 4]. The value to me would be:\n(2 * 54) + (5 * 83) + (5 * 6) + (2 * 91) + (4 * 34) = 108 + 415 + 30 + 182 + 136 = 871\n871 * 0.81 = 705.51, which is better than my outside option.\n\nTherefore, I can offer [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] to Player 2.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 5, 5, 2, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    3 x 0 + 42 x 5 + 83 x 5 + 27 x 2 + 24 x 4\n    which is 775 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 777. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 3, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    20 x 1 + 27 x 1 + 49 x 3 + 93 x 1 + 69 x 3\n    which is 494 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 495. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.
