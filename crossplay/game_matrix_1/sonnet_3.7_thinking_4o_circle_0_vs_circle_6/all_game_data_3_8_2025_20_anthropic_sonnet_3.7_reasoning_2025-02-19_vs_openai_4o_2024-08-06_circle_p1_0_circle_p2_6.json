By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    59 x 0 + 9 x 3 + 26 x 0 + 21 x 0 + 85 x 0\n    which is 27 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 28. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 5, 4, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 5, 4, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 2, 2, 0, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    29 x 3 + 76 x 2 + 29 x 2 + 53 x 0 + 45 x 3\n    which is 432 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 433. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 4, 3, 4, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    55 x 3 + 6 x 4 + 46 x 3 + 81 x 4 + 47 x 1\n    which is 698 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 699. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 3, 1, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 3, 1, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Yes.\n\nLet's propose a counteroffer where we're aiming to receive more value than our outside offer of 699. We need an offer that gives us a total value greater than 699.

Let\u2019s modify the offer to retain more valuable items:\n\nLet's try this:\nCounter offer: [1, 2, 3, 1, 0]\n- Value for this retention set up:\n  - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 55 = 110\n  - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18\n  - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 46 = 92\n  - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243\n  - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 47 = 47\nTotal value: 510 \nWe still fall below the outside offer. Another rearrangement needed. \n\nLet\u2019s try a slightly different setup with more removal of less valued and higher valued item exchange\nCounter offer: [1, 3, 0, 1, 0]\n- Value of the counter offer:\n  - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 55 = 110\n  - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 6 = 12\n  - 5 units of item 3 = 5 \u00d7 46 = 230\n  - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243\n  - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 47 = 47\nTotal value: 642\n\nGiven the pattern without losing sight of the distribution and values, given constraints let\u2019s make an educated final counter offer I expect might come close:\nFinal Counteroffer Logic: [0, 0, 1, 2, 0]\n- Value for leftover:\n  - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 55 = 165\n  - 5 units of item 2 = 5 \u00d7 6 = 30\n  - 4 units of item 3 = 4 \u00d7 46 = 184\n  - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 81 = 162\n  - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 47 = 47\nTotal value: 588\n\nAgain, we find this offer does not achieve our minimum desired value.\nI will make counter for understanding with player 1 further adjustments\n\nFinal Counter:\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 2, 0]}",

                    "response": "I need to determine the best initial offer for this negotiation. Let me analyze the values and come up with a strategy.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the total value of all items:\n- Item 1: 5 units \u00d7 39 = 195\n- Item 2: 6 units \u00d7 52 = 312\n- Item 3: 2 units \u00d7 62 = 124\n- Item 4: 6 units \u00d7 97 = 582\n- Item 5: 3 units \u00d7 34 = 102\nTotal value = 1315\n\nMy outside offer is only 48, which is very low compared to the total value of all items (only about 3.6% of the total value). This means I should try to negotiate a deal rather than walking away.\n\nTo make a strategic initial offer, I want to prioritize keeping the highest-value items for myself. Item 4 has the highest value per unit (97), followed by item 3 (62), item 2 (52), item 1 (39), and item 5 (34).\n\nI should keep most of the high-value items (especially item 4) and offer more of the lower-value items. A reasonable initial offer might be:\n- Give 3 units of item 1 (worth 117 to me)\n- Give 3 units of item 2 (worth 156 to me)\n- Give 0 units of item 3 (keeping all for myself)\n- Give 1 unit of item 4 (worth 97 to me)\n- Give 2 units of item 5 (worth 68 to me)\n\nThe value I'm giving up is 117 + 156 + 0 + 97 + 68 = 438, which is about 33% of the total value.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 2, 2, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    89 x 1 + 94 x 2 + 37 x 2 + 68 x 1 + 40 x 1\n    which is 459 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 460. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This has the same value for me across all rounds.\n- To propose a counteroffer, I need to exceed my outside offer value of 433.\n\nLet's explore a potential counteroffer:\n\n1. Maximum value comes significantly from item 5, having a value of 57 per unit. Retaining the maximum of these would be a good start.\n2. Let\u2019s try to keep 6 units of item 5 and 2 units of item 2, making my value: \n    - 6 units of item 5: 6 \u00d7 57 = 342\n    - 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 42 = 84\n\nThis leaves me with a value of 426, which is close to but not exceeding my outside offer. However, to stay above my outside offer, I might need to adjust more items:\n\n3. Let\u2019s also keep 2 units of item 4:\n    - 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 31 = 62\n\nRe-evaluating, my counteroffer value is:\n- 426 (from items 5 and 2)\n+ 62 (from 2 units of item 4)\n= 488, which is more than 433.\n\nThus, I will propose this counteroffer.\n\n**Counteroffer**: I propose [6, 1, 0, 0, 0] to player 1, keeping 0 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 0 of item 4, and 6 units of item 5.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 2, 2, 0]}",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 4, 3, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    77 x 0 + 95 x 3 + 3 x 4 + 12 x 3 + 95 x 6\n    which is 903 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 923. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 5, 2, 1, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 5, 2, 1, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 2, 3, 5, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    96 x 1 + 65 x 2 + 58 x 3 + 85 x 5 + 9 x 4\n    which is 861 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 862. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 0, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 0, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

Round 1 has a gamma^0 factor, so no discount is applied yet.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - For the current offer [1, 1, 1, 0, 3]:\n     - My value of item 1: 1 \u00d7 96 = 96\n     - My value of item 2: 1 \u00d7 65 = 65\n     - My value of item 3: 1 \u00d7 58 = 58\n     - My value of item 4: 0 \u00d7 85 = 0\n     - My value of item 5: 3 \u00d7 9 = 27\n     - Total value of offer = 96 + 65 + 58 + 0 + 27 = 246\n\n   - The value of this current offer (246) is much lower than my outside offer (862). Hence, accepting the current offer is not advantageous compared to my outside offer.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - The current offer is worse than my outside offer.\n   \n   - Let's determine a counteroffer that would at least match or exceed my outside offer value of 862:\n     - For an example potential split, suppose I keep [2, 6, 2, 4, 2]:\n       - My value calculation would be:\n         - 2 \u00d7 96 + 6 \u00d7 65 + 2 \u00d7 58 + 4 \u00d7 85 + 2 \u00d7 9\n         - = 192 + 390 + 116 + 340 + 18\n         - = 1056\n       - This is greater than my outside offer, hence a good point to start.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 5, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    5 x 0 + 14 x 0 + 63 x 5 + 16 x 2 + 58 x 2\n    which is 463 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 464. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 2, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 2, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

It's important to consider this when deciding whether to accept an offer now versus waiting for potentially better offers in the future.\n\n### 2) Assess the value of offers:\n- **Current offer:** [0, 1, 2, 2, 1]  \n  My total value if I accept = (0 \u00d7 5) + (1 \u00d7 14) + (2 \u00d7 63) + (2 \u00d7 16) + (1 \u00d7 58) = 14 + 126 + 32 + 58 = 230\n\n- **Comparison to my outside offer value:** Accepting the current offer would give me a value of 230, which is less than my outside offer of 464. Therefore, accepting this offer would not be beneficial.\n\n### 3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n- **Should I accept the current offer?** No, because 230 is less than my outside offer of 464.\n- **Should I walk away and take my outside offer?** Not yet, because it's round 1 and I can try to negotiate a better deal.\n- **Should I propose a counteroffer?** Yes, I should propose a counteroffer that gives me more than the outside offer value.\n\n### Calculate a possible counteroffer:\nI will construct a counteroffer ensuring that my value is above 464:\n\nLet's try keeping the majority of high-value items like item 3 and item 5:\n- Keep all units of item 1 and item 2, as they're low in total units.\n- Offer Player 1 some units of items like item 3 and item 4.\n\nProposed counteroffer where I retain items:\n- Keeping: [2, 2, 6, 3, 4]\n  \nCalculate the items I offer:\n- Offering Player 1: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3]\n  \nCalculating the value if I keep [2, 2, 6, 3, 4]:\n- 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 5 = 10\n- 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 14 = 28\n- 6 units of item 3 = 6 \u00d7 63 = 378\n- 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48\n- 4 units of item 5 = 4 \u00d7 58 = 232\n- Total value = 10 + 28 + 378 + 48 + 232 = 696\n\nSince 696 is clearly more than my outside value of 464, I'll make this counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 1, 2, 3]}\n```",

I need to adjust my offer.\n\nLet me try again:\n- Give 1 unit of item 1 (keeping 6 for myself)\n- Give all 3 units of item 2 (keeping 0 for myself)\n- Give 0 units of item 3 (keeping 4 for myself)\n- Give 2 units of item 4 (keeping 4 for myself)\n- Give 0 units of item 5 (keeping 2 for myself)\n\nValue I retain:\n- Item 1: 6 units \u00d7 56 = 336\n- Item 2: 0 units \u00d7 2 = 0\n- Item 3: 4 units \u00d7 91 = 364\n- Item 4: 4 units \u00d7 54 = 216\n- Item 5: 2 units \u00d7 85 = 170\nTotal: 1086\n\nThis is still below my outside offer. Let me adjust one more time:\n\n- Give 0 units of item 1 (keeping 7 for myself)\n- Give all 3 units of item 2 (keeping 0 for myself)\n- Give 0 units of item 3 (keeping 4 for myself)\n- Give 1 unit of item 4 (keeping 5 for myself)\n- Give 0 units of item 5 (keeping 2 for myself)\n\nValue I retain:\n- Item 1: 7 units \u00d7 56 = 392\n- Item 2: 0 units \u00d7 2 = 0\n- Item 3: 4 units \u00d7 91 = 364\n- Item 4: 5 units \u00d7 54 = 270\n- Item 5: 2 units \u00d7 85 = 170\nTotal: 1196\n\nThis is better than my outside offer of 1167, so I'll make this offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 0, 1, 0]}",

                    "prompt": "\n    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\n    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\n    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\n    There are 7 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\n    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\n    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 101.\n    Your private values are 24 for item 1, 14 for item 2, 9 for item 3, 88 for item 4, 27 for item 5.\n    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to your total value of all items, which is 828. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 806. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 806. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 486 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [7, 2, 3, 6, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    24 x 7 + 14 x 2 + 9 x 3 + 88 x 6 + 27 x 2\n    which is 805 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 806. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 3, 0, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 3, 0, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Let's go through the situation step by step following the prompts given:\n\n### 1) Analyzing the Current Situation:\n- **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 806.\n- **Values of the Items:**\n  - Item 1: 24\n  - Item 2: 14\n  - Item 3: 9\n  - Item 4: 88\n  - Item 5: 27\n- **Total Pool of Items:**\n  - 7 units of item 1\n  - 3 units of item 2\n  - 4 units of item 3\n  - 6 units of item 4\n  - 2 units of item 5\n- **Discount Factor Impact:**\n  - The discount factor gamma = 0.9 means that as rounds proceed, the value of any accepted offer is multiplied by gamma to the power of (r-1), where r is the round number.\n  - Accepting early rounds gives a higher present value than doing so in later rounds due to less discounting, emphasizing careful consideration of offers in earlier rounds.\n\n### 2) Assessing the Value of Offers:\n- **Current Offer (offered to me):** [0, 3, 0, 1, 0]\n  - Value = 0*24 (item 1) + 3*14 (item 2) + 0*9 (item 3) + 1*88 (item 4) + 0*27 (item 5)\n  - Value = 0 + 42 + 0 + 88 + 0 = 130\n- **Compare to Outside Offer:**\n  - My outside offer is 806, which is significantly higher than the value of accepting the current offer (130).\n- **Potential Counteroffers:**\n  - To beat my outside offer, I need a distribution where my total value is greater than 806.\n\n### 3) Making a Decision:\n- **Should I Accept the Current Offer?**\n  - No. The current offer value (130) is far less than my outside offer (806).\n- **Should I Walk Away?**\n  - Walking away gives me a guaranteed value of 806. I will walk if no better counteroffer can be proposed or to prevent making negotiation mistakes.\n- **Consider a Counteroffer:**\n  - Given my item values, I need to construct a counteroffer that gives me a total value greater than 806.\n\n### Decision:\n- I should make a counteroffer. My goal is to calculate a distribution that ensures I achieve a value over 806.\n\nCalculating a possible counteroffer:\n- Let's try keeping most of the higher value items:\n  - Item 1: Give away 0, keep 7 (7*24 = 168)\n  - Item 2: Give away 0, keep 3 (3*14 = 42)\n  - Item 3: Give away 0, keep 4 (4*9 = 36)\n  - Item 4: Give away 1, keep 5 (5*88 = 440)\n  - Item 5: Give away 0, keep 2 (2*27 = 54)\n\nCalculating the value if I keep this proposed distribution:\n- Total value to me: 168 + 42 + 36 + 440 + 54 = 740\n\nThis is less than my outside offer of 806, so I need to adjust:\n\nLet me refine and try keeping:\n- 7 item 1, 1 item 2, 3 item 3, 6 item 4, 2 item 5.\n\nResulting in:\n- Item 1: Keep 7 (7*24 = 168)\n- Item 2: Give away 2, keep 1 (1*14 = 14)\n- Item 3: Keep 3 (3*9 = 27)\n- Item 4: Keep 6 (6*88 = 528)\n- Item 5: Keep 2 (2*27 = 54)\n\nNew total for me: 168 + 14 + 27 + 528 + 54 = 791\n\nStill not above 806. Let's further adjust:\n- Keep all item 1, half of item 4.\n\nSo keep:\n- 7 item 1, 0 item 2, 4 item 3, 3 item 4, 2 item 5.\n\nCalculating these:\n- Item 1: 7 * 24 = 168\n- Item 2: 0 * 14 = 0\n- Item 3: 4 * 9 = 36\n- Item 4: 3 * 88 = 264\n- Item 5: 2 * 27 = 54\n\nTotal = 168 + 0 + 36 + 264 + 54 = 522, still below the outside.\n\nTrying a new approach:\nLet\u2019s split item 4 equally to see a balance value distribution:\n- Give 4, keep 2:\n  2*88 = 176, which will be the max feasible with outs.\n\nFinal counter trial:\n**Counteroffer configuration:**\n- I'll give [0, 2, 4, 4, 0], which should give them prominence in 2 items.\n\nHence my action:\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 4, 4, 0]}",

Let's go through this step-by-step:\n\n1) Analyzing the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 806.\n   - My values for the items are:\n     - Item 1: 24\n     - Item 2: 14\n     - Item 3: 9\n     - Item 4: 88\n     - Item 5: 27\n   - The total pool of items consists of:\n     - 7 units of item 1\n     - 3 units of item 2\n     - 4 units of item 3\n     - 6 units of item 4\n     - 2 units of item 5\n   - The discount factor, gamma, is 0.9, which will affect the present value of the negotiation outcome. Since we're in round 2, the value of an acceptance would need to exceed 806 / 0.9 = 895.56 to be more favorable than waiting for a potentially better round 3 offer.\n\n2) Assessing the value of offers:\n   - Current offer [0, 3, 0, 3, 0]:\n     - 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 24 = 0\n     - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42\n     - 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 9 = 0\n     - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264\n     - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 27 = 0\n     - Total Value = 306\n     - Adjusted for discount in round 2: 306 * 0.9 = 275.4\n\n   - My outside offer is 806, which is substantially higher than the discounted value of accepting the current offer (275.4). Thus, accepting the current offer is not beneficial.\n   \n   - Potential counteroffers:\n     I need to ensure my counteroffer yields a value greater than my outside offer of 806 after being discounted in the next round (which would be multiplied by 0.9^2 = 0.81 for a potential round 3 value). The minimum current round value needed would be 806 / 0.81 = approximately 995.06.\n   \n   One potential counteroffer, maximizing my high-value items (especially item 4), could be:\n     - Allocating fewer items with low value to me and keeping high-value items:\n     - [1, 1, 0, 0, 0] units offer to Player 1 (keeping [6, 2, 4, 6, 2] for myself)\n     - Calculating my value:\n       - 6 units of item 1 = 6 \u00d7 24 = 144\n       - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 14 = 28\n       - 4 units of item 3 = 4 \u00d7 9 = 36\n       - 6 units of item 4 = 6 \u00d7 88 = 528\n       - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 27 = 54\n       - Total Value = 790, discounted for a potential round 3 value: 790 * 0.81 = 639.9\n\nTo ensure making a valid offer better than my outside offer when discounted in another round, the most reasoned approach is to walk away, as offers at similar values don't reach an undoubtable higher value than my outside option.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 0, 2, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    26 x 2 + 72 x 0 + 88 x 0 + 42 x 2 + 71 x 0\n    which is 136 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 138. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 737. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 924 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 6, 0, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    97 x 2 + 76 x 6 + 17 x 0 + 85 x 1 + 33 x 0\n    which is 735 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 737. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Let's break down the situation following the steps outlined:\n\n1) **Analyze the Current Situation:**\n\n   - **Outside Offer Value:** Your outside offer value is 244.\n   - **Values of Items to You:**\n     - Item 1: 85 per unit\n     - Item 2: 54 per unit\n     - Item 3: 92 per unit\n     - Item 4: 38 per unit\n     - Item 5: 28 per unit\n   - **Total Pool of Items:**\n     - 3 units of item 1\n     - 4 units of item 2\n     - 6 units of item 3\n     - 0 units of item 4\n     - 5 units of item 5\n   - **Discount Factor (gamma = 0.9):** This affects the value of delayed negotiations, reducing the effective value of a deal by 10% per round beyond the first. Immediate acceptance of a favorable offer is typically preferable due to eliminating the time discount.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n\n   - **Current Offer [0, 1, 0, 0, 5]:**\n\n     Calculate the value if you accept it:\n     - Value from 1 unit of item 2: \\(1 \\times 54 = 54\\)\n     - Value from 5 units of item 5: \\(5 \\times 28 = 140\\)\n     - Total value if accepted: \\(54 + 140 = 194\\)\n\n     Since 194 is less than your outside offer of 244, accepting this offer is not better than walking away.\n\n   - **Potential Counteroffers:**\n\n     You need a counteroffer that gives a value greater than 244. For example, let's say you keep 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 3 units of item 3, and no units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5. Calculate:\n\n     - Value from 2 units of item 1: \\(2 \\times 85 = 170\\)\n     - Value from 1 unit of item 2: \\(1 \\times 54 = 54\\)\n     - Value from 3 units of item 3: \\(3 \\times 92 = 276\\)\n     - Value from 1 unit of item 5: \\(1 \\times 28 = 28\\)\n     - Total value if kept: \\(170 + 54 + 276 + 28 = 528\\)\n\n     You would offer the remainder: [1, 3, 3, 0, 4].\n     This value is much larger than 244, and hence, more valuable to you.\n\n3) **Make a Decision:**\n\nGiven all calculations,\n- Accepting the current offer (worth 194) is worse than your outside offer (244).\n- Walking away would give you a value of 244.\n- A counteroffer like [1, 3, 3, 0, 4] gives you 528, which is significantly better than both.\n\nHence, I should make a counteroffer to Player 1.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 3, 3, 0, 4]}",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 2, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    85 x 0 + 54 x 0 + 92 x 2 + 38 x 0 + 28 x 2\n    which is 240 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 244. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 620. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 620. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 936 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 5, 2, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    84 x 0 + 82 x 5 + 94 x 2 + 32 x 0 + 20 x 1\n    which is 618 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 620. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 5, 3, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 5, 3, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Let's walk through the analysis step by step:\n\n### 1) Analyze the Current Situation\n\n**Outside Offer Value:**\n- Your guaranteed outside offer value is 620.\n  \n**Values of the Items:**\n- Item 1: 84 per unit\n- Item 2: 82 per unit\n- Item 3: 94 per unit\n- Item 4: 32 per unit\n- Item 5: 20 per unit\n\n**Total Pool of Items:**\n- Total units available: [2, 5, 3, 2, 3] for each item respectively.\n\n**Discount Factor:**\n- The discount factor is gamma = 0.9. This means that as each round passes, the effective value of an offer is multiplied by \\(\\gamma^{(r-1)}\\), where r is the round number. However, since this is round 1, the discount factor doesn't yet influence the decision.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers\n\n**Current Offer: [0, 5, 3, 2, 0]**\n- My Value: \n  - Item 1: 0 \u00d7 84 = 0\n  - Item 2: 5 \u00d7 82 = 410\n  - Item 3: 3 \u00d7 94 = 282\n  - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 32 = 64\n  - Item 5: 0 \u00d7 20 = 0\n- Total Value if Accepted: 0 + 410 + 282 + 64 + 0 = 756\n\n**Comparison to Outside Offer:**\n- 756 (value of the current offer) is greater than my outside offer of 620.\n\n**Potential Counteroffers:**\n- Given that I should aim for an outcome better than 620, the current offer already provides a value of 756, which is quite good. Any counteroffer must exceed this 756 value to be considered more favorable.\n\n### 3) Decision\n\n**Decision Criteria:**\n- The current offer of value 756 is better than the outside offer and would be adjusted by the discounting in future rounds. At this point, accepting it maximizes my current known value without risking a reduction in future rounds due to discounting.\n\nTherefore, my best course of action, given the current offer surpasses my outside offer value with no information about future proposals potentially being better, is to ACCEPT this offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 3, 0, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    92 x 3 + 82 x 3 + 40 x 0 + 36 x 2 + 59 x 2\n    which is 712 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 713. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 2, 2, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 1, 0, 3, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 1, 3, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 1, 3, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

Thus the effective value I derive from any offer is 90% of its nominal value in terms of my item valuations.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n- **Current Offer** (offered to me by Player 1): [2, 1, 1, 3, 2]\n\n  Calculate my value:\n  - 2 units of item 1: \\(2 \\times 92 = 184\\)\n  - 1 unit of item 2: \\(1 \\times 82 = 82\\)\n  - 1 unit of item 3: \\(1 \\times 40 = 40\\)\n  - 3 units of item 4: \\(3 \\times 36 = 108\\)\n  - 2 units of item 5: \\(2 \\times 59 = 118\\)\n\n  Nominal Total Value = \\(184 + 82 + 40 + 108 + 118 = 532\\)\n  \n  Adjusted Value considering discount = \\(532 \\times 0.9 = 478.8\\)\n\n  Since 478.8 (adjusted value of current offer) is less than my outside offer of 713, I should not accept this offer.\n\n- **Potential Counteroffers**:\n  I must propose a counteroffer that provides a nominal value greater than 713 to ensure it is better than my outside offer after adjusting for the discount.\n\n  A possible division could be:\n  - I keep 3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5\n  - Offer to Player 1: [2, 1, 2, 3, 2]\n\n  Calculate my value for this division:\n  - 3 units of item 1: \\(3 \\times 92 = 276\\)\n  - 2 units of item 2: \\(2 \\times 82 = 164\\)\n  - 1 unit of item 3: \\(1 \\times 40 = 40\\)\n  - 2 units of item 4: \\(2 \\times 36 = 72\\)\n  - 1 unit of item 5: \\(1 \\times 59 = 59\\)\n  \n  Nominal Total Value = \\(276 + 164 + 40 + 72 + 59 = 611\\)\n  \n  Adjusted Value considering discount = \\(611 \\times 0.9 = 549.9\\)\n  \n  This is still less than my outside offer of 713, so it's inadequate.\n\n  Iterate further: Maybe shift more low-value items to Player 1 to balance.\n  \n  Try [2, 1, 2, 1, 2] to the Player:\n  - I keep 3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5\n  - Offer to Player 1: [2, 1, 2, 1, 2]\n\n  Calculate my value for this counteroffer:\n  - 3 units of item 1: \\(3 \\times 92 = 276\\)\n  - 2 units of item 2: \\(2 \\times 82 = 164\\)\n  - 1 unit of item 3: \\(1 \\times 40 = 40\\)\n  - 4 units of item 4: \\(4 \\times 36 = 144\\)\n  - 1 unit of item 5: \\(1 \\times 59 = 59\\)\n\n  Nominal Total Value = \\(276 + 164 + 40 + 144 + 59 = 683\\)\n  \n  Adjusted Value considering discount = \\(683 \\times 0.9 = 614.7\\)\n\n  Still less than 713.\n\n  Try [2, 1, 1, 1, 0]:\n  - I keep 3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5\n  - Offer to Player 1: [2, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n\n  Calculate my value:\n  - 3 units of item 1: \\(3 \\times 92 = 276\\)\n  - 2 units of item 2: \\(2 \\times 82 = 164\\)\n  - 2 units of item 3: \\(2 \\times 40 = 80\\)\n  - 4 units of item 4: \\(4 \\times 36 = 144\\)\n  - 3 units of item 5: \\(3 \\times 59 = 177\\)\n\n  Nominal Total Value = \\(276 + 164 + 80 + 144 + 177 = 841\\)\n\n  Adjusted Value considering discount = \\(841 \\times 0.9 = 756.9\\)\n\n- Comparing to my outside offer of 713, this proposed allocation exceeds my outside offer value adjusted for the discount factor.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision:\nBased on the analysis, I will propose a counteroffer that improves my payoff beyond my outside offer, factoring in the discount.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 3, 3, 4, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    22 x 2 + 63 x 3 + 53 x 3 + 99 x 4 + 39 x 3\n    which is 905 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 906. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 0, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 0, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Let's evaluate the current situation and potential actions:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Current Situation:\n- **Outside Offer Value**: 906\n- **My Values for the Items**:\n  - Item 1: 22\n  - Item 2: 63\n  - Item 3: 53\n  - Item 4: 99\n  - Item 5: 39\n- **Total Pool of Items**:\n  - 5 units of item 1\n  - 3 units of item 2\n  - 7 units of item 3\n  - 4 units of item 4\n  - 4 units of item 5\n- **Discount Factor**: 0.9 per round delay. For round 1, this factor does not affect the current offer.\n\n### 2. Assess the Value of Offers:\n- **Current Offer to Me** ([0, 2, 0, 2, 1]):\n  - Item 1: 0 \u00d7 22 = 0\n  - Item 2: 2 \u00d7 63 = 126\n  - Item 3: 0 \u00d7 53 = 0\n  - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 99 = 198\n  - Item 5: 1 \u00d7 39 = 39\n  - Total = 0 + 126 + 0 + 198 + 39 = 363\n\nThis total (363) is significantly less than my outside offer value (906).\n\n### 3. Evaluate Potential Counteroffers:\nI need to construct a counteroffer that exceeds my outside offer value. Let's try a different division that increases my value over 906. I will start by considering keeping the majority of the higher value items I hold, like items 3 (due to its quantity) and 4 (due to the high per-unit value).\n\nA potential counteroffer where I take:\n- 3 units of item 1\n- 1 unit of item 2\n- 5 units of item 3\n- 3 units of item 4\n- 3 units of item 5\n\nAnd offer the rest to Player 1:\n- Offer: [2, 2, 2, 1, 1]\n\nValue of my potential counteroffer:\n- Item 1: 3 \u00d7 22 = 66\n- Item 2: 1 \u00d7 63 = 63\n- Item 3: 5 \u00d7 53 = 265\n- Item 4: 3 \u00d7 99 = 297\n- Item 5: 3 \u00d7 39 = 117\n- Total = 66 + 63 + 265 + 297 + 117 = 808\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nMy hypothetical counteroffer results in a value of 808, which is still less than my outside offer value of 906. I need to adjust the offer a bit more to make sure it is above 906.\n\nLet's try another approach to maximize value:\n\nOffer: [1, 1, 2, 1, 1] (meaning I keep 4, 2, 5, 3, 3) \n\nRecalculating my new values:\n- Item 1: 4 \u00d7 22 = 88\n- Item 2: 2 \u00d7 63 = 126\n- Item 3: 5 \u00d7 53 = 265\n- Item 4: 3 \u00d7 99 = 297\n- Item 5: 3 \u00d7 39 = 117\n- Total = 88 + 126 + 265 + 297 + 117 = 893\n\nThis is still under 906, so even this more aggressive counter is inadequate. Thus, I should conservatively try to keep more valuable items and possibly adjust my expectations for a slightly skewed but higher valuation offer.\n\nGiven that patterns seem hard to squeeze without expecting a bit more item allocation my way, I propose further iteration, but meanwhile I accept a mathematically sound and direct step to reconsider for adjustment phase.\n\n### Proposed Action:\n- **Counteroffer**: [1, 1, 3, 0, 2]\n\nRecalculate:\n- Item 1: 4 \u00d7 22 = 88\n- Item 2: 2 \u00d7 63 = 126\n- Item 3: 6 \u00d7 53 = 318\n- Item 4: 4 \u00d7 99 = 396\n- Item 5: 2 \u00d7 39 = 78\n- Total = 88 + 126 + 318 + 396 + 78 = 1006\n\nThis counteroffer results in a value of 1006 to me, which is greater than my outside offer value of 906. Now it becomes an economically sensible offer, maintaining a required upper band. \n\nHence, my counteroffer is structured to ensure beneficial acceptance without over-expositioning towards loss, responding to original assess dynamics with functional increment motives:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 3, 0, 2]}\n```",

                    "response": "To decide on the best course of action, let's carefully analyze the current situation, evaluate the offers, and make a well-informed decision.\n\n### 1) Analyze the Current Situation:\n- **Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer value is 906.\n- **Values of the Items**: My personal valuation per unit is: \n  - Item 1: 22\n  - Item 2: 63\n  - Item 3: 53\n  - Item 4: 99\n  - Item 5: 39\n- **Total Pool of Items**:\n  - 5 units of item 1\n  - 3 units of item 2\n  - 7 units of item 3\n  - 4 units of item 4\n  - 4 units of item 5\n- **Discount Factor**: It is currently round 2, so if I accept the deal now, the value will be discounted by \\(0.9^{(2-1)} = 0.9\\).\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n#### Current Offer (Player 1's Offer):\nOffers me: \n- 1 unit of item 1 \n- 1 unit of item 2 \n- 2 units of item 3 \n- 2 units of item 4 \n- 1 unit of item 5\n\nCalculate Value to Me:\n- Item 1: \\(1 \\times 22 = 22\\)\n- Item 2: \\(1 \\times 63 = 63\\)\n- Item 3: \\(2 \\times 53 = 106\\)\n- Item 4: \\(2 \\times 99 = 198\\)\n- Item 5: \\(1 \\times 39 = 39\\)\n- Total Value: \\(428\\)\n- Discounted Total Value = \\(428 \\times 0.9 = 385.2\\)\n\n#### Comparison to Outside Offer:\n- Discounted value of current offer (\\(385.2\\)) is significantly less than my outside offer (\\(906\\)).\n\n#### Making a Counteroffer:\nI need to determine an offer where the value I retain (after any proposed distribution) exceeds my outside offer. The offer must provide a total value for me greater than 906, without making any of the bargaining mistakes outlined.\n\nLet's try offering [2, 2, 3, 1, 2] to Player 1, which means I keep [3, 1, 4, 3, 2]:\n\nCalculate My Retained Value:\n- Items kept: [3, 1, 4, 3, 2]\n- Value to Me:\n  - Item 1: \\(3 \\times 22 = 66\\)\n  - Item 2: \\(1 \\times 63 = 63\\)\n  - Item 3: \\(4 \\times 53 = 212\\)\n  - Item 4: \\(3 \\times 99 = 297\\)\n  - Item 5: \\(2 \\times 39 = 78\\)\n  - Total Value: \\(716\\)\n  - Discounted Total Value = \\(716 \\times 0.9 = 644.4\\)\n\nBut 644.4 is still less than 906, so this isn't viable. Let's attempt another allocation:\n\nNew Counteroffer: Offer [1, 1, 3, 1, 1] to Player 1, which means I keep [4, 2, 4, 3, 3]:\n\nCalculate My Retained Value:\n- Items kept: [4, 2, 4, 3, 3]\n- Value to Me:\n  - Item 1: \\(4 \\times 22 = 88\\)\n  - Item 2: \\(2 \\times 63 = 126\\)\n  - Item 3: \\(4 \\times 53 = 212\\)\n  - Item 4: \\(3 \\times 99 = 297\\)\n  - Item 5: \\(3 \\times 39 = 117\\)\n  - Total Value: \\(840\\)\n  - Discounted Total Value = \\(840 \\times 0.9 = 756\\)\n\nAgain less than 906. Trying once more:\n\nCounteroffer: Offer [2, 1, 3, 1, 1] to Player 1, which means I retain [3, 2, 4, 3, 3]:\n\nCalculate My Retained Value:\n- Items kept: [3, 2, 4, 3, 3]\n- Value to Me:\n  - Item 1: \\(3 \\times 22 = 66\\)\n  - Item 2: \\(2 \\times 63 = 126\\)\n  - Item 3: \\(4 \\times 53 = 212\\)\n  - Item 4: \\(3 \\times 99 = 297\\)\n  - Item 5: \\(3 \\times 39 = 117\\)\n  - Total Value: \\(818\\)\n  - Discounted Total Value = \\(818 \\times 0.9 = 736.2\\)\n\n### 3) Make a Decision:\nNo potential counteroffered values have exceeded my outside offer of 906. The current offer also significantly underperforms relative to my outside offer. Thus, it is currently in my best interest to walk away with my outside offer value. \n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 2, 1, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    48 x 0 + 30 x 0 + 38 x 2 + 5 x 1 + 15 x 4\n    which is 141 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 142. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 4, 2, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 3, 4, 2, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 325. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 325. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 825 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 2, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    7 x 0 + 81 x 1 + 93 x 2 + 57 x 1 + 37 x 0\n    which is 324 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 325. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 3, 2, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 3, 2, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

Additionally, creating a counteroffer might introduce the risk of lowering my potential payoff if the negotiation extends into future rounds with a potential discount.\n\nTherefore, given the current situation and the offer on the table, the best decision is to accept the offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 4, 0, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    85 x 0 + 14 x 2 + 67 x 4 + 54 x 0 + 71 x 6\n    which is 722 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 723. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 4, 1, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 4, 1, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 0, 6, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    2 x 1 + 81 x 0 + 18 x 0 + 27 x 6 + 15 x 3\n    which is 209 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 210. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 0, 2, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 3, 0, 2, 2]\n\n    What is your action?
