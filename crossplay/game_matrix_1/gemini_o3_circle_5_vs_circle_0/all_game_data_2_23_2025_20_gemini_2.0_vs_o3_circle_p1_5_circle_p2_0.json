Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 231. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 231. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 792 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 3, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    65 x 0 + 18 x 0 + 75 x 3 + 95 x 0 + 11 x 0\n    which is 225 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 231. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best course of action for Round 1.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n   - My outside offer value is 231.\n   - My values for the items are: item 1 = 65, item 2 = 18, item 3 = 75, item 4 = 95, item 5 = 11.\n   - The total pool of items is: 6 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor is 0.9. This means accepting an offer in later rounds is worth less than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - There is no current offer.\n   - I need to formulate an initial offer to Player 2. The goal is to find an offer that is likely to be accepted while maximizing my own value. A reasonable starting point is often an equal split, or slightly favoring myself given I am Player 1 and have the first move. Since there are different numbers of units for each item, an exact even split isn't always possible.\n\n   Let's consider the following: I'll try offering Player 2 roughly half of items 1, 3, and 4. Item 2, which only has a value of 1 unit, I will also give away to the other player, and item 5 which has a value of 0 units, I will also offer to the other player. I will offer Player 2 3 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n   This would leave me with 3 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n\n   My value for this division would be:\n   - 3 units of item 1: 3 * 65 = 195\n   - 1 unit of item 2: 1 * 18 = 18\n   - 2 units of item 3: 2 * 75 = 150\n   - 1 unit of item 4: 1 * 95 = 95\n   - 0 units of item 5: 0 * 11 = 0\n   - Total value: 195 + 18 + 150 + 95 + 0 = 458\n\n   This value (458) is much greater than my outside offer (231). Therefore, offering [3, 1, 1, 1, 0] should be better than walking away.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   - I should propose the counteroffer [3, 1, 1, 1, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 1, 1, 1, 0]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1007. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 882 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 2, 5, 7, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    98 x 1 + 34 x 2 + 47 x 5 + 65 x 7 + 50 x 3\n    which is 1006 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1007. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 3, 2, 2, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 3, 2, 2, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action.\n\n1.  **Analyze the current situation:**\n    *   My outside offer value: 1007\n    *   My item values: item 1 = 98, item 2 = 34, item 3 = 47, item 4 = 65, item 5 = 50\n    *   Total items: 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 7 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5\n    *   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means accepting an offer later is worth less than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2.  **Assess the value of offers:**\n    *   **Current offer:** I receive [1, 3, 2, 2, 2].\n        *   Value: (1 * 98) + (3 * 34) + (2 * 47) + (2 * 65) + (2 * 50) = 98 + 102 + 94 + 130 + 100 = 524\n    *   Since this is round 2, we discount the current offer by gamma, that is, 0.9. The discounted value is 524 * 0.9 = 471.6.\n    *   This discounted value (471.6) is much lower than my outside offer (1007), so accepting is not a good idea.\n\n    Now, let's consider making a counteroffer. I need to keep enough items to exceed my outside offer value of 1007.\n\n    Let's calculate my total value if I keep everything:\n    (2 * 98) + (3 * 34) + (5 * 47) + (7 * 65) + (4 * 50) = 196 + 102 + 235 + 455 + 200 = 1188\n\n    Therefore, any offer that gives me a value higher than 1007 is better than walking away. To avoid mistake 3, I will not offer everything or nothing. Player 2's offer in round 1 was [1,3,2,2,2]. The current offer on the table is the same [1,3,2,2,2]. Player 1's offer in round 1 was [0,0,1,0,0].\n\n    If I offered Player 2 what they offered me, [1,3,2,2,2], I keep [1,0,3,5,2]. This gives me:\n    (1*98) + (0*34) + (3*47) + (5*65) + (2*50) = 98 + 0 + 141 + 325 + 100 = 664\n\n    This is a bad offer for me, since 664 * 0.9 = 597.6 which is less than 1007.\n\n    I need to aim for a value close to 1007, but greater than it. Let's try offering the other player [0,0,2,4,2]. This means that I keep [2,3,3,3,2]. My value is:\n     (2*98) + (3*34) + (3*47) + (3*65) + (2*50) = 196 + 102 + 141 + 195 + 100 = 734.\n    This is still too low, so I will WALK.\n    \n\n**Decision:**\nSince the best value I can get is the one I got in the initial analysis of 471.6, which is less than my outside offer, I will walk away.\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

This means that getting a deal in later rounds is worth less than getting a deal now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider various possible divisions and calculate their value to me. I should aim for a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than my outside offer of 172. The goal is to get the best deal I can while also avoiding making mistakes (as outlined earlier). Since I am Player 1, I must make the first offer.\n*   If I accept the current offer (which is none), I will be walking away with nothing.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   I shouldn't accept the current offer (as there is none), as this will yield zero value, which is less than my outside offer value of 172.\n*   I shouldn't walk away immediately, as I haven't explored any potential deals that could be better than my outside offer.\n*   I should propose a counteroffer.\n\nNow, I need to determine a reasonable counteroffer. I should consider the total number of items and my values for each item. I want to retain items that I value highly (items 1, 2, and 3) while potentially offering more of items 4 and 5 to Player 2.

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 249. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 249. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 840 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 1, 0, 1, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    13 x 2 + 87 x 1 + 93 x 0 + 39 x 1 + 48 x 2\n    which is 248 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 249. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

This means that an offer accepted in later rounds is worth less than an offer accepted now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - Current offer: There is no current offer.\n   - Potential counteroffers: I need to consider what offers I can make that are better than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Develop a strategy:**\n\n   - Since this is round 1, I want to make an offer that gives Player 2 enough to consider staying in the negotiation, but also secures a good deal for me. I need to find an offer for Player 2 which leaves me more than my outside option, 249.\n   - Mistake 3 suggests I avoid offering all or none of the items at this stage.\n   - I can start by figuring out the total value of all the items. 2*13 + 5*87 + 4*93 + 6*39 + 2*48 = 26 + 435 + 372 + 234 + 96 = 1163.\n\nLet's consider giving the other player half of the items (rounding where necessary):\nitem 1: 1\nitem 2: 2\nitem 3: 2\nitem 4: 3\nitem 5: 1\nThis leaves me with:\nitem 1: 1\nitem 2: 3\nitem 3: 2\nitem 4: 3\nitem 5: 1\nMy value is:\n1*13 + 3*87 + 2*93 + 3*39 + 1*48 = 13 + 261 + 186 + 117 + 48 = 625.

Accepting this offer is better than walking away.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to consider if I can get an even better offer by making a counteroffer.  Let's calculate my total value possible: (2 * 13) + (5 * 87) + (4 * 93) + (6 * 39) + (2 * 48) = 26 + 435 + 372 + 234 + 96 = 1163.\n\n    Here is the current offer: [1, 2, 1, 3, 1] (being offered to me).

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 1, 0, 1, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    13 x 2 + 87 x 1 + 93 x 0 + 39 x 1 + 48 x 2\n    which is 248 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 249. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 2, 3, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 2, 1, 3, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 2, 4, 1]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [1, 2, 2, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 2, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    63 x 0 + 26 x 0 + 91 x 1 + 44 x 1 + 30 x 3\n    which is 225 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 226. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 2, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 2, 2, 3, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 2, 2, 3, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 226\n*   My values for items: Item 1: 63, Item 2: 26, Item 3: 91, Item 4: 44, Item 5: 30\n*   Total items: Item 1: 4, Item 2: 4, Item 3: 4, Item 4: 6, Item 5: 3\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means accepting an offer later is worth less than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** I am offered [2, 2, 2, 3, 1]. This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 4 - 2 = 2\n    *   Item 2: 4 - 2 = 2\n    *   Item 3: 4 - 2 = 2\n    *   Item 4: 6 - 3 = 3\n    *   Item 5: 3 - 1 = 2\n    Value of current offer to me: (2 * 63) + (2 * 26) + (2 * 91) + (3 * 44) + (2 * 30) = 126 + 52 + 182 + 132 + 60 = 552\n    Since this is round 2, the discounted value is 552 * 0.9^(2-1) = 552 * 0.9 = 496.8\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** Let's consider a counteroffer. I want to find an offer that gives me a value greater than 226 and leaves the other player with something they might accept.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\nThe current offer's value is 496.8, which is much higher than my outside offer of 226. Therefore, I shouldn't walk away.\n\nNow, let's think about whether I should accept the current offer or make a counteroffer. Since this is round 2, making a counteroffer means my payoff gets multiplied by 0.9. If I can get an offer that's even slightly better, it might be worth it to propose a counteroffer. Let's consider if I can improve from my original round 1 offer.\nMy round 1 offer was [1, 1, 1, 2, 1] to Player 2.\nThis means I keep:\nItem 1: 4-1 = 3\nItem 2: 4-1 = 3\nItem 3: 4-1 = 3\nItem 4: 6-2 = 4\nItem 5: 3-1 = 2\nValue to me: 3*63 + 3*26 + 3*91 + 4*44 + 2*30 = 189 + 78 + 273 + 176 + 60 = 776\nDiscounted value at round 2: 776 * 0.9 = 698.4\n\nLet's try an offer close to what player 2 offered me in the first round [2, 2, 2, 3, 1]. If I offer that to player 2 now, I keep\nItem 1: 4-2 = 2\nItem 2: 4-2 = 2\nItem 3: 4-2 = 2\nItem 4: 6-3 = 3\nItem 5: 3-1 = 2\nValue to me: (2 * 63) + (2 * 26) + (2 * 91) + (3 * 44) + (2 * 30) = 126 + 52 + 182 + 132 + 60 = 552\nDiscounted value at round 2: 552 * 0.9 = 496.8\n\nLet's try an offer of [1,1,1,3,1]. This means I keep:\nItem 1: 4-1 = 3\nItem 2: 4-1 = 3\nItem 3: 4-1 = 3\nItem 4: 6-3 = 3\nItem 5: 3-1 = 2\nValue to me: 3*63 + 3*26 + 3*91 + 3*44 + 2*30 = 189 + 78 + 273 + 132 + 60 = 732\nDiscounted value at round 2: 732 * 0.9 = 658.8\n\nLet's try an offer of [2,2,1,3,1]. This means I keep:\nItem 1: 4-2 = 2\nItem 2: 4-2 = 2\nItem 3: 4-1 = 3\nItem 4: 6-3 = 3\nItem 5: 3-1 = 2\nValue to me: 2*63 + 2*26 + 3*91 + 3*44 + 2*30 = 126 + 52 + 273 + 132 + 60 = 643\nDiscounted value at round 2: 643 * 0.9 = 578.7\n\nLet's consider an offer that would be beneficial for the other player. I will go for [1, 1, 1, 3, 1].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 3, 1]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 541. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 708 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 5, 1, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    2 x 1 + 76 x 5 + 95 x 1 + 26 x 1 + 37 x 1\n    which is 540 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 541. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 500. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 828 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 4, 8, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    68 x 0 + 99 x 1 + 49 x 4 + 14 x 8 + 46 x 2\n    which is 499 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 500. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 4, 2, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    79 x 0 + 48 x 0 + 99 x 4 + 63 x 2 + 2 x 6\n    which is 534 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 535. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's start by analyzing the situation.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value is 535.\n*   My values for the items are: item 1 = 79, item 2 = 48, item 3 = 99, item 4 = 63, item 5 = 2.\n*   The total pool of items is: 7 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5.\n*   The discount factor is 0.9. This means that offers accepted in later rounds are worth less to both players.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   Since there is no current offer, I need to think about an initial offer. I want to make an offer that Player 2 might find appealing, but also leaves me with a value greater than my outside offer.\n*   Mistake 3 reminds me to avoid extreme offers, so I should avoid offering all or none of the items.\n\nLet's start by creating an offer where I give the other player roughly half the value in each item. This will allow me to maintain a higher payoff than my outside offer.\nHere's a possible initial offer: I give Player 2: 3 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5. I keep the remaining items.\n\nMy value if I keep: 4 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5\n4 * 79 + 1 * 48 + 2 * 99 + 1 * 63 + 3 * 2 = 316 + 48 + 198 + 63 + 6 = 631\n\nMy value, 631, is greater than my outside offer of 535, so this offer isn't a mistake based on Mistake 2.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\nI will make the counteroffer calculated above.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 0, 2, 1, 3]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 7, 4, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    64 x 2 + 57 x 7 + 51 x 4 + 73 x 1 + 41 x 1\n    which is 845 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 847. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 847\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 64, Item 2: 57, Item 3: 51, Item 4: 73, Item 5: 41\n*   **Total pool of items:** Item 1: 4, Item 2: 7, Item 3: 4, Item 4: 1, Item 5: 4\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means waiting for a later round reduces the value of any deal.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find an offer that gives me a value greater than my outside offer of 847. I will start by offering the other player half of the items and adjusting from there.\n\nLet's calculate the value of keeping half of all items for myself, rounded down: 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n\nValue = (2 * 64) + (3 * 57) + (2 * 51) + (0 * 73) + (2 * 41) = 128 + 171 + 102 + 0 + 82 = 483.\n\nThat leaves the following offer to Player 2: 2 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 2 units of item 5. This gives me a terrible value. I need to aim for a value above 847.\nLet's try offering a smaller amount to Player 2.\n\nLet's try offering Player 2 1 unit of each item:\n\nOffering Player 2: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nWhat I keep: 3 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5.\nMy Value: (3 * 64) + (6 * 57) + (3 * 51) + (0 * 73) + (3 * 41) = 192 + 342 + 153 + 0 + 123 = 810\n\nThis is still less than my outside offer of 847.\n\nLet's offer nothing of the most valuable item. That is item 4.\nLet's offer [1, 1, 1, 0, 1] to Player 2.\nThis leaves me with: 3 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 3 units of item 5.\nValue = (3*64)+(6*57)+(3*51)+(1*73)+(3*41) = 192+342+153+73+123 = 883\n\nThis is greater than my outside offer of 847, so this is a good start.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is empty.\n*   My outside offer is 847.\n*   Offering [1, 1, 1, 0, 1] yields a value of 883, which is more than my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 0, 1]}\n```",

This means any deal in round 3 is worth 0.9^2 = 0.81 of its face value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [4, 0, 4, 0, 0]. This means I get 4 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n    My value if I accept this offer: (4 * 64) + (0 * 57) + (4 * 51) + (0 * 73) + (0 * 41) = 256 + 0 + 204 + 0 + 0 = 460.\n    Since 460 < 847, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\n*   **Round 1 Offers:**\n    *   My Round 1 offer: [1, 1, 1, 0, 1] to Player 2. That means I keep [3, 6, 3, 1, 3] items for myself.\n        Value of my Round 1 offer: (3 * 64) + (6 * 57) + (3 * 51) + (1 * 73) + (3 * 41) = 192 + 342 + 153 + 73 + 123 = 883.\n    *   Player 2's Round 1 Offer: [4, 0, 4, 0, 0]. This is the same as the current offer, so the value to me is 460.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find an offer that gives me a value greater than 847 (my outside offer). Let's explore a few possibilities, keeping in mind that I'm in Round 2, so I will discount by a factor of 0.9.\n    *   **Give Player 2 nothing:** Offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I keep everything. My value is (4 * 64) + (7 * 57) + (4 * 51) + (1 * 73) + (4 * 41) = 256 + 399 + 204 + 73 + 164 = 1096. My discounted value would be 1096 * 0.9 = 986.4, which is greater than 847.\n    *   **Try to find a more balanced offer:** To make the offer more palatable to Player 2, let's try to give Player 2 half of the total value. So Player 2 will receive 1096/2 = 548. If player 2's values for all the items are all 101 (the maximum). To find the units to offer to Player 2, we can divide 548/101 = 5.436, which rounded down will be five items of each type if it is available.\n    *   Let's calculate the units to give to Player 2: 1 unit of item 1 = 1 x 64 = 64; 2 units of item 2 = 2 x 57 = 114; 1 unit of item 3 = 1 x 51 = 51; 0 units of item 4 = 0 x 73 = 0; and 1 units of item 5 = 1 x 41 = 41. The total units' worth will be 64 + 114 + 51 + 0 + 41 = 270. If the game gets to the last round, Player 2 will walk, and I will earn 847 discounted by 0.9*0.9, which is roughly 686.\n\n    *   With the aim to achieve a similar outcome, I will offer 1 unit of Item 1, 2 units of Item 2, 1 unit of Item 3, 0 units of Item 4, 1 unit of Item 5 to Player 2. I will keep 3 units of Item 1, 5 units of Item 2, 3 units of Item 3, 1 unit of Item 4, 3 units of Item 5.\n        The offer I will give to Player 2: [1, 2, 1, 0, 1]. The value will be (3 x 64) + (5 x 57) + (3 x 51) + (1 x 73) + (3 x 41) = 192 + 285 + 153 + 73 + 123 = 826. The discounted offer is 826 x 0.9 = 743.4. This is below my outside offer, so I won't make it.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Accepting the current offer is worse than my outside offer.\n*   Walking away gives me 847.\n*   Offering [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] would give me 986.4, which is the best option so far.\n\nTherefore, I will offer Player 2 nothing and keep everything for myself.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 7, 4, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    64 x 2 + 57 x 7 + 51 x 4 + 73 x 1 + 41 x 1\n    which is 845 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 847. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [4, 0, 4, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [4, 0, 4, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [4, 0, 4, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 3, 2, 1, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    11 x 1 + 47 x 3 + 83 x 2 + 15 x 1 + 86 x 6\n    which is 849 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 850. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 2, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [4, 3, 1, 6, 5]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [4, 3, 1, 6, 5]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 850\n*   My values for items: 11 (item 1), 47 (item 2), 83 (item 3), 15 (item 4), 86 (item 5)\n*   Total items: 5 (item 1), 3 (item 2), 2 (item 3), 7 (item 4), 6 (item 5)\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. The current round is 2.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 offers me [4, 3, 1, 6, 5]. This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 5 - 4 = 1 unit\n    *   Item 2: 3 - 3 = 0 units\n    *   Item 3: 2 - 1 = 1 unit\n    *   Item 4: 7 - 6 = 1 unit\n    *   Item 5: 6 - 5 = 1 unit\n    Value of current offer to me: (1 * 11) + (0 * 47) + (1 * 83) + (1 * 15) + (1 * 86) = 11 + 0 + 83 + 15 + 86 = 195\n    Since it is round 2, the discounted value is 195 * (0.9^(2-1)) = 195 * 0.9 = 175.5\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer's value (175.5) is much lower than my outside offer (850). Accepting it would be a mistake.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find an offer that gives me a value greater than 850, considering the discount factor. Let's start by offering the previous Player 1 offer:\n    *   Offer: [1, 0, 0, 2, 1] (what I give to Player 2)\n    *   I keep: [4, 3, 2, 5, 5]\n    *   My value: (4 * 11) + (3 * 47) + (2 * 83) + (5 * 15) + (5 * 86) = 44 + 141 + 166 + 75 + 430 = 856\n    *   Discounted value: 856 * 0.9 = 770.4\n\n    Let's try to create an offer where I keep more valuable items. What if I offered them item 1, item 2, and item 4:\n    *   Offer: [5, 3, 0, 7, 0] (what I give to Player 2)\n    *   I keep: [0, 0, 2, 0, 6]\n    *   My value: (0 * 11) + (0 * 47) + (2 * 83) + (0 * 15) + (6 * 86) = 0 + 0 + 166 + 0 + 516 = 682\n    *   Discounted value: 682 * 0.9 = 613.8\n\n    Let's try to offer them only item 1 and item 4:\n    *   Offer: [5, 0, 0, 7, 0] (what I give to Player 2)\n    *   I keep: [0, 3, 2, 0, 6]\n    *   My value: (0 * 11) + (3 * 47) + (2 * 83) + (0 * 15) + (6 * 86) = 0 + 141 + 166 + 0 + 516 = 823\n    *   Discounted value: 823 * 0.9 = 740.7\n\n    It seems I need to keep most of Item 3 and Item 5. Let's experiment further:\n    *   Offer: [5, 3, 1, 7, 0] (what I give to Player 2)\n    *   I keep: [0, 0, 1, 0, 6]\n    *   My value: (0 * 11) + (0 * 47) + (1 * 83) + (0 * 15) + (6 * 86) = 0 + 0 + 83 + 0 + 516 = 599\n    *   Discounted value: 599 * 0.9 = 539.1\n\n    *   Offer: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    *   I keep: [5, 3, 2, 7, 6]\n    *   My value: (5 * 11) + (3 * 47) + (2 * 83) + (7 * 15) + (6 * 86) = 55 + 141 + 166 + 105 + 516 = 983\n    *   Discounted value: 983 * 0.9 = 884.7\n\n    *   Offer: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n    *   I keep: [4, 2, 1, 6, 5]\n    *   My value: (4 * 11) + (2 * 47) + (1 * 83) + (6 * 15) + (5 * 86) = 44 + 94 + 83 + 90 + 430 = 741\n    *   Discounted value: 741 * 0.9 = 666.9\n\nI will make a counteroffer of all the items because that will still leave me with a better outcome than my outside option.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nI should propose a counteroffer that maximizes my value, but also has a chance of being accepted.\nI will offer Player 2 nothing:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [6, 2, 4, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    52 x 6 + 35 x 2 + 71 x 4 + 20 x 1 + 41 x 3\n    which is 809 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 814. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 814\n*   Item values: Item 1: 52, Item 2: 35, Item 3: 71, Item 4: 20, Item 5: 41\n*   Total items: Item 1: 6, Item 2: 4, Item 3: 4, Item 4: 1, Item 5: 3\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means offers in later rounds are worth less (e.g., an offer worth 814 in round 1 is worth 814 * 0.9 = 732.6 in round 2). Since it is the first round, the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 1\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   Current offer: None.\n*   Potential counteroffers: Since it is the first round, I want to make a counteroffer that leaves me with more than my outside option to ensure I have a better deal than walking away.\n\n3) **Decision-making process:**\n\nI need to propose an offer (what I give to Player 2) that maximizes my value while considering the available items and my outside offer.\n\nTo avoid mistake 3, I should not offer everything or nothing. To avoid mistakes 1, 2, 4, and 5, I must ensure my offer is greater than my outside offer.\n\nLet's start by trying to give Player 2 some items while still exceeding my outside offer. I want to keep the items I value most highly. Given my valuations, I prioritize items 3, 1, and 5, with 2 and 4 being less valuable.\n\nLet's consider an offer where I keep:\n* Item 1: 6\n* Item 2: 0\n* Item 3: 4\n* Item 4: 0\n* Item 5: 3\n\nThis means I offer:\n* Item 1: 0\n* Item 2: 4\n* Item 3: 0\n* Item 4: 1\n* Item 5: 0\n\nMy value would be: 6*52 + 0*35 + 4*71 + 0*20 + 3*41 = 312 + 0 + 284 + 0 + 123 = 719. This is LESS than my outside offer.\n\nLet's increase the items I keep:\n* Item 1: 6\n* Item 2: 1\n* Item 3: 4\n* Item 4: 1\n* Item 5: 3\n\nThis means I offer:\n* Item 1: 0\n* Item 2: 3\n* Item 3: 0\n* Item 4: 0\n* Item 5: 0\n\nMy value would be: 6*52 + 1*35 + 4*71 + 1*20 + 3*41 = 312 + 35 + 284 + 20 + 123 = 774. Still less than my outside offer.\n\nLet's try keeping all items.\n* Item 1: 6\n* Item 2: 4\n* Item 3: 4\n* Item 4: 1\n* Item 5: 3\n\nThis means I offer:\n* Item 1: 0\n* Item 2: 0\n* Item 3: 0\n* Item 4: 0\n* Item 5: 0\n\nMy value would be: 6*52 + 4*35 + 4*71 + 1*20 + 3*41 = 312 + 140 + 284 + 20 + 123 = 879. Greater than my outside offer.\n\nLet's try an offer which is a more balanced:\n* Item 1: 3\n* Item 2: 2\n* Item 3: 2\n* Item 4: 0\n* Item 5: 1\n\nThis means I offer:\n* Item 1: 3\n* Item 2: 2\n* Item 3: 2\n* Item 4: 1\n* Item 5: 2\n\nMy value would be: 3*52 + 2*35 + 2*71 + 0*20 + 1*41 = 156 + 70 + 142 + 0 + 41 = 409. This is LESS than my outside offer.\n\nI need to be careful not to give away too much of my high value items, 1 and 3.\n\nLet's try keeping the maximum of item 3 and 1.\n* Item 1: 6\n* Item 2: 2\n* Item 3: 4\n* Item 4: 0\n* Item 5: 2\n\nThis means I offer:\n* Item 1: 0\n* Item 2: 2\n* Item 3: 0\n* Item 4: 1\n* Item 5: 1\n\nMy value would be: 6*52 + 2*35 + 4*71 + 0*20 + 2*41 = 312 + 70 + 284 + 0 + 82 = 748. Less than my outside offer.\n\nLet's try keeping the maximum of item 3 and 1, and more of the other items:\n* Item 1: 6\n* Item 2: 3\n* Item 3: 4\n* Item 4: 1\n* Item 5: 2\n\nThis means I offer:\n* Item 1: 0\n* Item 2: 1\n* Item 3: 0\n* Item 4: 0\n* Item 5: 1\n\nMy value would be: 6*52 + 3*35 + 4*71 + 1*20 + 2*41 = 312 + 105 + 284 + 20 + 82 = 803. Still less than my outside offer.\n\nLet's try another offer which is a bit more biased towards me.\n* Item 1: 4\n* Item 2: 2\n* Item 3: 3\n* Item 4: 0\n* Item 5: 1\n\nThis means I offer:\n* Item 1: 2\n* Item 2: 2\n* Item 3: 1\n* Item 4: 1\n* Item 5: 2\n\nMy value would be: 4*52 + 2*35 + 3*71 + 0*20 + 1*41 = 208 + 70 + 213 + 0 + 41 = 532. This is LESS than my outside offer.\n\nSince this is round 1, and a smaller offer may be rejected, I should offer player 2 an offer which is close to half of the total value and a bit better than my outside offer.\n\nLet's try to achieve this, by biasing the high value items toward myself\n* Item 1: 4\n* Item 2: 2\n* Item 3: 3\n* Item 4: 0\n* Item 5: 2\n\nThis means I offer:\n* Item 1: 2\n* Item 2: 2\n* Item 3: 1\n* Item 4: 1\n* Item 5: 1\n\nMy value would be: 4*52 + 2*35 + 3*71 + 0*20 + 2*41 = 208 + 70 + 213 + 0 + 82 = 573. This is LESS than my outside offer.\n\nLet me try something less biased:\n* Item 1: 3\n* Item 2: 2\n* Item 3: 2\n* Item 4: 0\n* Item 5: 2\n\nThis means I offer:\n* Item 1: 3\n* Item 2: 2\n* Item 3: 2\n* Item 4: 1\n* Item 5: 1\n\nMy value would be: 3*52 + 2*35 + 2*71 + 0*20 + 2*41 = 156 + 70 + 142 + 0 + 82 = 450. This is LESS than my outside offer.\n\nI am giving away too much with the high value items. Let's give away some item 2 and 5 to compensate.\n* Item 1: 5\n* Item 2: 3\n* Item 3: 3\n* Item 4: 0\n* Item 5: 2\n\nThis means I offer:\n* Item 1: 1\n* Item 2: 1\n* Item 3: 1\n* Item 4: 1\n* Item 5: 1\n\nMy value would be: 5*52 + 3*35 + 3*71 + 0*20 + 2*41 = 260 + 105 + 213 + 0 + 82 = 660. This is LESS than my outside offer.\n\nLet me iterate on that again:\n* Item 1: 5\n* Item 2: 4\n* Item 3: 3\n* Item 4: 0\n* Item 5: 3\n\nThis means I offer:\n* Item 1: 1\n* Item 2: 0\n* Item 3: 1\n* Item 4: 1\n* Item 5: 0\n\nMy value would be: 5*52 + 4*35 + 3*71 + 0*20 + 3*41 = 260 + 140 + 213 + 0 + 123 = 736. This is LESS than my outside offer.\n\nI can give away more of items 2 and 5.\n\n* Item 1: 6\n* Item 2: 4\n* Item 3: 4\n* Item 4: 0\n* Item 5: 3\n\nThis means I offer:\n* Item 1: 0\n* Item 2: 0\n* Item 3: 0\n* Item 4: 1\n* Item 5: 0\n\nMy value would be: 6*52 + 4*35 + 4*71 + 0*20 + 3*41 = 312 + 140 + 284 + 0 + 123 = 859. This is GREATER than my outside offer.\n\nOkay, I think that's a good offer for the first round.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 541. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 582 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 5, 7, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    11 x 0 + 80 x 1 + 1 x 5 + 65 x 7 + 37 x 0\n    which is 540 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 541. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine my best course of action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside Offer Value:** 541\n*   **Item Values:** Item 1: 11, Item 2: 80, Item 3: 1, Item 4: 65, Item 5: 37\n*   **Total Item Pool:** Item 1: 6, Item 2: 5, Item 3: 6, Item 4: 7, Item 5: 2\n*   **Discount Factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that an agreement in later rounds is worth less than an agreement now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** There is no current offer.\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to consider what divisions of items would be beneficial to me. I need to ensure any offer I keep is more than 541.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince there is no current offer, I need to make an initial offer. A good starting point is to consider a roughly even split, then adjust it based on my valuations of the items. I should start with the items Player 2 may value less and I value more. Given my values, I really want to retain as much of item 2 and item 4 as possible. Let's consider offering the following to Player 2:\n\n*   Item 1: 3\n*   Item 2: 1\n*   Item 3: 3\n*   Item 4: 3\n*   Item 5: 1\n\nThis leaves me with:\n\n*   Item 1: 3\n*   Item 2: 4\n*   Item 3: 3\n*   Item 4: 4\n*   Item 5: 1\n\nMy value would then be:\n(3 * 11) + (4 * 80) + (3 * 1) + (4 * 65) + (1 * 37) = 33 + 320 + 3 + 260 + 37 = 653\n\nSince 653 > 541, this is a better offer than walking away. Also, a better offer than keeping no items. It also avoid offering all or no items.\n\nNow, let's consider a different offer which leaves more for me.\nOffer to Player 2:\n\n*   Item 1: 4\n*   Item 2: 0\n*   Item 3: 4\n*   Item 4: 4\n*   Item 5: 1\n\nThis leaves me with:\n\n*   Item 1: 2\n*   Item 2: 5\n*   Item 3: 2\n*   Item 4: 3\n*   Item 5: 1\n\nMy value would then be:\n(2 * 11) + (5 * 80) + (2 * 1) + (3 * 65) + (1 * 37) = 22 + 400 + 2 + 195 + 37 = 656\n\nSince 656 > 541, this is a better offer than walking away. Also, a better offer than keeping no items. It also avoid offering all or no items. Also, this offer is better than the previous counteroffer.\n\nI will make this counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 0, 4, 4, 1]}\n```",

This means any deal in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its face value, and in round 3, it's 0.81 times its face value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer: None\n   - Potential counteroffers: I need to find an offer that maximizes my value while also being potentially acceptable to the other player.  I'll start by considering a relatively generous offer to see how it compares to my outside offer.\n\nLet's try offering Player 2 half of everything. That would mean offering them:\n- Item 1: 2\n- Item 2: 2\n- Item 3: 3\n- Item 4: 3\n- Item 5: 3\n\nThis would leave me with:\n- Item 1: 2\n- Item 2: 2\n- Item 3: 3\n- Item 4: 3\n- Item 5: 3\n\nMy value for this division would be:\n(2 * 3) + (2 * 31) + (3 * 99) + (3 * 23) + (3 * 75) = 6 + 62 + 297 + 69 + 225 = 659\n\nSince 659 is greater than my outside offer of 612, this offer is potentially viable. Let's try offering a little less to the other player.\n\nOffer:\n- Item 1: 1\n- Item 2: 1\n- Item 3: 2\n- Item 4: 2\n- Item 5: 2\n\nThis leaves me with:\n- Item 1: 3\n- Item 2: 3\n- Item 3: 4\n- Item 4: 4\n- Item 5: 4\n\nMy value for this division would be:\n(3 * 3) + (3 * 31) + (4 * 99) + (4 * 23) + (4 * 75) = 9 + 93 + 396 + 92 + 300 = 890\n\nThis is a much better value for me. It's also significantly above my outside offer, giving me a good margin.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - The current offer is None, so I can't accept it.\n   - My outside offer is 612, and I can get a value of 890 with the above counteroffer. Walking away would be a mistake since 890 is greater than 612.\n   - I should propose the counteroffer that gives Player 2 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4 and 2 units of item 5.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 2, 2, 2]}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 1, 0, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    3 x 0 + 31 x 2 + 99 x 1 + 23 x 0 + 75 x 6\n    which is 611 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 612. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This means that offers in later rounds are worth less to me than offers now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   Current offer: There is no current offer.\n*   Potential counteroffers: I need to consider various possible divisions of the items and calculate their values.\n    *   The total value of all items to me is (2 \\* 1) + (1 \\* 12) + (2 \\* 89) + (3 \\* 16) + (3 \\* 64) = 2 + 12 + 178 + 48 + 192 = 432.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\nSince there is no current offer, I need to make an initial offer. I should aim to make an offer that gives me a value higher than my outside offer (156), while also being potentially acceptable to the other player. A completely greedy offer would be to offer nothing to the other player. However, this is likely to be rejected. I need to find a balance.\n\nI will start by proposing an offer where I give away some of the less valuable items and keep most of the more valuable ones.\n\nLet's try offering Player 2: 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 4 and 1 unit of item 5.  Then I would keep: 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 unit of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5.\n\nThe value to me would be: (1 \\* 1) + (1 \\* 12) + (2 \\* 89) + (2 \\* 16) + (2 \\* 64) = 1 + 12 + 178 + 32 + 128 = 351.\n\nThis is much better than my outside offer of 156.\n\nTherefore, my counteroffer will be to offer Player 2 [1, 0, 0, 1, 1].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 1, 1]}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 3, 4, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    37 x 0 + 34 x 2 + 51 x 3 + 76 x 4 + 27 x 0\n    which is 525 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 526.

This means that a deal in round 2 is worth 90% of a deal in round 1, and a deal in round 3 is worth 81% of a deal in round 1.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   There is no current offer on the table.\n*   I need to consider potential counteroffers and their value to me. I want to make an offer that is attractive enough for Player 2 to accept, but also maximizes my value.\n*   Any offer I accept or make must be worth more than my outside offer of 526.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince there is no offer on the table, I need to make an initial offer. I need to decide how many units of each item to offer to Player 2. My goal is to maximize my expected payoff, taking into account the possibility of future rounds and the discount factor. I need to make an offer that is good enough that it might get accepted, but also leaves me with a good value.\n\nLet's start by calculating the total value of all the items if I keep them all:\n7 * 37 + 3 * 34 + 3 * 51 + 6 * 76 + 4 * 27 = 259 + 102 + 153 + 456 + 108 = 1078\n\nNow, let's consider an offer that gives away roughly half the value.  A simple starting point is to offer half the units of each item to player 2. Since we can only offer whole units, let's try offering [3, 1, 1, 3, 2].\n\nThis would leave me with [4, 2, 2, 3, 2].\n\nThe value of this to me is:\n4 * 37 + 2 * 34 + 2 * 51 + 3 * 76 + 2 * 27 = 148 + 68 + 102 + 228 + 54 = 600\n\nSince 600 > 526, this is better than walking away.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 526.\n   - My values for the items are: item 1 = 37, item 2 = 34, item 3 = 51, item 4 = 76, item 5 = 27.\n   - The total pool of items is: 7 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor is 0.9. This means that accepting an offer in round 2 is worth 0.9 times the value of the items, and accepting in round 3 is worth 0.9^2 times the value of the items.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current Offer:** The current offer on the table is [3, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I receive 3 units of item 1. The value of this offer to me is 3 * 37 = 111.\n   - Since 111 < 526, accepting the current offer is worse than my outside offer.\n\n   - **Consider the previous round offer from Player 1 of [3, 1, 1, 3, 2]:** This would mean I receive 3 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 3 units of item 4 and 2 units of item 5.\n     - 3 * 37 = 111\n     - 1 * 34 = 34\n     - 1 * 51 = 51\n     - 3 * 76 = 228\n     - 2 * 27 = 54\n     - Total value = 111 + 34 + 51 + 228 + 54 = 478\n   - The total value of player 1's first offer is 478. 478 * 0.9 > 526 is FALSE (430.2 < 526). Therefore, accepting this offer now is worse than walking away.\n\n   - **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer, considering the discount factor. Let's calculate the value of keeping all the items for myself and the other player receiving nothing. In this case my value would be:\n     - 7 * 37 = 259\n     - 3 * 34 = 102\n     - 3 * 51 = 153\n     - 6 * 76 = 456\n     - 4 * 27 = 108\n     - Total value = 259 + 102 + 153 + 456 + 108 = 1078\n\n     -Since the other player has already offered 3 of item 1 for me, lets evaluate my option for what I could offer them that still gives me > 526 after a discount rate of 0.9.\n\n     -Let's calculate what offers result in a value over 526/0.9 = 584.44. This way, if the other player accepts the outcome, I will be better than walking away. I can achieve this by increasing the amount of item 4 I keep and lowering the amount of item 1 I keep. \n     Let's try offering [0, 0, 0, 3, 0]:\n       - I keep: 7 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 3 of item 4 and 4 of item 5.\n       - 7 * 37 = 259\n       - 3 * 34 = 102\n       - 3 * 51 = 153\n       - 3 * 76 = 228\n       - 4 * 27 = 108\n       - Total value = 259 + 102 + 153 + 228 + 108 = 850.\n     - 850 > 584.44.\n     -Therefore, offering [0, 0, 0, 3, 0] is better than my outside offer value after accounting for the round discount.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - The current offer is worse than my outside offer.\n   - I will propose a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 584.44.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 3, 0]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 3, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    16 x 0 + 64 x 0 + 57 x 3 + 10 x 0 + 51 x 0\n    which is 171 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 174. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its face value, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 0.81 times its face value.  Therefore, there is a cost to delaying agreement, and a potential benefit to accepting a reasonable offer early rather than risking a worse outcome later.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - There is no current offer.\n   - I need to consider potential counteroffers and their value to me.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - I need to propose a counteroffer.\n\nLet's consider some potential counteroffers, keeping in mind my outside offer of 174. I want to maximize my value, so I want to keep items that I value highly (item 2 and item 3), while potentially giving away items that I value less (item 4). Since I have zero units of item 5, it doesn't make sense to offer any to the opponent, as it would signal to them its value and that I might accept less of something else.\n\nI'll start by constructing a counteroffer that gives a significant portion of the less valuable items to player 2. I need to ensure I retain enough items for the negotiation to be worthwhile, meaning my final payoff exceeds 174.\n\nI'll start by offering player 2 all of item 4.

This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 3, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    16 x 0 + 64 x 0 + 57 x 3 + 10 x 0 + 51 x 0\n    which is 171 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 174. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 2, 6, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 3, 3, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 3, 3, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action for Player 1 in round 2.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** 174\n*   **Item values:** item 1 = 16, item 2 = 64, item 3 = 57, item 4 = 10, item 5 = 51\n*   **Total items:** 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that accepting an offer in round 2 yields a value of 0.9 times the actual value of the items received. Waiting another round reduces the potential value further.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer (to Player 1):** [0, 0, 3, 3, 0]\n    This means Player 1 receives:\n    *   0 units of item 1\n    *   0 units of item 2\n    *   3 units of item 3\n    *   3 units of item 4\n    *   0 units of item 5\n    Value of current offer = (0 * 16) + (0 * 64) + (3 * 57) + (3 * 10) + (0 * 51) = 0 + 0 + 171 + 30 + 0 = 201\n    Discounted value of current offer = 201 * 0.9 = 180.9\n*   **Previous offer (to Player 2):** [0, 0, 2, 6, 0] means Player 1 would receive:\n    *   1 unit of item 1\n    *   1 unit of item 2\n    *   2 units of item 3\n    *   0 units of item 4\n    *   0 units of item 5\n    Value of previous offer for player 1 = (1 * 16) + (1 * 64) + (2 * 57) + (0 * 10) + (0 * 51) = 16 + 64 + 114 + 0 + 0 = 194\n    Discounted value of previous offer if accepted now = 194 * 0.9 = 174.6\n\n*   **Consider potential counteroffers:** We need an offer that is better than 174 for Player 1.\n    Player 2's offer in round 1 was [0, 0, 3, 3, 0] to Player 1. So Player 1 offered [0, 0, 2, 6, 0] in round 1.\n\n    If we give everything to Player 2: the items will be [1, 1, 4, 6, 0]. This would be really bad. Let's try to find an offer where Player 1 receives more than 174. The current discounted offer is 180.9 so maybe we can improve upon that? Let's start by considering the possibility that the current offer is already good and can improve upon past. The last offer to Player 1 was [0, 0, 3, 3, 0].\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer has a discounted value of 180.9, which is greater than the outside offer of 174. The previous offer that Player 1 made would provide a lower value of 174.6, so it would be a mistake (Mistake 1) to now offer that again to Player 2. The only way to ensure we get a payout for the round is to accept, or we can risk another round and get a discounted value. However, since the current offer is already better than the outside offer, there is no reason to risk another round since we are guaranteed 174. Since we are already over the outside offer, we should ACCEPT.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 2, 3, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    70 x 0 + 69 x 3 + 2 x 2 + 36 x 3 + 28 x 5\n    which is 459 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 460. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 4, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 4, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Current Situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 460\n*   Item values: Item 1 = 70, Item 2 = 69, Item 3 = 2, Item 4 = 36, Item 5 = 28\n*   Total items: 2 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 3 of item 4, 5 of item 5\n*   Discount factor: 0.9. This means any deal made in round 2 is worth 0.9 times the value of the items.\n\n2) **Value of Offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [0, 4, 0, 0, 0]. This means I receive 0 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5. My value would be: (0 * 70) + (4 * 69) + (0 * 2) + (0 * 36) + (0 * 28) = 276.  Since this is round 2, the discounted value is 276 * 0.9 = 248.4. This is much worse than my outside offer of 460.\n*   **Round 1 Offer:** Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] to Player 2. This means I would have received [1, 3, 2, 2, 4], so: (1 * 70) + (3 * 69) + (2 * 2) + (2 * 36) + (4 * 28) = 70 + 207 + 4 + 72 + 112 = 465. Round 1 discounted value: 465 * 1 = 465. This is better than my outside offer.\n*   **Round 2 Offer from Player 2:** Player 2 offered [0, 4, 0, 0, 0] to me. This means they get [2,0,3,3,5] so: (2 * 70) + (0 * 69) + (3 * 2) + (3 * 36) + (5 * 28) = 140 + 0 + 6 + 108 + 140 = 394.\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to find an offer that gives me a value greater than 460 / 0.9 = 511.11, so the counteroffer to Player 2 needs to be something which leaves me with items worth 511.11.\n    *   If I offer Player 2 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], I keep all items: (2 * 70) + (4 * 69) + (3 * 2) + (3 * 36) + (5 * 28) = 140 + 276 + 6 + 108 + 140 = 670. My discounted value = 670 * 0.9 = 603 > 460.\n        This is the best possible deal.\n    *   Let's try to leave player 2 with one item 1, three items 2, two items 3, two items 4, and four items 5, by keeping all of the rest: (70 * (2-1)) + (69 * (4-3)) + (2*(3-2)) + (36 * (3-2)) + (28*(5-4)) = 70 + 69 + 2 + 36 + 28 = 205. The other way around it is: (70*1) + (69*3) + (2*2) + (36*2) + (28*4) = 70 + 207 + 4 + 72 + 112 = 465.\n    *   If I offer Player 2 [1, 0, 1, 1, 1], I keep [1, 4, 2, 2, 4], so: (1 * 70) + (4 * 69) + (2 * 2) + (2 * 36) + (4 * 28) = 70 + 276 + 4 + 72 + 112 = 534. Discounted value = 534*0.9 = 480.6.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\nThe current offer is bad. My outside offer is 460. Offering [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] to Player 2 yields the highest value. Offering [1, 0, 1, 1, 1] to Player 2 yields value of 480.6 which is better than 460.\nI should make a counteroffer that will allow me to reach a value better than 460.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 966. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 957 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 4, 3, 3, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    28 x 1 + 58 x 4 + 85 x 3 + 82 x 3 + 66 x 3\n    which is 959 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 966.
