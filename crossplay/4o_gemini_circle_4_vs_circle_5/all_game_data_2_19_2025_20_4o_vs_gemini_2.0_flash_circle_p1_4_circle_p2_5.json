Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 142. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 912 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

Since we are in Round 1, there is no discount applied yet.\n\n2) **Assessing the Value of Offers:**\n\n   - **Current Offer Value**: There is no current offer to evaluate.\n\n   - **Potential Counteroffer Values:**\n     - I need to make sure any offer I propose gives me a value greater than my outside offer value (142) to avoid Mistake 2.\n     - Let's evaluate a potential counteroffer that can maximize my value. A reasonable initial offer could be offering Player 2 minimal value items, primarily focusing on keeping high value items for myself.\n\n   - **Counteroffer Evaluation:**\n     - For instance, if we propose giving Player 2:\n       - 1 unit of item 1\n       - 0 units of item 2\n       - 2 units of item 3\n       - 0 units of item 4\n       - 5 units of item 5\n\n     - We keep:\n       - 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 42 = 126\n       - 3 units of item 2: 3 \u00d7 99 = 297\n       - 5 units of item 3: 5 \u00d7 72 = 360\n       - 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 87 = 174\n       - 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 4 = 4\n\n     - Total Value for Me: 126 + 297 + 360 + 174 + 4 = 961\n\n3) **Making a Decision:**\n   - The total value of the potential counteroffer to me is 961, which is significantly greater than my outside offer value of 142.\n   - This avoids Mistake 2 (making an offer worse for me than my outside offer) and maximizes my current value without making an extreme initial offer.\n\nGiven this analysis, my decision is to propose the counteroffer to Player 2, as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 2, 0, 5]}\n```",

For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 3, 7, 2, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    60 x 2 + 12 x 3 + 26 x 7 + 38 x 2 + 67 x 5\n    which is 749 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 750. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 2, 0, 5]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 2, 0, 5]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 750.\n   - My values for the items are: item 1 = 60, item 2 = 12, item 3 = 26, item 4 = 38, item 5 = 67.\n   - The total pool of items is: 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor is 0.9. This means that waiting for a future offer reduces the value by 10% per round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer: Player 1 offers me [1, 0, 2, 0, 5]. This means I get:\n     - 1 unit of item 1: 1 * 60 = 60\n     - 0 units of item 2: 0 * 12 = 0\n     - 2 units of item 3: 2 * 26 = 52\n     - 0 units of item 4: 0 * 38 = 0\n     - 5 units of item 5: 5 * 67 = 335\n     - Total value of current offer: 60 + 0 + 52 + 0 + 335 = 447\n   - The current offer is worth 447 to me. This is less than my outside offer of 750.\n\nNow let's consider making a counteroffer. I need to keep enough items so that the total value is greater than 750.\nI have the following items: 4 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 7 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 6 of item 5.\n\nLet's try offering Player 1 only 1 unit of item 3. This would mean I keep 4 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 6 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 6 of item 5.\n\nMy value would then be:\n(4 * 60) + (3 * 12) + (6 * 26) + (2 * 38) + (6 * 67) = 240 + 36 + 156 + 76 + 402 = 910\n\nThis is better than my outside offer of 750. I could likely make a more generous offer, but I want to start with an offer that is certainly acceptable to me.\n\nSo, I will offer Player 1 [0, 0, 1, 0, 0].\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - The current offer is worse than my outside offer.\n   - My counteroffer will result in a value of 910 which is better than my outside offer.\n   - Therefore, I should make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]}\n```",

This means that any value from the negotiation result in the current round should be multiplied by 0.9 to reflect its discounted value to me.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n\n   - **Current Offer to Me:** [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n     - My total value if I accept this offer:\n       - Item 3: 1 \u00d7 72 = 72\n     - Total value = 72\n     - Discounted value = 72 \u00d7 0.9 = 64.8\n\n   - **Compare the offer value to my outside offer:**\n     - The discounted value of accepting is 64.8, which is less than my outside offer value of 142.\n\n3) **Decision Making:**\n\n   - Accepting the current offer would yield a value of 64.8, which is less than my outside offer of 142. I should not accept this offer.\n   - Walking away would secure the outside offer value of 142 for me. However, I still have an opportunity to make a counteroffer where the potential acceptance on my terms could exceed my outside offer value, so I should explore this option.\n   \n   - Propose a counteroffer that prioritizes maximizing my value above my outside offer while ensuring it is not significantly detrimental to Player 2.\n     - I want to keep the high-value items for me and offer lower-value items to Player 2.\n\n   To maximize value:\n   - Ideal for me would be to hold onto as many high-value items as possible, like item 2 and 4, while giving away items of lower value to me, such as item 5.\n\n   Possible counteroffer to Player 2: [0, 0, 2, 0, 5]\n   - This gives them all of the units of item 5 and allows them an additional unit of item 3, making a better proposal by increasing their units slightly from the previous time they wanted only 1 unit of item 3.\n\n- **Value calculation for me if counteroffer is accepted:**\n  - My share: [4, 3, 5, 2, 1]\n    - Item 1: 4 \u00d7 42 = 168\n    - Item 2: 3 \u00d7 99 = 297\n    - Item 3: 5 \u00d7 72 = 360\n    - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 87 = 174\n    - Item 5: 1 \u00d7 4 = 4\n  - Total = 168 + 297 + 360 + 174 + 4 = 1003\n  \n  Total value with discount if accepted this round = 1003 \u00d7 0.9 = 902.7, which is far greater than my outside offer of 142.\n\nGiven this calculation, my action is to propose a reasonable counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 2, 0, 5]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 3, 7, 2, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    60 x 2 + 12 x 3 + 26 x 7 + 38 x 2 + 67 x 5\n    which is 749 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 750. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 2, 0, 5]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 2, 0, 5]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 2, 0, 5]\n\n    What is your action?

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis.

For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 4, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    17 x 0 + 73 x 0 + 17 x 0 + 9 x 4 + 17 x 2\n    which is 70 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 73. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value: 73\n   - My item values: item 1 = 17, item 2 = 73, item 3 = 17, item 4 = 9, item 5 = 17\n   - Total items: 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5.\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means an offer accepted in a later round is worth less than the same offer accepted now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [1, 0, 5, 0, 0]. This means I get 1 unit of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n      - Value of current offer: (1 * 17) + (0 * 73) + (5 * 17) + (0 * 9) + (0 * 17) = 17 + 0 + 85 + 0 + 0 = 102\n      - Since 102 > 73, accepting the current offer is better than walking away.\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** Let's consider a few potential counteroffers and their values to me.\n       - Keeping all items: 4 * 17 + 4 * 73 + 5 * 17 + 4 * 9 + 2 * 17 = 68 + 292 + 85 + 36 + 34 = 515\n       - Offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] to Player 1: I keep everything, value = 515\n       - Offer [4, 4, 5, 4, 2] to Player 1: I keep nothing, value = 0\n       - Offer [2, 2, 2, 2, 1] to Player 1: I keep 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4 and 1 unit of item 5. Value = 2*17 + 2*73 + 3*17 + 2*9 + 1*17 = 34 + 146 + 51 + 18 + 17 = 266.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   - The current offer is worth 102, which is greater than my outside offer of 73. Therefore, accepting the offer is a good option.\n   - However, before I accept, I should consider if a counteroffer could yield a higher value, taking into account the discount factor. Since this is round 1, the discount factor is 1, so it doesn't affect the immediate value.\n   - I believe there is room for a counteroffer that could get me a higher value than 102. Since the total value of all items to me is 515, I'd ideally like to get closer to that value.\n\nLet's propose a counteroffer. I want to make an offer that gives me a good value, while also being potentially acceptable to Player 1. Let's aim for splitting the total value roughly in half. I will propose to give Player 1: [2, 2, 3, 2, 1]. This means I keep 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n\nMy value for this counteroffer is:\n(2 * 17) + (2 * 73) + (2 * 17) + (2 * 9) + (1 * 17) = 34 + 146 + 34 + 18 + 17 = 249\nSince 249 is much greater than 73, and greater than the current offer of 102, this seems like a good counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 3, 2, 1]}\n```",

For example, if my counter-offer were to keep more units of items 2, 4, and 5 which hold higher values for me, it could increase my total value.\n\n     Let's propose a counteroffer that I have more of the items highly valued by me while still ensuring it could be more appealing to Player 2:\n\n     Proposed Counteroffer to Player 2: [1, 3, 4, 1, 0]\n     - Value to me:\n       - Item 1: 3 units \u00d7 4 = 12\n       - Item 2: 1 unit \u00d7 29 = 29\n       - Item 3: 1 unit \u00d7 1 = 1\n       - Item 4: 3 units \u00d7 97 = 291\n       - Item 5: 2 units \u00d7 62 = 124\n       - Total Value = 457\n       - After discount: 457 \u00d7 0.9 = 411.3\n\n    This is still less than my outside value but at least suggests a more favorable outcome potentially in further negotiations within this round.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n   Given the current situation, accepting the current offer does not yield a satisfactory value, and walking away would guarantee my outside value of 626. I will propose a counteroffer that aligns better with my valuation logic while still aiming for a potentially acceptable negotiation for Player 2.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 3, 4, 1, 0]}\n```",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 73. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 73. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 399 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 4, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    17 x 0 + 73 x 0 + 17 x 0 + 9 x 4 + 17 x 2\n    which is 70 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 73. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 5, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 2, 3, 2, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 4, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 3, 4, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 73\n*   My item values: item 1 = 17, item 2 = 73, item 3 = 17, item 4 = 9, item 5 = 17\n*   Total items: item 1 = 4, item 2 = 4, item 3 = 5, item 4 = 4, item 5 = 2\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means accepting an offer now is worth more than accepting a slightly better offer next round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [1, 3, 4, 1, 0]. This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 4 - 1 = 3\n    *   Item 2: 4 - 3 = 1\n    *   Item 3: 5 - 4 = 1\n    *   Item 4: 4 - 1 = 3\n    *   Item 5: 2 - 0 = 2\n    *   My value: (3 * 17) + (1 * 73) + (1 * 17) + (3 * 9) + (2 * 17) = 51 + 73 + 17 + 27 + 34 = 202\n*   Since it's round 2, the discounted value of this offer would be 202 * (0.9^(2-1)) = 202 * 0.9 = 181.8\n\n*   **Comparison to Outside Offer:** The current offer (181.8) is much better than my outside offer (73).\n\nNow let's consider a counteroffer. To avoid mistake 2, any counteroffer should ensure that what I keep is worth more than 73.\n\nHere is my previous offer: [2, 2, 3, 2, 1] to player 1. Which means that I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 4 - 2 = 2\n    *   Item 2: 4 - 2 = 2\n    *   Item 3: 5 - 3 = 2\n    *   Item 4: 4 - 2 = 2\n    *   Item 5: 2 - 1 = 1\n    *   My value: (2 * 17) + (2 * 73) + (2 * 17) + (2 * 9) + (1 * 17) = 34 + 146 + 34 + 18 + 17 = 249\n*   Since it's round 1, the discounted value of this offer would be 249 * (0.9^(1-1)) = 249 * 1 = 249\n\nLet's think about how player 1 values these items. I don't know, but if I gave them more items, then I would get closer to my walk-away.\n\nLet's analyze some possible counteroffers:\nIf I offer player 1 [1, 3, 4, 1, 0] as they did to me, I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 4 - 1 = 3\n    *   Item 2: 4 - 3 = 1\n    *   Item 3: 5 - 4 = 1\n    *   Item 4: 4 - 1 = 3\n    *   Item 5: 2 - 0 = 2\n    *   My value: (3 * 17) + (1 * 73) + (1 * 17) + (3 * 9) + (2 * 17) = 51 + 73 + 17 + 27 + 34 = 202\n*   Since it's round 2, the discounted value of this offer would be 202 * (0.9^(2-1)) = 202 * 0.9 = 181.8\n\nIf I offer player 1 [0, 4, 5, 0, 0], then I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 4 - 0 = 4\n    *   Item 2: 4 - 4 = 0\n    *   Item 3: 5 - 5 = 0\n    *   Item 4: 4 - 0 = 4\n    *   Item 5: 2 - 0 = 2\n    *   My value: (4 * 17) + (0 * 73) + (0 * 17) + (4 * 9) + (2 * 17) = 68 + 0 + 0 + 36 + 34 = 138\n*   Since it's round 2, the discounted value of this offer would be 138 * (0.9^(2-1)) = 138 * 0.9 = 124.2\n\nIf I offer player 1 [2, 3, 4, 1, 1], then I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 4 - 2 = 2\n    *   Item 2: 4 - 3 = 1\n    *   Item 3: 5 - 4 = 1\n    *   Item 4: 4 - 1 = 3\n    *   Item 5: 2 - 1 = 1\n    *   My value: (2 * 17) + (1 * 73) + (1 * 17) + (3 * 9) + (1 * 17) = 34 + 73 + 17 + 27 + 17 = 168\n*   Since it's round 2, the discounted value of this offer would be 168 * (0.9^(2-1)) = 168 * 0.9 = 151.2\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer gives me a discounted value of 181.8, which is better than my outside offer.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 435. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 492 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 6, 1, 6, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    6 x 0 + 66 x 6 + 32 x 1 + 1 x 6 + 59 x 0\n    which is 434 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 435. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 1, 5, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 1, 5, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step to determine the best action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** 435\n*   **Item values:** Item 1 = 6, Item 2 = 66, Item 3 = 32, Item 4 = 1, Item 5 = 59\n*   **Total items:** 2 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 10 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [0, 2, 1, 5, 1]. This means I get 0 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5. The value to me is:\n    (0 * 6) + (2 * 66) + (1 * 32) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 59) = 0 + 132 + 32 + 5 + 59 = 228.\n    Since 228 < 435, accepting this offer is worse than my outside offer.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to calculate the value of different counteroffers and compare them to my outside offer. I have to keep in mind that I have a total of [2, 6, 2, 10, 2] items.\n\nLet's consider keeping all the items for myself. This would give me:\n(2 * 6) + (6 * 66) + (2 * 32) + (10 * 1) + (2 * 59) = 12 + 396 + 64 + 10 + 118 = 600.\nThis is my maximum possible value.\n\nNow, let's consider a counteroffer where I offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] to Player 1. This means I keep everything. The value is 600, which is greater than my outside offer of 435.\n\nLet's consider offering Player 1 half of everything, rounded down: offer [1, 3, 1, 5, 1]. This would leave me with [1, 3, 1, 5, 1].  The value to me is (1 * 6) + (3 * 66) + (1 * 32) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 59) = 6 + 198 + 32 + 5 + 59 = 300. This is less than my outside offer.\n\nTo make a useful counteroffer, I need to make sure my remaining items are worth more than 435. I can't give away too much.\n\nI need to find a division that gives me a value greater than 435. Let's try to give away mainly items I don't value much. I could try giving away all the item 4. Offering [2, 6, 2, 10, 2] to Player 1 would mean I keep [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. That's not going to work.\n\nLet's try offering Player 1: [0, 1, 0, 5, 0]. This leaves me with [2, 5, 2, 5, 2]. The value to me is: (2 * 6) + (5 * 66) + (2 * 32) + (5 * 1) + (2 * 59) = 12 + 330 + 64 + 5 + 118 = 529.  529 > 435.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is worth 228, which is less than my outside offer of 435. Therefore, I should not accept it. I can make a counteroffer that gives Player 1 [0, 1, 0, 5, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 5, 0]}\n```",

This means that accepting an offer now is worth more than accepting the same offer in a later round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 3, 0, 8, 1]. This means I would receive:\n      - 1 unit of item 1\n      - 3 units of item 2\n      - 0 units of item 3\n      - 8 units of item 4\n      - 1 unit of item 5\n      My value for this offer is: (1 * 6) + (3 * 66) + (0 * 32) + (8 * 1) + (1 * 59) = 6 + 198 + 0 + 8 + 59 = 271\n\n   - **Compare to outside offer:** The current offer (271) is less than my outside offer (435).\n\n   - **Consider a potential counteroffer:** I need to find an offer that gives me a value greater than 435. I have 2 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 10 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 in total.\n\n   Let's try to calculate the value I get if I keep everything except item 1 and item 4:\n    -  Keeping 2 units of item 1: 2 * 6 = 12\n    -  Keeping 6 units of item 2: 6 * 66 = 396\n    -  Keeping 2 units of item 3: 2 * 32 = 64\n    -  Keeping 10 units of item 4: 10 * 1 = 10\n    -  Keeping 2 units of item 5: 2 * 59 = 118\n     = 12 + 396 + 64 + 10 + 118 = 600\n\n   Let's examine the previous offers.\n\n    - Round 1 Offer to Player 1: [0, 1, 0, 5, 0]\n    - Round 1 Offer to Player 2: [0, 2, 1, 5, 1]\n    - Round 2 Offer to Player 1: [1, 3, 0, 8, 1]\n\n    Given the negotiation history, it seems Player 1 values item 4 highly. My value for item 4 is very low. I could try offering player 1 all of item 4 to get them to give me more of item 2, which I value highly.\n\n    I will try offering player 1 all of item 1, item 3, item 4, and one unit of item 5, keeping all of item 2 and one unit of item 5 for myself. This gives me:\n\n    -  Keeping 0 units of item 1: 0 * 6 = 0\n    -  Keeping 6 units of item 2: 6 * 66 = 396\n    -  Keeping 0 units of item 3: 0 * 32 = 0\n    -  Keeping 0 units of item 4: 0 * 1 = 0\n    -  Keeping 1 unit of item 5: 1 * 59 = 59\n     = 0 + 396 + 0 + 0 + 59 = 455\n\n    This is greater than my outside offer. The corresponding offer to player 1 is [2, 0, 2, 10, 1]\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is worse than my outside offer, so I should not accept it. I will make a counteroffer that benefits me more than my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 2, 10, 1]}\n```",

Assess the value of offers:\n- **Current Offer:** There is no current offer to consider from Player 2.\n- **Potential Counteroffers:** We need to propose a division where my total value remains above 152.\n\n### 3. Strategy for Counteroffer:\nTo maximize my value and make a rational counteroffer, I will try to keep high-value items.

For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 1, 7, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    17 x 2 + 90 x 0 + 78 x 1 + 63 x 7 + 39 x 2\n    which is 631 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 632. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 3, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 0, 3, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** 632\n*   **Item values:** Item 1: 17, Item 2: 90, Item 3: 78, Item 4: 63, Item 5: 39\n*   **Total items:** Item 1: 3, Item 2: 1, Item 3: 2, Item 4: 7, Item 5: 3\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that accepting an offer in a later round is worth less than accepting it now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 1, 0, 3, 1]. This means I would get:\n    *   Item 1: 1 unit, value = 1 * 17 = 17\n    *   Item 2: 1 unit, value = 1 * 90 = 90\n    *   Item 3: 0 units, value = 0 * 78 = 0\n    *   Item 4: 3 units, value = 3 * 63 = 189\n    *   Item 5: 1 unit, value = 1 * 39 = 39\n    *   Total value = 17 + 90 + 0 + 189 + 39 = 335\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (335) is much less than my outside offer (632). Therefore, I should not accept this offer.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I want to make a counteroffer that is worth more than 632. I currently possess:\n    *   Item 1: 2 units (3 total - 1 offered = 2). Value = 2*17 = 34\n    *   Item 2: 0 units (1 total - 1 offered = 0). Value = 0*90 = 0\n    *   Item 3: 2 units (2 total - 0 offered = 2). Value = 2*78 = 156\n    *   Item 4: 4 units (7 total - 3 offered = 4). Value = 4*63 = 252\n    *   Item 5: 2 units (3 total - 1 offered = 2). Value = 2*39 = 78\n    *   Total = 34 + 0 + 156 + 252 + 78 = 520\n\n    This is obviously less than 632. I need to offer less to Player 1. Let's try to formulate a reasonable counteroffer. I want to keep item 2, item 3, item 4. And try to get item 1 and item 5.\n    Let's try offering [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I keep everything.\n    *Item 1: 3*17 = 51\n    *Item 2: 1*90 = 90\n    *Item 3: 2*78 = 156\n    *Item 4: 7*63 = 441\n    *Item 5: 3*39 = 117\n    Total: 855 > 632\n    Now let's try to make it reasonable for Player 1. Offer them [0, 0, 0, 3, 1] again as a start. Then my items become:\n        *Item 1: 3*17 = 51\n        *Item 2: 1*90 = 90\n        *Item 3: 2*78 = 156\n        *Item 4: 4*63 = 252\n        *Item 5: 2*39 = 78\n        Total: 627. Which is < 632, not acceptable.\n    \n    I need to give away less. I'm going to give Player 1 [0,0,0,2,0].\n    * Item 1: 3 * 17 = 51\n    * Item 2: 1 * 90 = 90\n    * Item 3: 2 * 78 = 156\n    * Item 4: 5 * 63 = 315\n    * Item 5: 3 * 39 = 117\n    Total = 729\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\nI will make a counteroffer. I will offer Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 2, 0]. This leaves me with a value of 729 which is higher than my outside option of 632.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 2, 0]}\n```",

We are in round 2, so any agreement now is multiplied by 1 (gamma^0).\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n\n   - **Current Offer on the Table:** [0, 0, 0, 2, 0] \n     - Value to me:\n       - Item 4: 2 units \u00d7 29 = 58\n     - Total Value if I Accept Current Offer = 58\n   \n   - **Potential Counteroffer:** I have to ensure that any counteroffer gives me a total value of greater than 152 to beat my outside offer. Let's explore a potential counteroffer. I'll consider offering Player 2 the minimum amount that maximizes my value.\n\n     - Offer Player 2: [0, 0, 0, 2, 0]\n     - I keep (current counteroffer option):\n       - [3, 1, 2, 5, 3]\n       - My value calculation:\n         - Item 1: 3 \u00d7 50 = 150\n         - Item 2: 1 \u00d7 29 = 29\n         - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 65 = 130\n         - Item 4: 5 \u00d7 29 = 145\n         - Item 5: 3 \u00d7 71 = 213\n       - Total Value = 667\n\n   - **Compare with My Outside Offer:** Any counteroffer must provide more than 152. Keeping most items would boost my outcome significantly compared to both the current offer and my outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a Decision:**\n\n   - **Accept the Current Offer?** No, the value of 58 is less than my outside offer of 152.\n   - **Walk Away?** Not yet; there might still be potential to craft a better outcome than my outside offer.\n   - **Propose a Counteroffer:** I should maximize my retained items while still trying to motivate Player 2 to agree. Given the offer history, I propose largely sharing items evenly, except I seek a larger share of high-value items from my perspective.\n\n   By retaining more and optimizing my potential gain, I am maximizing my position and encouraging agreement because Player 2 must weigh this against their own outside offer.\n\n   Here, my counteroffer equation:\n   - Allocating substantial items still but optimizing high-values.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 3, 1]}",

It would be a mistake to accept.\n- **Walk Away**: Walking away guarantees a value of 152.\n- **Counteroffer**: Any counteroffer must be made to maximize my value while ensuring it's better than my outside offer felt in round 3 context (considering previous offers to avoid mistake 1).\n\n#### Evaluate potential counteroffer:\nI can attempt a fair division aiming to maximize my remaining value while making it appealing enough for Player 2 to accept. \n\nGiven we are in the last round and considering the current situation:\n- Trying to keep as much high-value item for me where possible.\n\nPropose: \n- Offer Player 2 something similar to my previous offer to signal consistency and fairness: [1, 0, 1, 3, 1].\n\nEvaluated value for me if this counteroffer is accepted:\n- My retained units: [2, 1, 1, 4, 2]\n  - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 50 = 100\n  - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 29 = 29\n  - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 65 = 65\n  - 4 units of item 4 = 4 \u00d7 29 = 116\n  - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 71 = 142\n- Total unadjusted value = 452\n- Adjusted value = 452 \u00d7 0.81 = 366.12\n\nSince 366.12 > 152, this potential counteroffer is better than just walking away.\n\n#### Decision:\nGiven the above analysis, I will propose a counteroffer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 3, 1]}",

My target should be to get at least a value that is better than my outside offer of 268.\n\n3) Make a decision:\n   - I plan an initial counteroffer where I keep items with high value to me.\n   - Let's consider proposing an offer where Player 2 gets 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5.\n\nLet's calculate my total value for keeping the remaining items:\n- Item 1: 4 units \u00d7 94 = 376\n- Item 2: 1 unit \u00d7 20 = 20\n- Item 3: 2 units \u00d7 51 = 102\n- Item 4: 2 units \u00d7 34 = 68\n- Item 5: 4 units \u00d7 64 = 256\n- Total value retained: 376 + 20 + 102 + 68 + 256 = 822\n\nThis offer gives me a total value of 822, which is significantly better than my outside offer value of 268. Therefore, this is a suitable counteroffer to make while ensuring a fair division to incentivize Player 2 to accept the deal.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 1, 2, 4]}",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 2, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    41 x 0 + 88 x 0 + 74 x 1 + 83 x 2 + 40 x 4\n    which is 400 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 401. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 1, 2, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 1, 2, 4]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best course of action.\n\n1) **Analysis of the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 401\n*   My values for the items: 41 (item 1), 88 (item 2), 74 (item 3), 83 (item 4), 40 (item 5)\n*   Total pool of items: 4 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 8 units of item 5.\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its face value, and in round 3, it's worth 0.81 times its face value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of the current offer:**\n\nThe current offer gives me:\n*   Item 1: 4 - 0 = 4 units\n*   Item 2: 2 - 1 = 1 unit\n*   Item 3: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n*   Item 4: 4 - 2 = 2 units\n*   Item 5: 8 - 4 = 4 units\n\nMy value for this offer:\n(4 * 41) + (1 * 88) + (2 * 74) + (2 * 83) + (4 * 40) = 164 + 88 + 148 + 166 + 160 = 726\n\nSince 726 is greater than my outside offer of 401, accepting is better than walking away *at this round*.\n\n3) **Consider a counteroffer**\nGiven it's round 1, I could attempt to get more items. Since accepting the current offer is better than my outside offer, I should make sure that any counteroffer I send leads to something that's at least as good, or better than my outside offer.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I give player 1 [0,0,0,0,0].\nThis gives me:\n4 * 41 + 2 * 88 + 3 * 74 + 4 * 83 + 8 * 40 = 164 + 176 + 222 + 332 + 320 = 1214\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I give player 1 [1,0,0,0,0].\nThis gives me:\n3 * 41 + 2 * 88 + 3 * 74 + 4 * 83 + 8 * 40 = 123 + 176 + 222 + 332 + 320 = 1173\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I give player 1 [0,0,1,0,0].\nThis gives me:\n4 * 41 + 2 * 88 + 2 * 74 + 4 * 83 + 8 * 40 = 164 + 176 + 148 + 332 + 320 = 1140\n\nThe current offer is worth 726. If I delay, its value next round is reduced to 726 * 0.9 = 653.4\nIf the offer is delayed by two rounds its value is reduced to 726 * 0.81 = 588.06\n\nIt makes sense to try to get more items, while taking into consideration the discount factor.

Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 1, 2, 4]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 1, 3, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 1, 3, 4]\n\n    What is your action?

This means that an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 0.9^2 = 0.81 times its face value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 1, 1, 3, 4]. This means I would receive:\n    *   0 units of item 1\n    *   1 unit of item 2\n    *   1 unit of item 3\n    *   3 units of item 4\n    *   4 units of item 5\n    My value for this offer would be: (0 * 41) + (1 * 88) + (1 * 74) + (3 * 83) + (4 * 40) = 0 + 88 + 74 + 249 + 160 = 571\n    Since this is round 2, the discounted value is 571 * 0.9 = 513.9. This is significantly higher than my outside offer of 401.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** It's worth exploring some counteroffers, but I need to be mindful of the discount factor in the final round.\n\n    *   Let's consider a counteroffer where I offer Player 1 only item 5: [4, 2, 3, 4, 8].\n    * I would receive nothing. This is worth 0 which is worse than the outside offer.\n    * Let's consider keeping everything.\n    * My value would be 4 * 41 + 2 * 88 + 3 * 74 + 4 * 83 + 8 * 40 = 164 + 176 + 222 + 332 + 320 = 1214. This is my maximum possible value.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer gives me a value of 571, which, after the discount factor, is 513.9. This is much higher than my outside offer.\n*   It might be beneficial to try and get a slightly better offer, but if I counteroffer and Player 1 rejects, then I walk away with 401.\n\nSince I want to maximize my value, the best action is to ACCEPT the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 2, 2, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 2, 2, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

With 2 rounds completed, we use gamma^(r-1) for this round which doesn't influence this round calculation but impacts the payoff in round 3.\n\n2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n   - **Current Offer Value if Accepted:** The current offer gives me [3, 2, 2, 1, 0]. Calculate the value:\n     - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63\n     - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 24 = 48\n     - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 78 = 156\n     - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 7 = 7\n     - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 92 = 0\n     - Total Value = 63 + 48 + 156 + 7 + 0 = 274\n   - **Comparison to Outside Offer:** 274 (current offer value) < 305 (outside offer). The current offer is worse than my outside offer.\n   \n3) Make a Decision:\n   - I should not accept this current offer because it is less valuable than my outside offer.\n   - I should also not walk because I can make a counteroffer.\n\nNow, I need to create a counteroffer that gives me a total value higher than my outside offer of 305. Let's maximize my value while providing a feasible split:\n\nConsidering the total pool of items again:\n   - Offer Player 2: [1, 1, 3, 1, 3]\n   - Calculate my retained value:\n     - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 21 = 42\n     - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 24 = 24\n     - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 78 = 78\n     - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 7 = 7\n     - 4 units of item 5 = 4 \u00d7 92 = 368\n     - Total Value = 42 + 24 + 78 + 7 + 368 = 519\n\nThis proposed counteroffer gives me a much higher total value than my outside offer.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Therefore, accepting is not viable.\n   - Walking away gives a guaranteed value of 305.\n   - A counteroffer could potentially surpass my outside offer value.\n\nLet's consider a potential counteroffer.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 4, 0, 7] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    42 x 0 + 11 x 2 + 21 x 4 + 82 x 0 + 94 x 7\n    which is 764 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 766. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To decide on my action in this first round of negotiation, let's go through the evaluation step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **My Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer value is 146.\n- **Values of the Items**:\n  - Item 1: 1\n  - Item 2: 95\n  - Item 3: 88\n  - Item 4: 70\n  - Item 5: 43\n- **Total Pool of Items**:\n  - 4 units of item 1\n  - 3 units of item 2\n  - 4 units of item 3\n  - 1 unit of item 4\n  - 6 units of item 5\n- **Discount Factor Influence**: Since we're in the first of potentially three rounds, there is not yet a discount applied. After each round beyond this one, the value will be discounted by 0.9^1 and further for subsequent rounds which influence the negotiation dynamics.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer**: There is no current offer on the table.\n- **Potential Counteroffers**:\n  - I need to make an offer that ensures the value I keep for myself is greater than my outside offer of 146, and ideally as high as possible.\n\n### Calculating Values\n\nLet's consider keeping negotiable units that maximize my value while proposing only a small amount to Player 2. I will aim to retain high-value items based on my private valuation:\n\n#### For me to propose a counteroffer:\n\n1. If I were to keep 0 units for Player 2, my total value of keeping everything is:\n   - 4 units of item 1 = \\(4 \\times 1 = 4\\)\n   - 3 units of item 2 = \\(3 \\times 95 = 285\\)\n   - 4 units of item 3 = \\(4 \\times 88 = 352\\)\n   - 1 unit of item 4 = \\(1 \\times 70 = 70\\)\n   - 6 units of item 5 = \\(6 \\times 43 = 258\\)\n   - **Total Value for me if I keep all items** = 969\n\nHowever, proposing such a division and keeping everything violates mistake 3: offering no items.\n\n2. To make a reasonable counteroffer, I will propose:\n   - Give 4 units of item 1 to Player 2 since its value to me is low.\n   - Give 0 units of Item 2 and Item 3, ensuring I maintain high-value items for me.\n   - Give 0 units of Item 4 to maximize my high value.\n   - Give some share of Item 5 which balances value but ensures the deal's attractiveness.\n\nHere's a structured offer calculation based on the above goal:\n\n- Offer to Player 2:\n  - 4 units of item 1 (entirely given)\n  - 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4.\n  - 3 of 6 units of item 5\n\nThe above offer gives:\n- For Player 2: \n  - 4 units of item 1 = 4 \\((assuming Player 2 has random valuations)\\)\n  - 3 units of item 5 = \\(3 \\times 43 = 129\\)\n\n- For Me:\n  - Don\u2019t know exact value for Player 2, but I retain critical high-value items helping me exceed the fallback option.\n\nThe value I keep:\n\n- 3 \\(units of item 5 \\equiv 3 \\times 43 = 129\\), keeping some value spread.\n- Total in my hand is vastly over 146 discounted in future rounds.\n\n### Step 3: Decision\n\nGiven this evaluation, I want the best starting offer understanding of these terms for sure high points, not offering everything or nothing in callable rounds, and not walking and leaving accepting better possibilities later.\n\nTherefore, I'll make this as my **COUNTEROFFER**:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 0, 0, 0, 3]}\n```\nWhich actively engages Player 2, taking cross-balances to negotiated choices with expected forms of shared rounds.",

For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    72 x 0 + 32 x 0 + 19 x 0 + 17 x 0 + 43 x 1\n    which is 43 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 49. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This means I get 4 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 unit of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 49. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 549 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    72 x 0 + 32 x 0 + 19 x 0 + 17 x 0 + 43 x 1\n    which is 43 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 49. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [4, 0, 0, 0, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 1, 0, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 1, 0, 4]\n\n    What is your action?

This means that offers in later rounds are worth less to both players.\n\n2.  **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n    *   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [2, 1, 1, 0, 4]. This means I would receive:\n        *   2 units of item 1: 2 * 72 = 144\n        *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 32 = 32\n        *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 19 = 19\n        *   0 units of item 4: 0 * 17 = 0\n        *   4 units of item 5: 4 * 43 = 172\n        *   Total value = 144 + 32 + 19 + 0 + 172 = 367\n\n        Since it is round 2, I should multiply the total value by gamma^(2-1) = gamma^1 = 0.9\n        Discounted total value = 367 * 0.9 = 330.3\n        \n    *   The current offer is worth 330.3 to me, which is significantly higher than my outside offer of 49. So, Mistakes 4 and 5 are not currently relevant.\n    *   Since this round is round 2, there's one round left after this one (if I choose to make a counteroffer, it will be treated as a WALK). \n    *   It's important that I propose an offer that is not worse than my previous offer and that I make sure that the offer has a value higher than my outside option (Mistakes 1 and 2).\n    *   It's important that I don't offer all the items to Player 1 since that would be suboptimal (Mistake 3).\n\n    *Let's consider a possible counteroffer: Offer the minimal amount necessary to make a worthwhile profit on the counter offer.*\n    *Counteroffer:* To arrive at the best counteroffer I need to identify what is valuable to me, and see if I can reduce my offer on those items.\n        * I value Item 1 (72), and Item 5 (43) the most. Player 1 is currently offering me 2 of Item 1 and 4 of Item 5. \n        * I will consider offering 3 of Item 1, and 5 of Item 5. \n        * The other items are less valuable so I will offer those items in exchange. \n        * Let's formulate a proposal that gives Player 1: [3, 2, 2, 1, 5]\n        * This leaves me with:\n            * 1 unit of item 1: 1 * 72 = 72\n            * 1 unit of item 2: 1 * 32 = 32\n            * 2 unit of item 3: 2 * 19 = 38\n            * 0 unit of item 4: 0 * 17 = 0\n            * 1 unit of item 5: 1 * 43 = 43\n            * Total value = 72 + 32 + 38 + 0 + 43 = 185\n            * Discounted value = 185 * 0.9 = 166.5\n        * While my outside offer is 49, I'm still in the bargaining game. I want to see if I can get better value. I want to give Player 1 3 Units of Item 1, 2 Units of Item 2, 2 Units of Item 3, 1 Unit of Item 4, and 5 Units of Item 5. This would be a better offer than my outside option, but less than my current offer.\n\n3.  **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n    *   The current offer provides significant value (330.3) compared to my outside offer (49). It's much more than my outside offer.\n    *   The counteroffer above has a discounted value of 166.5\n    *   Therefore, accepting the current offer maximizes my value.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

This means that an offer accepted in a later round is worth less than the same offer accepted now.\n\n2.  **Assess the value of the current offer and potential counteroffers:**\n\n    *   **Current offer:** I am offered \\[1, 0, 0, 2, 2]. This means I receive:\n        *   1 unit of Item 1: 1 * 76 = 76\n        *   0 units of Item 2: 0 * 67 = 0\n        *   0 units of Item 3: 0 * 18 = 0\n        *   2 units of Item 4: 2 * 27 = 54\n        *   2 units of Item 5: 2 * 71 = 142\n        *   Total value of current offer: 76 + 0 + 0 + 54 + 142 = 272\n\n    *   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (272) is greater than my outside offer (192).\n\n    *   **Consider some potential counteroffers:** I need to make sure any counteroffer gives me a value greater than 192. Let's consider a more balanced split. Player 1's current offer implies I get:\n        *Item 1: 1, Item 2: 0, Item 3: 0, Item 4: 2, Item 5: 2*\n        This means Player 1 is getting:\n        *Item 1: 3, Item 2: 2, Item 3: 3, Item 4: 3, Item 5: 2*\n\n        A more balanced offer would be closer to half of each item to player 1:\n        *Item 1: 2, Item 2: 1, Item 3: 1, Item 4: 2, Item 5: 2*\n        This gives me:\n        *Item 1: 2, Item 2: 1, Item 3: 2, Item 4: 3, Item 5: 2*\n        My value is then:\n        2 * 76 + 1 * 67 + 2 * 18 + 3 * 27 + 2 * 71 = 152 + 67 + 36 + 81 + 142 = 478\n\n3.  **Make a decision:**\n\n    *   The current offer (272) is better than my outside offer (192), so walking away would be a mistake.\n    *   The current offer is better than my outside offer, so accepting it would be rational.\n    *   I can also consider making a counteroffer that is more beneficial to me than 272.\n\nConsidering these calculations, while the current offer is better than my outside offer, a counteroffer could potentially yield a higher value. Let's propose a counteroffer that gives a slightly larger share of the items to myself while still leaving the other player with a reasonable amount.\nI will propose giving Player 1:\n*Item 1: 1, Item 2: 1, Item 3: 1, Item 4: 2, Item 5: 1*\nThis gives me:\n*Item 1: 3, Item 2: 1, Item 3: 2, Item 4: 3, Item 5: 3*\nMy value then is:\n3 * 76 + 1 * 67 + 2 * 18 + 3 * 27 + 3 * 71 = 228 + 67 + 36 + 81 + 213 = 625\n\nThis is significantly better than 272, so I will propose the counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 2, 1]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

                    "response": "To determine the appropriate action, let's analyze the situation carefully:\n\n1) **Current Situation Analysis:**\n   - My outside offer value is 953.\n   - My values per unit for each item type are:\n     - Item 1: 59\n     - Item 2: 59\n     - Item 3: 50\n     - Item 4: 80\n     - Item 5: 49\n   - The total pool of items is:\n     - 4 units of Item 1\n     - 5 units of Item 2\n     - 6 units of Item 3\n     - 3 units of Item 4\n     - 5 units of Item 5\n   - The discount factor decreases the value of future offers if negotiation continues beyond this round.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n   - There is currently no offer from Player 2.\n   - A valid counteroffer should ensure my total value is greater than 953 (my outside offer).\n\n3) **Decision Making:**\n   - To make an initial offer, I should ensure that I keep items such that their total value to me exceeds 953.\n   - Let's propose a counteroffer where I keep the majority of high-value items.\n\n**Calculating a Counteroffer:**\nTo maximize my value, I want to ensure my retained items at least meet my outside offer value. Let's use a proposed division that helps achieve this:\n\n- Let's propose giving Player 2: \n  - 2 units of Item 1\n  - 2 units of Item 2\n  - 3 units of Item 3\n  - 1 unit of Item 4\n  - 2 units of Item 5\n\n**Check:**\n- My units retained: \n  - Items retained: `[2, 3, 3, 2, 3]`\n  - Value calculation:\n    - Item 1: 2 \u00d7 59 = 118\n    - Item 2: 3 \u00d7 59 = 177\n    - Item 3: 3 \u00d7 50 = 150\n    - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 80 = 160\n    - Item 5: 3 \u00d7 49 = 147\n- Total value: 118 + 177 + 150 + 160 + 147 = 752\n\nThis offer does not exceed my outside offer value. I'll adjust the proposal.\n\n**Revised Counteroffer Calculation:**\n\n- Let's propose giving Player 2: \n  - 1 unit of Item 1\n  - 1 unit of Item 2\n  - 2 units of Item 3\n  - 1 unit of Item 4\n  - 2 units of Item 5\n\n- My units retained:\n  - Items retained: `[3, 4, 4, 2, 3]`\n  - Value calculation:\n    - Item 1: 3 \u00d7 59 = 177\n    - Item 2: 4 \u00d7 59 = 236\n    - Item 3: 4 \u00d7 50 = 200\n    - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 80 = 160\n    - Item 5: 3 \u00d7 49 = 147\n- Total value: 177 + 236 + 200 + 160 + 147 = 920\n\nGiven this total value (920), which is less than my outside offer, I'll further adjust to better balance retention value.\n\n**New Counteroffer Calculation:**\n\n- Let's propose giving Player 2: \n  - 1 unit of Item 1\n  - 1 unit of Item 2\n  - 2 units of Item 3\n  - 1 unit of Item 4\n  - 1 unit of Item 5\n\n- My units retained: \n  - Items retained: `[3, 4, 4, 2, 4]`\n  - Value calculation:\n    - Item 1: 3 \u00d7 59 = 177\n    - Item 2: 4 \u00d7 59 = 236\n    - Item 3: 4 \u00d7 50 = 200\n    - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 80 = 160\n    - Item 5: 4 \u00d7 49 = 196\n- Total value: 177 + 236 + 200 + 160 + 196 = 969\n\nThis offer ensures my value exceeds the outside offer (953) and retains a strong position. \n\nThus, my action is to propose the following counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 2, 1, 1]}\n```",

This means accepting an offer in a later round is worth less than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   Current offer: Player 1 offers me [1, 1, 2, 1, 1]. This means I get:\n    *   1 unit of item 1\n    *   1 unit of item 2\n    *   2 units of item 3\n    *   1 unit of item 4\n    *   1 unit of item 5\n    My value for this offer is: (1 * 13) + (1 * 44) + (2 * 69) + (1 * 61) + (1 * 54) = 13 + 44 + 138 + 61 + 54 = 310\n\n    This value (310) is less than my outside offer (603).\n\n*   Potential counteroffers: I need to find a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than my outside offer. This means I keep more valuable items for myself.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince the current offer (310) is less than my outside offer (603), I should not accept it (Mistake 4). I also don't want to walk away now if I can get a better deal by making a counteroffer that gives me a higher value.\n\nLet's try to create a counteroffer. A good starting point is to offer Player 1 the minimum amount of items. I have:\n*   4 units of item 1\n*   5 units of item 2\n*   6 units of item 3\n*   3 units of item 4\n*   5 units of item 5\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I keep all items:\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0] offered to Player 1.\n\nThat means I have:\n*   4 units of item 1 = 4 * 13 = 52\n*   5 units of item 2 = 5 * 44 = 220\n*   6 units of item 3 = 6 * 69 = 414\n*   3 units of item 4 = 3 * 61 = 183\n*   5 units of item 5 = 5 * 54 = 270\nTotal value = 52 + 220 + 414 + 183 + 270 = 1139\n\nSince 1139 is significantly higher than my outside offer of 603, I can afford to give away some items. Let's aim for a split that's closer to my outside offer value, while still being higher. I'll try a more balanced offer.\n\nLet's try offering Player 1 [1, 2, 3, 1, 2]. This means I keep:\n*   3 units of item 1 = 3 * 13 = 39\n*   3 units of item 2 = 3 * 44 = 132\n*   3 units of item 3 = 3 * 69 = 207\n*   2 units of item 4 = 2 * 61 = 122\n*   3 units of item 5 = 3 * 54 = 162\nTotal value = 39 + 132 + 207 + 122 + 162 = 662\n\nThis is greater than my outside offer of 603. Therefore, I will make a counteroffer of [1, 2, 3, 1, 2].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 3, 1, 2]}\n```",

                    "response": "Let's analyze the current situation and determine the best course of action:\n\n1) **Analyze the Current Situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 953.\n   - My values for each item are:\n     - Item 1: 59\n     - Item 2: 59\n     - Item 3: 50\n     - Item 4: 80\n     - Item 5: 49 \n   - The total pool of items:\n     - 4 units of item 1\n     - 5 units of item 2\n     - 6 units of item 3\n     - 3 units of item 4\n     - 5 units of item 5\n   - The current offer gives me [1, 2, 3, 1, 2] units. My value for this offer is calculated as follows:\n     - 1 unit of item 1: 1 \u00d7 59 = 59\n     - 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 59 = 118\n     - 3 units of item 3: 3 \u00d7 50 = 150\n     - 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 80 = 80\n     - 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 49 = 98\n     - Total value = 505\n\n2) **Effect of Discount Factor:**\n   - In round 2, the discount factor (\u03b3) is 0.9, so the effective value of accepting an offer now would be multiplied by 0.9. Therefore, the effective value of the current offer is 505 \u00d7 0.9 = 454.5.\n\n3) **Compare Values and Make a Decision:**\n   - The effective value of accepting the current offer (454.5) is much less than my outside offer (953).\n   - Given that the current offer is not more valuable than my outside offer, accepting it would violate item 4 in the potential mistake list.\n\n4) **Make a Decision on Next Steps:**\n   - I need to propose a counteroffer that gives me a value higher than my outside offer of 953.\n   - Calculating potential counteroffers: If I consider keeping 3 units of item 1, 3 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 2 of item 4, and 3 of item 5 for myself and offering the rest to Player 2, my value would be:\n     - 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 59 = 177\n     - 3 units of item 2: 3 \u00d7 59 = 177\n     - 4 units of item 3: 4 \u00d7 50 = 200\n     - 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 80 = 160\n     - 3 units of item 5: 3 \u00d7 49 = 147\n     - Total value = 861\n   - Discounted by the factor for 2nd round: 861 \u00d7 0.9 = 774.9, which is still lower than 953.\n   - Let's adjust to keep 4 units of item 1, 4 of item 2, 5 of item 3, 2 of item 4, and 3 of item 5 for myself:\n     - 4 units of item 1: 4 \u00d7 59 = 236\n     - 4 units of item 2: 4 \u00d7 59 = 236\n     - 5 units of item 3: 5 \u00d7 50 = 250\n     - 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 80 = 160\n     - 3 units of item 5: 3 \u00d7 49 = 147\n     - Total value = 1029\n   - Discounted by the factor for 2nd round: 1029 \u00d7 0.9 = 926.1, which is closer to 953.\n\nTherefore, I will make a counteroffer: Offer [0, 1, 1, 1, 2] to Player 2.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 1, 1, 2]}",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 603. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 603. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 723 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 5, 1, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    13 x 0 + 44 x 2 + 69 x 5 + 61 x 1 + 54 x 2\n    which is 602 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 603. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 2, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 2, 3, 1, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 1, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 1, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 603\n*   My item values: item 1 = 13, item 2 = 44, item 3 = 69, item 4 = 61, item 5 = 54\n*   Total items: item 1 = 4, item 2 = 5, item 3 = 6, item 4 = 3, item 5 = 5\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 90% of its value in round 2, and an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 90% of its value in round 1.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [0, 1, 1, 1, 2]. This means I would receive 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n    *   Value of current offer: (0 * 13) + (1 * 44) + (1 * 69) + (1 * 61) + (2 * 54) = 0 + 44 + 69 + 61 + 108 = 282\n*   Since this is round 2, accepting now would yield a value of 282 * (0.9^(2-1)) = 282 * 0.9 = 253.8\n*   This is significantly less than my outside offer of 603. So, accepting is not a good idea.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:**\n    Let's consider a few counteroffers to see if we can find a better deal than walking away. I need to keep enough items so that my total value exceeds my outside offer of 603.\n    Since there are 4 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 5 units of item 5 in total, if I counteroffer [n1, n2, n3, n4, n5], then my kept items are [4-n1, 5-n2, 6-n3, 3-n4, 5-n5].\n    *   **Counteroffer 1: Give Player 1 nothing [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]:** I keep all items: [4, 5, 6, 3, 5]. Value: (4 * 13) + (5 * 44) + (6 * 69) + (3 * 61) + (5 * 54) = 52 + 220 + 414 + 183 + 270 = 1139. This is the best possible outcome, but unlikely to be accepted.\n    *   **Counteroffer 2: Try to get as much as possible without being greedy.**\n    If I offer [1, 2, 3, 1, 2] again, then I keep [3, 3, 3, 2, 3]. Value: (3 * 13) + (3 * 44) + (3 * 69) + (2 * 61) + (3 * 54) = 39 + 132 + 207 + 122 + 162 = 662. This is better than the outside offer.\n    *   **Counteroffer 3: Try to offer something slightly better than their offer to me and keep my value high.**\n    If I offer [1, 2, 2, 1, 1], then I keep [3, 3, 4, 2, 4]. Value: (3 * 13) + (3 * 44) + (4 * 69) + (2 * 61) + (4 * 54) = 39 + 132 + 276 + 122 + 216 = 785. This is better than the outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\nSince the current offer is worth less than my outside offer (even with the discount factor), I should not accept. I have two options: WALK or COUNTEROFFER. Since there's one round remaining, if I counteroffer, it will automatically result in a walk in the case that Player 1 rejects.\nI should offer something more reasonable than offering nothing. Counteroffer 2 is better than Counteroffer 3 to Player 1, so let me try Counteroffer 2 with value 662 > 603.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 3, 1, 2]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 636. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 576 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the situation step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer is 636.\n- **Values of the Items**:\n  - Item 1: 8\n  - Item 2: 17\n  - Item 3: 69\n  - Item 4: 17\n  - Item 5: 81\n\n- **Total Pool of Items**:\n  - 4 units of item 1\n  - 3 units of item 2\n  - 6 units of item 3\n  - 4 units of item 4\n  - 4 units of item 5\n\n- **Discount Factor**: The discount factor is 0.9, meaning any offer in later rounds will have less value due to the discounting effect.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\nNo current offer exists, as I'm starting the negotiations.\n\n#### Values:\n- **Total value of all items for me**: \n  - \\(4 \\times 8 + 3 \\times 17 + 6 \\times 69 + 4 \\times 17 + 4 \\times 81 = 32 + 51 + 414 + 68 + 324 = 889\\)\n\n#### Propose an Initial Counteroffer\n\nTo make a strategic counteroffer, let's aim to keep the total value above my outside offer and consider the maximum value I can get early on:\n\n- **Initial counteroffer with keeping higher-value items**:\n\n  1. Keep most of item 3 and item 5, as they are highest in value.\n  2. Offer a division that keeps my total above the outside offer:\n  \n   Suppose I offer Player 2:\n   - 0 units of item 1\n   - 1 unit of item 2 (low value for me)\n   - 3 units of item 3\n   - 0 units of item 4\n   - 2 units of item 5\n\n- **Calculate total value for keeping:**\n  - Remaining for myself: \\(4 \\times 8 + 2 \\times 17 + 3 \\times 69 + 4 \\times 17 + 2 \\times 81\\)\n  - \\(= 32 + 34 + 207 + 68 + 162 = 503\\)\n\nThis value, 503, is under my outside offer of 636. Let's try reducing what I give:\n\nReevaluate the division for a higher personal value:\n\n- Offer Player 2:\n  - 0 units of item 1\n  - 2 units of item 2\n  - 1 unit of item 3\n  - 2 units of item 4\n  - 2 units of item 5\n\n- **Calculate the new value:**\n  - Remaining for myself: \\(4 \\times 8 + 1 \\times 17 + 5 \\times 69 + 2 \\times 17 + 2 \\times 81\\)\n  - \\(= 32 + 17 + 345 + 34 + 162 = 590\\)\n\nThis is still under my outside offer. Thus, offer an even more advantageous situation with less sharing.\n\n- Offer Player 2:\n  - 0 units of item 1\n  - 1 unit of item 2\n  - 2 units of item 3\n  - 1 unit of item 4\n  - 2 units of item 5\n\n- **Calculate yet refined value for me:**\n  - Remaining: \\(4 \\times 8 + 2 \\times 17 + 4 \\times 69 + 3 \\times 17 + 2 \\times 81 = 32 + 34 + 276 + 51 + 162 = 555\\)\n\nAgain, keep most value:\n- Offer Player 2:\n  - 0 units of item 1\n  - 1 unit of item 2\n  - 2 units of item 3\n  - 0 units of item 4\n  - 1 unit of item 5\n\n- **New Value Check**: \n  - Keeping: \\(4 \\times 8 + 2 \\times 17 + 4 \\times 69 + 4 \\times 17 + 3 \\times 81 = 32 + 34 + 276 + 68 + 243 = 653\\)\n\nThis is above 636.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nBased on this analysis, the strategic action with respect to maximizing our value is to propose a counteroffer that keeps more valuable items, thereby keeping our outcomes favorable compared to the outside offer.\n\n- **COUNTEROFFER**:\n  - Offer Player 2: \n  - [0, 1, 2, 0, 1] (giving them: 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5)\n\nThis yields me a balance of maximizing within a certain threshold, avoiding mistake 2, and leads to a value of 653.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 2, 0, 1]}\n```",

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value is 372.\n*   My item values are: item 1 = 30, item 2 = 46, item 3 = 44, item 4 = 90, item 5 = 3.\n*   The total pool of items is: 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5.\n*   The discount factor is 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 90% of its face value, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 81% of its face value. Delaying agreement reduces the overall payoff.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** Player 1 offers me [0, 1, 2, 0, 1]. This means I receive:\n    *   0 units of item 1\n    *   1 unit of item 2\n    *   2 units of item 3\n    *   0 units of item 4\n    *   1 unit of item 5\n    The value of this offer to me is (0 * 30) + (1 * 46) + (2 * 44) + (0 * 90) + (1 * 3) = 0 + 46 + 88 + 0 + 3 = 137.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (137) is less than my outside offer (372). Therefore, accepting the current offer would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to determine a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer. To do this, I should keep the items I value most highly, which are item 4 and item 2. My total items are [4, 3, 6, 4, 4]. Let's consider an offer where I keep all of item 4 (4 units) and all of item 2 (3 units). I would then keep 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 3 and 3 unit of item 5 to get a total above 372\n    *   Keep: 3 item 1, 3 item 2, 4 item 3, 4 item 4, 3 item 5.\n    *   Offer: 1 item 1, 0 item 2, 2 item 3, 0 item 4, 1 item 5.\n    Value of my keep: (3 * 30) + (3 * 46) + (4 * 44) + (4 * 90) + (3 * 3) = 90 + 138 + 176 + 360 + 9 = 773. This is greater than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince the current offer is significantly worse than my outside offer, I should not accept.\nI should make a counteroffer.\nMy counteroffer would be [1, 0, 2, 0, 1] (giving these amounts to Player 1).\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 2, 0, 1]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 271. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 600 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

However, subsequent rounds will discount the value by a factor of 0.9 per round after round 2. Thus, securing a good deal earlier is preferable to avoid loss in value due to the discount.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n- **Current offer**: None on the table yet.\n- **Potential counteroffers**: I need to assess potential offers where my retained value is above 271 to ensure it's better than my outside offer.\n\nLet's consider potential offers:\n- A counteroffer that ensures my retained value is greater than 271.\n\nAssuming I attempt to maximize my high-value items like items 1 and 2:\n\n1. **Offer 1**: Keep 1 unit of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5.\n   - My Value:\n     - Item 1: 1 \u00d7 80 = 80\n     - Item 2: 3 \u00d7 79 = 237\n     - Item 3: 3 \u00d7 3 = 9\n     - Item 4: 3 \u00d7 23 = 69\n     - Item 5: 3 \u00d7 15 = 45\n     - Total Value = 80 + 237 + 9 + 69 + 45 = 440\n\nThis offer provides a value of 440, well above 271, which is much better than my outside offer.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n- **Accept the current offer**: Not applicable since there's no current offer.\n- **Walk away**: Only if I can't propose an offer above 271.\n- **Propose a counteroffer**: Given my calculation, Offer 1 gives a substantial value above my outside offer.\n\nTherefore, I will propose Offer 1, as it maximizes my value and is superior to my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```",

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This means that if I delay reaching an agreement, the value of any deal will be multiplied by 0.9 in the next round, and 0.9^2 in the round after that.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - The current offer is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], which means Player 1 is offering me 1 unit of each item. This implies I would keep:\n        - 1 unit of item 1 (2 total - 1 offered to me = 1 kept)\n        - 3 units of item 2 (4 total - 1 offered to me = 3 kept)\n        - 3 units of item 3 (4 total - 1 offered to me = 3 kept)\n        - 3 units of item 4 (4 total - 1 offered to me = 3 kept)\n        - 3 units of item 5 (4 total - 1 offered to me = 3 kept)\n\n    -  The value of accepting this offer would be:\n        - 1 * 70 + 3 * 96 + 3 * 100 + 3 * 98 + 3 * 27 = 70 + 288 + 300 + 294 + 81 = 1033\n\n    -  1033 < 1314 (my outside offer). Therefore, accepting the current offer would be worse than walking away.\n\n    -  Let's consider a possible counteroffer.

This means that accepting an offer in a later round is worth less than accepting the same offer in an earlier round.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer: [0, 0, 4, 4, 3]. This means I receive 0 of Item 1, 0 of Item 2, 4 of Item 3, 4 of Item 4, and 3 of Item 5.\n      My value for current offer: (0 * 70) + (0 * 96) + (4 * 100) + (4 * 98) + (3 * 27) = 0 + 0 + 400 + 392 + 81 = 873\n      Discounted value (round 2): 873 * 0.9^(2-1) = 873 * 0.9 = 785.7\n\n      Since 785.7 < 1314 (my outside offer), accepting the current offer is not a good idea.\n\n3) Consider a counteroffer: I need to keep enough items so that my total value exceeds my outside offer of 1314, after discounting for round 2. This means my undiscounted value must exceed 1314/0.9 = 1460.\n\nLet's explore some potential counteroffers. I will be offering items to Player 1. My goal is to find an offer where what I keep has a value > 1460.\n\nFirst, I should consider the items that give the most value to me.\n- Item 3 is 100\n- Item 4 is 98\n- Item 2 is 96\n- Item 1 is 70\n- Item 5 is 27\n\nLet's see what happens if I only give Player 1 the items with lowest values.\nIf I offer [2, 4, 0, 0, 4], I keep [0, 0, 4, 4, 0]. That has a value of 400+392 = 792.\nIf I offer [0, 4, 0, 0, 4], I keep [2, 0, 4, 4, 0]. That has a value of 140+400+392 = 932.\nThose are both pretty bad.\n\nLet's try keeping all of the items that give me high value and giving away more of the low-value items.\nIf I offer [0, 0, 4, 4, 0], I keep [2, 4, 0, 0, 4]. That has a value of 140+384+108 = 632.\n\nIf I want to keep more valuable items, I could consider offering the player the following offer:\n[2, 4, 0, 0, 0]\nThis means I keep [0, 0, 4, 4, 4]. My value is 400+392+108=900\n\nLet's try keeping one of each item.\n\nIf I keep 1 of each item, and the leftovers are offered to Player 1:\nI keep [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] for a value of 70+96+100+98+27 = 391. Then the discount factor gives me 391 * 0.9 = 351.9. So I need to increase this.\nSo I offer [1, 3, 3, 3, 3]. That means I keep [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. Value = 391.\n\nTo be above 1460 I need to keep enough items.\nWhat if I offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]? Then I keep [2, 4, 4, 4, 4] = 140+384+400+392+108=1424, which * 0.9 is 1281.6\nSo if I offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], it's slightly less than my walk away value.\n\nSo what if I keep 1 of item 3 and give away the rest?\nI offer [2, 4, 3, 4, 4]\nI keep [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\nMy value is 100 * 0.9 = 90.\nIf I keep 1 of item 2 and give away the rest?\nI offer [2, 3, 4, 4, 4]\nI keep [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\nMy value is 96 * 0.9 = 86.4\nIf I keep 1 of item 4 and give away the rest?\nI offer [2, 4, 4, 3, 4]\nI keep [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\nMy value is 98 * 0.9 = 88.2\n\nOkay, so it seems like I need to give almost nothing away to get a value > 1460\n\nHow about I offer 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 0 of item 4, and 4 of item 5.\nI keep [2, 4, 4, 4, 0]\nMy value is 140 + 384 + 400 + 392 = 1316, times discount 0.9 = 1184.4\n\nI will try offering [0, 0, 3, 3, 0].\n\nI keep [2, 4, 1, 1, 4]. The value is 140 + 384 + 100 + 98 + 108 = 830.\n\nBased on this, it appears that I'm better off walking away, or offering near to nothing and hoping they accept.\n\nIt is better to walk away since the discount rate of 0.9 makes it difficult to get close to 1314 in round 2.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

This is the fallback I have if the negotiation doesn't yield a better outcome.\n   - **Values of the items involved**:\n     - Item 1: 49 per unit\n     - Item 2: 68 per unit\n     - Item 3: 58 per unit\n     - Item 4: 83 per unit\n     - Item 5: 1 per unit\n   - **Total pool of items**:\n     - 7 units of item 1\n     - 5 units of item 2\n     - 6 units of item 3\n     - 5 units of item 4\n     - 5 units of item 5\n   - **Discount factor (gamma)**: 0.9, influencing the value of accepting an offer in later rounds.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - **Value assessment of potential counteroffers**:\n     - I need to consider dividing items such that my total value exceeds 1350.\n     - Calculate the value of items if I keep different amounts, ensuring the sum is at least 1350.\n   \n3) Basing the initial counteroffer on the value calculation:\n   - To maximize my value and ensure the offer is better than my outside offer, I need to focus on keeping high-value items like item 2 and item 4 as much as possible.\n\nLet's propose a counteroffer:\n   - Assume I keep 6 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n   \n   - My offer to Player 2 would hence be:\n     - 1 unit of item 1\n     - 1 unit of item 2\n     - 1 unit of item 3\n     - 2 units of item 4\n     - 4 units of item 5\n\n   - Calculating my total value for the above kept items:\n     - 6 units of item 1 = 6 \u00d7 49 = 294\n     - 4 units of item 2 = 4 \u00d7 68 = 272\n     - 5 units of item 3 = 5 \u00d7 58 = 290\n     - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 83 = 249\n     - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 1 = 1\n\n   - Total value = 294 + 272 + 290 + 249 + 1 = 1106\n\nThis gives me a total value of 1106, which is unfortunately less than my outside offer of 1350. To exceed my outside offer, I need to adjust my offer to increase the retention of higher value items.\n\n   - Updating my offer for enhanced retention value:\n     - 5 units of item 1 (retained) = 5 \u00d7 49 = 245\n     - 3 units of item 2 (retained) = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204\n     - 4 units of item 3 (retained) = 4 \u00d7 58 = 232\n     - 5 units of item 4 (retained) = 5 \u00d7 83 = 415\n     - 2 units of item 5 (retained) = 2 \u00d7 1 = 2\n\n   - Total value = 245 + 204 + 232 + 415 + 2 = 1098 (which needs further improvement).\n\nFinally, after evaluating possibilities, we set a feasible counteroffer that ensures value maximization:\n\n- Propose a counteroffer ensuring it leverages item 4's high value more effectively:\n  - Offer Player 2 items: \n    - [0, 2, 2, 0, 5] (means Player 2 gets minor items)\n\nHere is my action in the required format:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 2, 0, 5]}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 2, 4, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    31 x 0 + 53 x 2 + 31 x 2 + 35 x 4 + 85 x 3\n    which is 563 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 564. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 2, 0, 5]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 2, 0, 5]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 2, 1, 2, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    1 x 1 + 33 x 2 + 57 x 1 + 43 x 2 + 99 x 0\n    which is 210 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 211. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 3, 0, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 3, 0, 3]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",

However, it is still early in the negotiation (round 1). I will try to get an even better deal. I'll construct a counteroffer that gives more to Player 1 for items I value less and keeps more for items I value highly, particularly item 5.\n\nLet's start by calculating my current potential value by keeping all the items: (3 * 1) + (5 * 33) + (3 * 57) + (4 * 43) + (8 * 99) = 3 + 165 + 171 + 172 + 792 = 1303\nNow let me propose a counteroffer.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 187. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 798 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

It means accepting an offer later will yield slightly less value due to the present value being lessened by the discount rate.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\nThere is no current offer as this is the first move.\n\nI'll calculate potential values based on different divisions:\n\nI should propose a counteroffer where my total value is higher than my outside offer.\n\n#### Potential Counteroffer Calculation:\n\nTo ensure a value higher than 518, I'll attempt a favorable split:\n- Keep most units of the highest value items to increase my total value.\n\nLet's propose:\n- Offer Player 2: [2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5]\n- Keep for myself: [5 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5]\n\n**Value to Me**:\n- 5 units of item 1 = 5 \u00d7 47 = 235\n- 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 40 = 80\n- 4 units of item 3 = 4 \u00d7 31 = 124\n- 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 18 = 36\n- 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 10 = 0\n- Total Value = 475\n\nThis value (475) is actually less than my outside offer (518). So, I'd need to adjust the offer more in my favor to increase the value I am holding.\n\nLet's try another allocation:\n\n- Offer Player 2: [1 unit of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5]\n- Keep for myself: [6 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5]\n\n**Value to Me**:\n- 6 units of item 1 = 6 \u00d7 47 = 282\n- 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 40 = 120\n- 4 units of item 3 = 4 \u00d7 31 = 124\n- 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 18 = 0\n- 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 10 = 10\n- Total Value = 536\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nGiven that the revised counteroffer yields me 536, which is better than my outside offer of 518, this counteroffer is a viable action.\n\nTherefore, the action I will take is to propose this counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 5, 2]}\n```",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 1075. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1075. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 879 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [7, 2, 4, 4, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    62 x 7 + 76 x 2 + 72 x 4 + 16 x 4 + 67 x 2\n    which is 1072 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1075. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 5, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 0, 5, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Current Situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 1075.\n   - My values for the items are: item 1 = 62, item 2 = 76, item 3 = 72, item 4 = 16, item 5 = 67.\n   - Total items: 7 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5.\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means offers in later rounds are worth less.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n   - **Current Offer:** I am being offered [1, 0, 0, 5, 2]. This means I keep:\n     - Item 1: 7 - 1 = 6 units\n     - Item 2: 3 - 0 = 3 units\n     - Item 3: 4 - 0 = 4 units\n     - Item 4: 5 - 5 = 0 units\n     - Item 5: 3 - 2 = 1 unit\n     My total value if I accept this offer is:\n     (6 * 62) + (3 * 76) + (4 * 72) + (0 * 16) + (1 * 67) = 372 + 228 + 288 + 0 + 67 = 955\n\n   - **Comparison to Outside Offer:** The current offer (955) is less than my outside offer (1075). Therefore, accepting this offer would be a mistake.\n\n   - **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 1075. I should start by keeping more of the high-value items (1, 2, and 3).\n\n3) **Making a Decision:**\nSince the current offer is worse than my outside offer, I should either WALK or make a COUNTEROFFER. Since it is only round 1, I'll try making a counteroffer. I need to give Player 1 an offer that is attractive enough for them to accept, while ensuring that I get a value greater than my outside offer. I will start by making an offer that gives me the best possible outcome and iterate from there.\n\nLet's try offering [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] to Player 1.  This means I keep everything.  My value would be:\n7 * 62 + 3 * 76 + 4 * 72 + 5 * 16 + 3 * 67 = 434 + 228 + 288 + 80 + 201 = 1231.  This is greater than 1075. So, I can start from here and offer small quantities of the items to Player 1.\n\nI will now offer [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] to Player 1, which seems reasonable. My value would be:\n(7-1) * 62 + (3-1) * 76 + (4-1) * 72 + (5-1) * 16 + (3-1) * 67 = 6*62 + 2*76 + 3*72 + 4*16 + 2*67 = 372 + 152 + 216 + 64 + 134 = 938.  This is less than my outside offer.\n\nLet's try another counteroffer that provides a value greater than 1075. To do that, I must keep more items and only give away items of lesser value. I want to keep all of item 1, item 2, and item 3, and reduce the amount of items 4 and 5 that I keep. Therefore I will make an offer of [0, 0, 0, 3, 2].\nMy value would be:\n7 * 62 + 3 * 76 + 4 * 72 + (5-3) * 16 + (3-2) * 67 = 434 + 228 + 288 + 2*16 + 1*67 = 434 + 228 + 288 + 32 + 67 = 1049\nThis is less than my outside offer, so this is not a good offer.\n\nTo increase the value to myself I should keep the higher value items. What about keeping all of items 1, 2, 3, and giving away item 4 and item 5. My counteroffer will be [0, 0, 0, 5, 3].\nMy value would be:\n7 * 62 + 3 * 76 + 4 * 72 + (5-5) * 16 + (3-3) * 67 = 434 + 228 + 288 + 0 + 0 = 950\nThis is not a good offer since it is less than my outside offer.\n\nI need an offer with at least 1075 in value. So, let me offer [1, 0, 0, 4, 3]. My value would be:\n(7-1)*62 + (3-0)*76 + (4-0)*72 + (5-4)*16 + (3-3)*67 = 6*62 + 3*76 + 4*72 + 1*16 + 0*67 = 372 + 228 + 288 + 16 + 0 = 904.\nThis is less than 1075. I will try another offer.\n\nMy counteroffer will be [1, 0, 0, 5, 1].\nMy value would be:\n(7-1)*62 + (3-0)*76 + (4-0)*72 + (5-5)*16 + (3-1)*67 = 6*62 + 3*76 + 4*72 + 0 + 2*67 = 372 + 228 + 288 + 0 + 134 = 1022.\nThis is less than 1075.\n\nMy counteroffer will be [1, 0, 0, 4, 2].\nMy value would be:\n(7-1)*62 + (3-0)*76 + (4-0)*72 + (5-4)*16 + (3-2)*67 = 6*62 + 3*76 + 4*72 + 16 + 67 = 372 + 228 + 288 + 16 + 67 = 971.\nThis is less than 1075.\n\nMy counteroffer will be [0, 0, 0, 5, 0].\nMy value would be:\n7*62 + 3*76 + 4*72 + 0 + 3*67 = 434 + 228 + 288 + 0 + 201 = 1151.\nThis is better than my outside offer. I will propose this offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 5, 0]}\n```",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 1075. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1075. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 879 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [7, 2, 4, 4, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    62 x 7 + 76 x 2 + 72 x 4 + 16 x 4 + 67 x 2\n    which is 1072 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1075. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 5, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 5, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 5, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 0, 5, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 1075\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 62, Item 2: 76, Item 3: 72, Item 4: 16, Item 5: 67\n*   **Total items:** Item 1: 7, Item 2: 3, Item 3: 4, Item 4: 5, Item 5: 3\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that accepting an offer in round 2 gives me 0.9 times its actual value, and in round 3, it's 0.9^2 = 0.81 times its value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am offered [1, 0, 0, 5, 2]. This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 1\n    *   Item 2: 0\n    *   Item 3: 0\n    *   Item 4: 5\n    *   Item 5: 2\n    I keep 7-1=6 of Item 1, 3-0=3 of Item 2, 4-0=4 of Item 3, 5-5=0 of Item 4 and 3-2=1 of Item 5.\n    *   Value of keeping these items is 6 * 62 + 3 * 76 + 4 * 72 + 0 * 16 + 1 * 67 = 372 + 228 + 288 + 0 + 67 = 955. This is my total value for accepting the current offer.\n    *   Since it's round 2, the discounted value is 955 * 0.9 = 859.5\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:**\n    *   Accepting the current offer gives me a discounted value of 859.5, which is less than my outside offer of 1075.\n\n*   **Consider possible counteroffers:** I need to find an offer that is worth more than 1075/0.9 = 1194.44 to me to be better than walking away.\n    My current offer in round 1 was [0, 0, 0, 5, 0] to Player 1. This means I kept all items except for 5 units of item 4. My value in round 1 was (7 * 62) + (3 * 76) + (4 * 72) + (0 * 16) + (3 * 67) = 434 + 228 + 288 + 0 + 201 = 1151.\n    My discounted value in round 1 was 1151 * 0.9 = 1035.9, so it was not better than my outside offer in the previous round.\n    Player 1's initial offer was [1, 0, 0, 5, 2]. This means Player 1 values these items more than I do, as they have been stubborn about receiving them. I value Items 1 and 5 more than Item 4.\n    Let's see if I can construct an offer that is better for me than walking away.\n    Suppose I offer Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. My value would be (7*62) + (3*76) + (4*72) + (5*16) + (3*67) = 434 + 228 + 288 + 80 + 201 = 1231. The discounted value is 1231 * 0.9 = 1107.9. This is larger than 1075.\n    Now suppose I offer Player 1 [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. Then I keep 6, 2, 3, 4, 2, which results in 6*62 + 2*76 + 3*72 + 4*16 + 2*67 = 372 + 152 + 216 + 64 + 134 = 938. The discounted value is 938 * 0.9 = 844.2 which is not good.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\nSince the current offer is worse than my outside offer, I should either walk away or make a counteroffer. If I offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], then the discounted value is 1107.9, which is greater than my outside offer.\nTherefore, I will make a counteroffer of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

The full value of items is considered.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n- **Current Offer:** There is no current offer from Player 2.\n- **Potential Counteroffers:**\n  - To decide on a counteroffer, I need to ensure that the division yields more value than my outside offer (678) and does not give away too much value.\n  - Let's consider an offer where I propose the following division, maximizing my value:\n    - Let's assume I keep 5 units of item 3, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 5, and we split items 1 and 4 evenly:\n      - My share in this scenario:\n        - Item 1: 3 units \u00d7 6 = 18\n        - Item 2: 3 units \u00d7 68 = 204\n        - Item 3: 5 units \u00d7 98 = 490\n        - Item 4: 1 unit \u00d7 16 = 16\n        - Item 5: 4 units \u00d7 64 = 256\n      - Total value = 18 + 204 + 490 + 16 + 256 = 984\n\n### 3) Make a Decision:\nMy calculated offer has a total value of 984, which is greater than my outside offer (678).

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 2, 5, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    79 x 1 + 41 x 2 + 21 x 5 + 97 x 2 + 55 x 2\n    which is 570 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 571. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 0, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 2, 0, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 571\n*   My values per item: item 1: 79, item 2: 41, item 3: 21, item 4: 97, item 5: 55\n*   Total items: 5 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means that accepting an offer in later rounds is worth less due to the discount.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am offered [2, 2, 0, 1, 2]. This means I would receive:\n    *   2 units of item 1: 2 * 79 = 158\n    *   2 units of item 2: 2 * 41 = 82\n    *   0 units of item 3: 0 * 21 = 0\n    *   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 97 = 97\n    *   2 units of item 5: 2 * 55 = 110\n    *   Total value of current offer: 158 + 82 + 0 + 97 + 110 = 447\n\n    447 < 571, so accepting the current offer is worse than my outside offer.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that is better than 571. Let's start by considering what happens if I try to take everything and offer Player 1 nothing. This is [5,5,5,2,6]. This would be a mistake!\nMy current allocation is:\nItem 1 = 5 - 2 = 3\nItem 2 = 5 - 2 = 3\nItem 3 = 5 - 0 = 5\nItem 4 = 2 - 1 = 1\nItem 5 = 6 - 2 = 4\n\nValue = 3*79 + 3*41 + 5*21 + 1*97 + 4*55\nValue = 237 + 123 + 105 + 97 + 220 = 782\nSince 782 is greater than my outside offer, it is okay to make this offer or a version that does not give as much to the other player. I need to find a balance.\n\nI can propose an offer giving the player 1 units of each item such that I still get a value greater than 571.\n\nLet's consider the items where I have the lowest value - this is item 3. Suppose I give them 4 items. Then I get one unit of item 3 with value 21.\nSuppose I give them 1 unit of item 4. Then I get one unit of item 4 with value 97.\nLet's construct an offer for the other player: [2, 2, 2, 1, 2]. This will make the other player happy.\n\nIf I give them [2, 2, 2, 1, 2], then I keep [3, 3, 3, 1, 4].\nMy new value = 3*79 + 3*41 + 3*21 + 1*97 + 4*55 = 237 + 123 + 63 + 97 + 220 = 740.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is worse than my outside offer. Offering [5,5,5,2,6] will be considered rude by the other player and I should offer something.\nI will make a counteroffer that gives Player 1: [2, 2, 2, 1, 2]\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 2, 1, 2]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 2, 5, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    79 x 1 + 41 x 2 + 21 x 5 + 97 x 2 + 55 x 2\n    which is 570 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 571. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 0, 1, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 2, 2, 1, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 0, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 2, 0, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the optimal action for Player 2 in Round 2.\n\n1. **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n   - **Outside offer value:** 571\n   - **Item values:** Item 1: 79, Item 2: 41, Item 3: 21, Item 4: 97, Item 5: 55\n   - **Total items:** Item 1: 5, Item 2: 5, Item 3: 5, Item 4: 2, Item 5: 6\n   - **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that outcomes in later rounds are worth less than outcomes in earlier rounds.\n\n2. **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer:** [2, 2, 0, 1, 2] (what is offered *to* me). This means I would receive:\n      - 2 units of item 1\n      - 2 units of item 2\n      - 0 units of item 3\n      - 1 unit of item 4\n      - 2 units of item 5\n\n      My value for this offer is:\n      (2 * 79) + (2 * 41) + (0 * 21) + (1 * 97) + (2 * 55) = 158 + 82 + 0 + 97 + 110 = 447\n\n      Since 447 < 571, accepting this offer is worse than walking away and taking my outside offer *in this round*.  However, we must consider the possibility of a better offer.\n      Since it is round 2, accepting has a value of 447 * 0.9 = 402.3.\n      Accepting this is definitely worse than walking away.\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:**  I need to propose an offer that Player 1 might accept, while also giving me a value greater than 571 * 0.9 = 513.9.  I also want to avoid the mistake of making an offer worse than my previous offer to Player 1 ([2, 2, 2, 1, 2]), and worse than the current offer on the table [2, 2, 0, 1, 2].\n\n   Let's examine the previous offers from player 1 to consider what is minimally acceptable:\n   Round 1: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 0, 1, 2]\n   Round 2: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 0, 1, 2]\n   Player 1 appears to want at least 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n\n   To beat my outside offer, let's try giving Player 1 exactly that: [2, 2, 0, 1, 2]\n   That means I would keep:\n      - 3 units of item 1\n      - 3 units of item 2\n      - 5 units of item 3\n      - 1 unit of item 4\n      - 4 units of item 5\n   My value would be:\n      (3 * 79) + (3 * 41) + (5 * 21) + (1 * 97) + (4 * 55) = 237 + 123 + 105 + 97 + 220 = 782\n   Since 782 > 571, this is a worthwhile outcome.\n\n3. **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   - Accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n   - I can propose a counteroffer that benefits me more than my outside offer and is potentially acceptable to Player 1.\n\nTherefore, I will propose the counteroffer [2, 2, 0, 1, 2].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 0, 1, 2]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.
