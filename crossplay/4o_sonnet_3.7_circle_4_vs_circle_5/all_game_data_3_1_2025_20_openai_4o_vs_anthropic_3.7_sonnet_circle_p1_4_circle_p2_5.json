                    "response": "To determine my initial action, I need to analyze the scenario step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **My Outside Offer Value:** 972\n- **Values of the Items to Me:**\n  - Item 1: 58\n  - Item 2: 60\n  - Item 3: 99\n  - Item 4: 48\n  - Item 5: 3\n- **Total Pool of Items:**\n  - Item 1: 8 units\n  - Item 2: 2 units\n  - Item 3: 4 units\n  - Item 4: 5 units\n  - Item 5: 4 units\n\nTo maximize my value, I should consider the items with the highest value per unit for me, which are Item 3 and Item 2, followed by Item 1, Item 4, and Item 5 in descending order.\n\n- **Discount Factor:** Not applicable for the first round action.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer on the Table:** None (I'm making the first offer)\n  \nI need to construct an initial offer for Player 2 that maximizes my retained value while still being a realistic starting point for negotiation. Ideally, this offer should allow room for negotiation while ensuring the value remains above my outside offer.\n\nFor example, I want to keep all units of Item 3 and Item 2, given their high value to me. I can offer more units of the lower-valued items (to me) like Item 5 to Player 2.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nI will make my initial offer based on the analysis above to ensure my total value remains above my outside offer.\n\nLet's calculate an example division:\n\n- **Items I Give to Player 2:**\n  - 3 units of Item 1\n  - 0 units of Item 2\n  - 0 units of Item 3\n  - 2 units of Item 4\n  - 4 units of Item 5\n\n**Calculation of My Retained Value:**\n\n- Item 1: 5 units x 58 = 290\n- Item 2: 2 units x 60 = 120\n- Item 3: 4 units x 99 = 396\n- Item 4: 3 units x 48 = 144\n- Item 5: 0 units x 3 = 0\n\n**Total Value to Me: 950**\n\nThe total value retained (950) is below my outside offer value of 972. Hence, I need to adjust the offer:\n\n### Revised Offer\n\nTo ensure my retained value is higher, I need to adjust this retainment:\n\n- **Items I Give to Player 2:**\n  - 3 units of Item 1\n  - 0 units of Item 2\n  - 0 units of Item 3\n  - 3 units of Item 4\n  - 3 units of Item 5\n\n**Revised Calculation:**\n\n- Item 1: 5 units x 58 = 290\n- Item 2: 2 units x 60 = 120\n- Item 3: 4 units x 99 = 396\n- Item 4: 2 units x 48 = 96\n- Item 5: 1 unit x 3 = 3\n\n**Total Value to Me: 905**\n\nMy offer still keeps my value below my outside offer, so I will reduce the units given for items that have lower value:\n\n- **Final Offer to Player 2:**\n  - 2 units of Item 1\n  - 0 units of Item 2\n  - 0 units of Item 3\n  - 2 units of Item 4\n  - 3 units of Item 5\n\n**Final Retained Value Calculation:**\n\n- Item 1: 6 units x 58 = 348\n- Item 2: 2 units x 60 = 120\n- Item 3: 4 units x 99 = 396\n- Item 4: 3 units x 48 = 144\n- Item 5: 1 unit x 3 = 3\n\n**Final Total Value to Me: 1011**\n\nThis final offer keeps my value above my outside offer, giving me 1011, which is better than my fallback value of 972. \n\nThus, my action will be:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 0, 2, 3]}\n```",

Your value would be:\n    91 x 7 + 47 x 2 + 88 x 4 + 65 x 4 + 15 x 4\n    which is 1403 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1404. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "To make an informed decision, let's go through the step-by-step analysis:\n\n### 1) Analyze the Current Situation:\n\n- **Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer value is 972.\n  \n- **Values of the Items**:\n  - Item 1: 58 per unit\n  - Item 2: 60 per unit\n  - Item 3: 99 per unit\n  - Item 4: 48 per unit\n  - Item 5: 3 per unit\n\n- **Total Pool of Items**:\n  - 8 units of item 1\n  - 2 units of item 2\n  - 4 units of item 3\n  - 5 units of item 4\n  - 4 units of item 5\n\n- **Discount Factor**: Since it's round 2, the effective value of any deal will be discounted by \\( \\gamma^{(2-1)} = 0.9 \\).\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n\n- **Current Offer**: [0, 0, 0, 1, 3] offered to me.\n  - Value of the offer to me:\n    - 0 units of item 1 = 0\n    - 0 units of item 2 = 0\n    - 0 units of item 3 = 0\n    - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 48 = 48\n    - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9\n  - Total value = 48 + 9 = 57\n  - Discounted value in round 2 = 57 \u00d7 0.9 = 51.3\n\n- **Comparison to Outside Offer**: The discounted value of 51.3 is much lower than my outside offer value of 972. Accepting this offer would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\n\n- **Potential Counteroffers**: I need to propose a counteroffer that gives a value to me greater than 972 after discount in round 3 (values will be further discounted by 0.9 again):\n  - Since the sum of my present values of all items is 1232, and my outside offer is 972, I should aim for a division where my share provides a value greater than 1080 when factoring in a discount for round 3.\n\nFor the best possible counteroffer, I'll aim to secure high-value items, such as item 3, in larger quantities.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision:\n\nGiven the analysis above:\n- I should not accept the current offer as it provides much less value than my outside offer.\n- Walking away is not advisable yet since I could secure a better counteroffer.\n- I should make a counteroffer that ensures my share's value outweighs my discounted outside offer. Here\u2019s a proposed counteroffer: [1, 0, 0, 0, 2]\n\n### Calculating My Counteroffer Value:\n\n- **Keep for myself**:\n  - 7 units of item 1 (7 \u00d7 58 = 406)\n  - 2 units of item 2 (2 \u00d7 60 = 120)\n  - 4 units of item 3 (4 \u00d7 99 = 396)\n  - 5 units of item 4 (5 \u00d7 48 = 240)\n  - 2 units of item 5 (2 \u00d7 3 = 6)\n  - Total value = 406 + 120 + 396 + 240 + 6 = 1,168\n\n- **Discounted value in round 3** (assuming Player 2 accepts): \n  - 1,168 \u00d7 \\(0.9^2\\) = 945.84, which is still below my outside option, meaning I will need player 2 to propose a better alternative in round 3 if they reject this offer.\n\nTherefore, the result is a calculated, considered offer from me:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 0, 2]}\n```",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 1404. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1404. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 918 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [7, 2, 4, 4, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    91 x 7 + 47 x 2 + 88 x 4 + 65 x 4 + 15 x 4\n    which is 1403 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1404. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 169. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 618 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 0, 6, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    48 x 1 + 44 x 0 + 90 x 0 + 16 x 6 + 8 x 3\n    which is 168 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 169. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 2, 3, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 0, 2, 3, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

It only has 2 units, so I will aim to keep both units.\n   - Item 1 is the next highest at 74, with 7 units to divide.\n\n2. **Offer Calculation:**\n   - If I keep 5 units of Item 1, I can offer 2 units to Player 2.\n   - Prioritize offering lower-value items to Player 2 after ensuring I keep enough to exceed the outside value.\n\n**Offer to Player 2:** (2 units of Item 1, 3 units of Item 2, 4 units of Item 3, 3 units of Item 4, 0 units of Item 5)\n\n- **Calculate My Value of Keeping:**\n  - Item 1: 5 units \u00d7 74 = 370\n  - Item 2: 2 units \u00d7 45 = 90\n  - Item 3: 4 units \u00d7 38 = 152\n  - Item 4: 2 units \u00d7 2 = 4\n  - Item 5: 2 units \u00d7 84 = 168\n  - **Total**: 370 + 90 + 152 + 4 + 168 = 784\n  \nAdjusting the offer to ensure my value is above 813, since 784 is not enough:\n\nKeep 6 units of item 1:\n\n- **Calculate My Value of Keeping Again:**\n  - Item 1: 6 units \u00d7 74 = 444\n  - Item 2: 2 units \u00d7 45 = 90\n  - Item 3: 4 units \u00d7 38 = 152\n  - Item 4: 2 units \u00d7 2 = 4\n  - Item 5: 2 units \u00d7 84 = 168\n  - **Total**: 444 + 90 + 152 + 4 + 168 = 858\n  \n858 ensures my value is higher than my outside offer. \n\nFinal Offer: (1 unit of Item 1, 3 units of Item 2, 4 units of Item 3, 3 units of Item 4, 0 units of Item 5)\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\nI should propose a counteroffer that optimizes my position, ensuring my value is greater than my outside offer value.\n\n**Proposed COUNTEROFFER:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 3, 4, 3, 0]}\n```\n\nThis offer maximizes my retained value while providing a reasonable division for Player 2 to consider.",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 7, 4, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    46 x 0 + 74 x 1 + 77 x 7 + 78 x 4 + 19 x 1\n    which is 944 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 945. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 4, 3, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 3, 4, 3, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 7, 4, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    46 x 0 + 74 x 1 + 77 x 7 + 78 x 4 + 19 x 1\n    which is 944 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 945. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 4, 3, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [4, 2, 3, 2, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 2, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 2, 2, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 310. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 351 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 2, 4, 2, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    25 x 1 + 28 x 2 + 2 x 4 + 30 x 2 + 32 x 5\n    which is 309 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 310. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 3, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 2, 3, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

Therefore, it would be preferable to come to a resolution sooner rather than later to maximize my outcome.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n#### Current Offer:\n- There is no current offer from Player 2 on the table.\n\n#### Potential Counteroffers:\n- For any counteroffer, I must ensure its value to me is greater than my outside offer value of 31.\n- At a minimum, I should aim to receive items whose total value to me exceeds the outside offer when multiplied by the discount factor for each round.\n\n#### Calculation for Total Value of All Items:\n- Total value of all items to me:\n  - 1 unit of Item 1: 1 \u00d7 44 = 44\n  - 5 units of Item 2: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15\n  - 5 units of Item 3: 5 \u00d7 25 = 125\n  - 4 units of Item 4: 4 \u00d7 63 = 252\n  - 7 units of Item 5: 7 \u00d7 70 = 490\n- Total Value = 926\n\nTo stay above my outside offer value in potential counteroffers, I should ensure that the items I keep are worth significantly more than 31, especially after future rounds' reductions from the discount factor.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nSince it is round 1, I should make a reasonable counteroffer that I suspect gives me a significant value over my outside offer, and is also attractive enough for Player 2 not to immediately reject it.\n\nHere\u2019s a potential first offer:\n- Offer Player 2:\n  - 0 units of Item 1 (value to me = 0)\n  - 5 units of Item 2 (value to me = 15)\n  - 2 units of Item 3 (value to me = 50)\n  - 1 unit of Item 4 (value to me = 63)\n  - 3 units of Item 5 (value to me = 210)\n\nValue of items I'm keeping:\n- 1 unit of Item 1: 44\n- 0 units of Item 2: 0\n- 3 units of Item 3: 75\n- 3 units of Item 4: 189\n- 4 units of Item 5: 280\n- Total value to me: 588\n\nThis exceeds my outside offer significantly.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 407. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 708 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions.

This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 2, 2, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    92 x 0 + 37 x 0 + 34 x 2 + 25 x 2 + 48 x 6\n    which is 406 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 407. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 283. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 621 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

If the negotiation concludes in the second round, each player's value for the outcome is multiplied by 0.9. This means if I accept a deal, its effective value is 90% of its face value in terms of my item valuation.\n\n### 2) Assess the value of offers:\n- **For the current offer: What is my total value if I accept it?**\n  - Current Offer: [1, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n    - Value = 1 \u00d7 40 (Item 1) + 1 \u00d7 67 (Item 2) + 0 \u00d7 28 (Item 3) + 1 \u00d7 41 (Item 4) + 1 \u00d7 31 (Item 5) \n    - = 40 + 67 + 0 + 41 + 31 \n    - = 179\n  - Value after discount = 179 \u00d7 0.9 = 161.1\n\n- **How do these values compare to my outside offer value?**\n  - My discounted value for the current offer (161.1) is less than my outside offer value (283).\n\n### 3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\nGiven that the current offer's discounted value is significantly lower than my outside offer, I should not ACCEPT the current offer. Instead, I need to propose a counteroffer that results in a value greater than my outside offer, or I might decide to walk if such a counteroffer seems unlikely to be accepted. \n\nLet's consider strategic counteroffers:\n1. **A potential beneficial counteroffer:**\n   - To maximize my gains without threatening the negotiation, I will provide a counteroffer that aims to give me a value better than my outside offer of 283 while being potentially acceptable to Player 2.\n\n2. **Calculate a counteroffer that might be acceptable:**\n   - I can take 3 units of item 1 (120 value for me), 2 units of item 2 (134), 1 unit of item 3 (28), 2 units of item 4 (82), and 1 unit of item 5 (31). \n   - My value would be: 3 \u00d7 40 + 2 \u00d7 67 + 1 \u00d7 28 + 2 \u00d7 41 + 1 \u00d7 31 = 120 + 134 + 28 + 82 + 31 = 395 (Before discount)\n   - Discounted value = 395 \u00d7 0.9 = 355.5, which is better than my outside offer.\n\nHowever, the goal is to ensure that the offer is not too unfavorable for Player 2. Let's propose a slightly modified version that might be seen as more balanced:\n   \nCounteroffer: [1, 1, 1, 2, 1] offered to Player 2.\n- For me: [3, 2, 0, 2, 1] (value 355.5)\n\nPropose this as a counteroffer, making sure not to fall into any mistake.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 2, 1]}",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    59 x 1 + 33 x 1 + 92 x 1 + 82 x 1 + 73 x 1\n    which is 339 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 340. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

However, since we will either ACCEPT or WALK in this final round, we should primarily consider the adjusted values versus the outside offer.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n   - **Current offer from Player 2 ([2, 3, 0, 0, 0]):** \n     - 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 95 = 190\n     - 3 units of item 2: 3 \u00d7 83 = 249\n     - 0 units of item 3: 0 \u00d7 9 = 0\n     - 0 units of item 4: 0 \u00d7 84 = 0\n     - 0 units of item 5: 0 \u00d7 64 = 0\n     - Total value = 439\n     - Adjusted value with discount factor (round 3): 439 \u00d7 (0.9^2) = 356.31 approximately\n\n   - **Comparison to outside offer:** My outside offer is 1118, which is significantly higher than the adjusted value of accepting Player 2's current offer (356.31).\n\n3) **Make a Decision Based on the Analysis:**\n   - **ACCEPT:** Accepting the current offer yields a current value of 356.31, which is far less than my outside offer of 1118.\n   - **WALK:** Walking away guarantees me 1118, which is my outside offer.\n   - **COUNTEROFFER:** Given this is the last round, any counteroffer made by me would effectively lead to walking away if it's not accepted, due to the rules.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the best course of action is to walk away, as my guaranteed outside offer of 1118 provides significantly more value than the adjusted value of accepting the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items.

This means if I accept an offer in round 2, my value is multiplied by 0.9.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer to Me:** [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n  - My value if I accept: 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 2 = 2\n\n- **Potential Counteroffers:**\n  I will consider what offers maintain a value better than my outside offer of 769 or as close to it, without exceeding the total available number of each item. For example:\n\n  - **Offer Proposal [2, 0, 0, 4, 5] (keeping more valuable items):**\n    - My value calculation if I take 3 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 2 of item 4, all of item 5:\n      - Item 1: 3 \u00d7 12 = 36\n      - Item 2: 4 \u00d7 40 = 160\n      - Item 3: 1 \u00d7 2 = 2\n      - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 93 = 186\n      - Item 5: 0 \u00d7 44 = 0\n    - Total value = 384 (does not meet my outside offer value, needs adjustment)\n\n  I need an offer that gives me more value than my outside offer, considering the discount rate.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\n- **Current Offer:**\n  - Only valued at 2, which is far less than my outside offer value of 769.\n\n- **Decision:**\n  Since the current offer does not meet my outside offer, and to avoid taking less valuable items, I have to walk away unless I'm sure a strategic counteroffer can lead to a better result:\n\nGiven that I'm on round 2, rather than making a fruitless counteroffer, I will WALK away since the value is significantly less than my fallback option.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 323. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 675 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 4, 2, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    34 x 0 + 59 x 4 + 39 x 2 + 8 x 1 + 85 x 0\n    which is 322 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 323. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 1, 2, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    59 x 0 + 29 x 1 + 34 x 1 + 14 x 2 + 64 x 5\n    which is 411 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 412. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Let's adjust our offer:\n\nConsider another scenario where:\n  - Item 1: 0 units (value retained = 60)\n  - Item 2: 1 unit (value retained = 4 * 25 = 100)\n  - Item 3: 0 units (value retained = 78)\n  - Item 4: 4 units (value retained = 2 * 32 = 64)\n  - Item 5: 1 unit (value retained = 6)\n\n  Total value of items retained:\n  - Value = 60 + 100 + 78 + 64 + 6 = 308\n\nAgain, the value is below 326. Adjusting more aggressively, try:\n\nConsider another scenario where:\n  - Item 1: 0 units (value retained = 60)\n  - Item 2: 1 unit (value retained = 4 * 25 = 100)\n  - Item 3: 1 unit (value retained = 0)\n  - Item 4: 5 units (value retained = 1 * 32 = 32)\n  - Item 5: 0 unit (value retained = 12)\n\n  Total value of items retained:\n  - Value = 60 + 100 + 0 + 32 + 12 = 204\n\nThe retained value of 204 is again below 326, meaning the above configuration does not offer more value than my outside offer.\n\n### Step 3: Make a decision\n\n- **Optimal action on round 1:**  \n  Since I haven't found a division where my value from the items retained is greater than my outside offer of 326, it is advisable to start with a strong counteroffer to maximize value without exceeding my outside offer.\n\nCurrently, during my analysis, it seems reasonable to propose retaining the highest-value items and offer Player 2 less critical items in order to potentially attain a value equal or greater than my outside offer but still making a feasible negotiation.\n\nI decide to go for a more aggressive negotiation while still ensuring I offer a configuration better aligned with my strategy aiming above 326 in subsequent rounds.\n\nI offer Player 2 the following split, which should maximize my retained value based on what I've evaluated above:\n\nOffer:\n- Player 2 gets: \n  - Item 1: 0 unit\n  - Item 2: 2 units\n  - Item 3: 1 unit\n  - Item 4: 5 units\n  - Item 5: 1 unit\n\nMy retained value is:\n- Item 1: 60\n- Item 2: 3 * 25 = 75\n- Item 4: 1 * 32 = 32\n- Item 5: 1 * 6 = 6\n- Total retained = 60 + 75 + 32 + 6 = 173\n\nHowever, this total value when retained does not come close to my outside offer. I need a higher retained value, however, for an initial offer, it gives room for bargaining. Making sure the proposal yearns to get P2 into making further acceptable negotiations or counteroffers better than 215.\n\nGiven the constraints and analysis above, my more reasonable action is to start with a division that has potential to increase value for P2 than offering or yielding too much outright:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 1, 5, 1]}",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 380. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 380. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 753 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 3, 1, 5, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    60 x 1 + 52 x 3 + 71 x 1 + 6 x 5 + 62 x 1\n    which is 379 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 380. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 1, 5, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 1, 5, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Let's try one more:\n   \n   If I offer [0, 2, 0, 6, 0]:\n   - I keep: 1 unit of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5\n   - Value: (1\u00d760) + (3\u00d752) + (1\u00d771) + (0\u00d76) + (2\u00d762) = 60 + 156 + 71 + 0 + 124 = 411\n   \n   This is above my outside offer of 380, and seems reasonable.\n\nDecision: I'll make a counteroffer where I give Player 1 [0, 2, 0, 6, 0].

I should aim for a value of at least 326 in the third round to avoid mistake 2 (offering worse than the outside offer after discounting).\n\n     - Example counteroffer: \n       [0, 2, 0, 5, 0] - Giving 2 units of Item 2 and 5 units of Item 4.\n         - My units of:\n\n           Item 1: 1 \u00d7 60 = 60\n           Item 2: 3 \u00d7 25 = 75\n           Item 3: 1 \u00d7 78 = 78\n           Item 4: 1 \u00d7 32 = 32\n           Item 5: 2 \u00d7 6 = 12\n\n       - Total value = 60 + 75 + 78 + 32 + 12 = 257\n       - Discounted value in round 3 = 257 \u00d7 0.9^2 = 208.77\n\n     This is less than the outside offer.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 380. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 753 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 3, 1, 5, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    60 x 1 + 52 x 3 + 71 x 1 + 6 x 5 + 62 x 1\n    which is 379 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 380. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 1, 5, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 2, 0, 6, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

This is because Player 1 is only asking for 2 units of my lowest-value item.\n\nSince the current offer is excellent for me (keeping almost everything except 2 units of my lowest-value item), I should accept it rather than countering.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [5, 4, 2, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 5, 2, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 5, 2, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To decide on the best action, we'll systematically analyze each step of the negotiation scenario:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the current situation\n\n1. **Outside Offer Value**: Your outside offer value is 292.\n   \n2. **Values of Items**: Your values per item unit are:\n   - Item 1: 14\n   - Item 2: 74\n   - Item 3: 19\n   - Item 4: 93\n   - Item 5: 95\n\n3. **Total Pool of Items**: \n   - Item 1: 5 units\n   - Item 2: 7 units\n   - Item 3: 3 units\n   - Item 4: 2 units\n   - Item 5: 0 units\n\n4. **Discount Factor Influence**: The discount factor gamma is 0.9, so the value of any agreement reached in round 2 will be multiplied by 0.9.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the value of offers\n\n- **Current Offer (from Player 2):** [0, 5, 2, 0, 0].\n\n  Calculate the total value of this offer to you:\n  - Item 1: 0 units x 14 = 0\n  - Item 2: 5 units x 74 = 370\n  - Item 3: 2 units x 19 = 38\n  - Item 4: 0 units x 93 = 0\n  - Item 5: 0 units x 95 = 0\n  - Total Value = 370 + 38 = 408\n  - After discount (since we're in round 2): 408 x 0.9 = 367.2\n\n- **Potential Counteroffer Analysis**:\n  Let's consider a possible counteroffer. We need a counteroffer where our received value exceeds 292, especially after considering the round 2 discount.\n\n  E.g., Offer yourself more units of higher-valued items, and less to Player 2:\n  Proposed distribution:\n  - Offer Player 2: [1, 5, 1, 1, 0]\n  - Keeping for yourself: [4, 2, 2, 1, 0]\n\n  **Calculate value for yourself:**\n  - Item 1: 4 units x 14 = 56\n  - Item 2: 2 units x 74 = 148\n  - Item 3: 2 units x 19 = 38\n  - Item 4: 1 unit x 93 = 93\n  - Item 5: 0 units x 95 = 0\n  - Total Value = 56 + 148 + 38 + 93 = 335\n  - After discount 0.9 for round 2: 335 x 0.9 = 301.5\n\n  This value is higher than your outside offer.\n\n### Step 3: Make a decision based on analysis\n\n- **Accept Current Offer?** The value (367.2) is higher than your outside offer (292).\n\nBased on this analysis, it would make sense to **ACCEPT** Player 2's current offer since it exceeds the value of your outside offer even after the discount.

Specifically, the value in round 2 would be multiplied by 0.9, and in round 3 by 0.9^2.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\nNo current offer is on the table as it is round 1, and I'm making the initial offer.\n\n**Value of My Current Full Share**: 582\n\nSince the negotiation starts, I can make an initial offer to maximize my value while trying to get acceptance from Player 2. \n\nTo satisfy my guaranteed fallback value of 436, my intended counteroffer should ensure that after Player 2 accepts the negotiation overall, I should expect a result greater than or equal to my outside offer value. \n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision Based on the Analysis\n\nTo craft the offer, I want to ensure my outcome is greater than 436 and make it realistic for Player 2 to accept:\n\n- **Items Allocation Proposal to Player 2**:\n  - Offer Player 2 some lower-valued or excess quantity units while ensuring I retain substantial value.\n\nExample Initial Offer:\n- Item 1: 0 units to Player 2 (I keep 3 units)\n- Item 2: 3 units to Player 2 (I keep 1 unit)\n- Item 3: 1 unit to Player 2 (I keep 1 unit)\n- Item 4: 2 units to Player 2 (I keep 2 units)\n- Item 5: 2 units to Player 2 (I keep 3 units)\n\n**Calculations**:\n- I retain: \n  - 3 units of Item 1: 3 \u00d7 57 = 171\n  - 1 unit of Item 2: 1 \u00d7 4 = 4\n  - 1 unit of Item 3: 1 \u00d7 50 = 50\n  - 2 units of Item 4: 2 \u00d7 10 = 20\n  - 3 units of Item 5: 3 \u00d7 51 = 153\n\nTotal value for me: 171 + 4 + 50 + 20 + 153 = 398\n\nEven though 398 is lower than my outside offer, I need to consider that this is only round 1, enabling additional negotiation rounds where I can adjust for my final target. \n\nGiven the discount factor and nature of negotiation, offering Player 2 some items could be strategic, thus introducing an enticing offer for their acceptance. \n\nHence, this first action is to issue a COUNTEROFFER given the absence of a proposal:\n\n```plaintext\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 1, 2, 2]}\n```\n\nThis initial proposal gives me more room to negotiate in subsequent rounds while keeping the negotiation window open.",

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 436. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 516 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 3, 1, 2, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 3, 0, 2, 5]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 3, 0, 2, 5]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Let's analyze the current situation, step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **My Outside Offer Value:** 436\n- **Values of the Items to Me:**\n  - Item 1: 57 per unit\n  - Item 2: 4 per unit\n  - Item 3: 50 per unit\n  - Item 4: 10 per unit\n  - Item 5: 51 per unit\n- **Total Pool of Items:** 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5.\n- **Discount Factor Influence:** Given the discount factor \\(\\gamma = 0.9\\), any delayed negotiation conclusion will reduce the effective value to me by this factor. Thus, if the negotiation concludes in round 2 (current round), my outcome value would be multiplied by \\(0.9^{1} = 0.9\\). If it goes to round 3, it will be multiplied by \\(0.9^{2} = 0.81\\).\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n**Current Offer (from Player 2): [0, 3, 0, 2, 5]**\n\n- My values:\n  - 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 57 = 0\n  - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12\n  - 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 50 = 0\n  - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 10 = 20\n  - 5 units of item 5 = 5 \u00d7 51 = 255\n- Total value to me = 0 + 12 + 0 + 20 + 255 = 287\n- After applying the discount: 287 \u00d7 0.9 = 258.3\n\n**Comparison with Outside Offer:**\n\n- My outside offer value is 436. The current offer's effective value to me is 258.3, which is significantly less than my outside offer.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nGiven that the current offer's discounted value (258.3) is much less than my guaranteed outside offer value (436), accepting the current offer would be a bad decision. Let's consider a counteroffer:\n\nSince rounds are limited (we are in round 2 and can offer only once more before the final decision round), I need a counteroffer aiming for a value significantly higher than my current offer and at least equal to my outside offer before the discount. An aggressive stance could be taking nearly all high-value items:\n\n**Counteroffer: [0, 4, 0, 3, 0]**\n\n- Calculating my value in this counteroffer:\n  - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171\n  - 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 4 = 0\n  - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 50 = 100\n  - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 10 = 10\n  - 5 units of item 5 = 5 \u00d7 51 = 255\n- Total value = 171 + 0 + 100 + 10 + 255 = 536\n- After applying the discount: 536 \u00d7 0.9 = 482.4\n\nThis offer is considerably better than both my current offer and my outside offer when adjusted for discount, therefore, it is a rational and assertive counteroffer. \n\n### Action:\n\nTherefore, I will proceed with the following action:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 4, 0, 3, 0]}\n```",

For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 2, 4, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    88 x 0 + 30 x 0 + 100 x 2 + 72 x 4 + 37 x 2\n    which is 562 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 563. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

To maximize my outcome while ensuring it\u2019s more than my outside offer, I will propose an offer that reasonably divides the items but keeps items of higher value to me.\n\nLet's propose a counteroffer that keeps my total well above my outside offer and also aims for a first round agreement to minimize discount impacts in following rounds.\n\nA reasonable division could be focusing more on retaining item 3, as it has the highest value to me, while offering some items to Player 2. Here's a proposed offer:\n\n- Offer Player 2:\n  - Item 1: 3 units\n  - Item 2: 2 units\n  - Item 3: 2 units\n  - Item 4: 1 units\n  - Item 5: 2 units\n\n**Calculation for this offer**:\n- My kept units and value:\n  - Item 1: 4 units \u00d7 19 = 76\n  - Item 2: 2 units \u00d7 29 = 58\n  - Item 3: 5 units \u00d7 85 = 425\n  - Item 4: 2 units \u00d7 43 = 86\n  - Item 5: 4 units \u00d7 56 = 224\n- Total value to me = 76 + 58 + 425 + 86 + 224 = 869\n\nUpon assessing, the value of 869 is lower than my outside offer of 993. Consequently, I must adjust the offer to secure a better outcome.\n\nA better offer could be:\n- Offer Player 2:\n  - Item 1: 3 units (I keep 4 units)\n  - Item 2: 1 unit (I keep 3 units)\n  - Item 3: 1 unit (I keep 6 units)\n  - Item 4: 1 unit (I keep 2 units)\n  - Item 5: 2 units (I keep 4 units)\n\n**Calculation for this adjusted offer**:\n- My kept units and value:\n  - Item 1: 4 units \u00d7 19 = 76\n  - Item 2: 3 units \u00d7 29 = 87\n  - Item 3: 6 units \u00d7 85 = 510\n  - Item 4: 2 units \u00d7 43 = 86\n  - Item 5: 4 units \u00d7 56 = 224\n- Total value to me = 76 + 87 + 510 + 86 + 224 = 983\n\nThis value (983) is greater than my outside offer (993 after adjusting for mistakes) and gives me a good negotiation threshold for future rounds.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 993. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 696 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 1, 1, 1, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 3, 0, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 3, 0, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

The expected value should instead prioritize the high value of item 3 or distribute items accordingly, maintaining gameplay constraints.\n\nGiven the limited scope of feasible offers without strong assumptions yet known outcomes, walking away might be more suitable, but I intend offering elements with differences in item priorities to encourage acceptance.\n\n**Action:**\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 3, 2, 3]}",

Even if I keep all items, I'd get (665 + 204 + 168 + 243 + 192) \u00d7 0.9 = 1324.8, which is still less than my outside offer.\n\nGiven that any deal at this point would be worse than my outside offer when accounting for the discount factor, the rational choice is to walk away.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

                    "response": "To determine the best action, let's evaluate the situation step-by-step as instructed.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer value is 427. This is my guaranteed value if I choose to walk away.\n\n- **Values of the Items**:\n  - Item 1: 12 per unit\n  - Item 2: 85 per unit\n  - Item 3: 71 per unit\n  - Item 4: 95 per unit\n  - Item 5: 60 per unit\n\n- **Total Pool of Items**:\n  - Item 1: 5 units\n  - Item 2: 2 units\n  - Item 3: 8 units\n  - Item 4: 3 units\n  - Item 5: 7 units\n\n- **Discount Factor**: Since we are in round 1, there is no immediate effect of the discount factor (gamma = 0.9) to consider when making the first offer or counteroffer.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\nSince there is no current offer to evaluate, I need to assess potential offers. I'll aim to create a counteroffer that, when evaluated based on my item values, ensures the total value exceeds my outside offer of 427.\n\nLet's calculate my total value based on different scenarios of keeping some units of each item:\n\nIf I propose giving 3 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 4 units of item 5 to Player 2, the calculation for what I get to keep is:\n\n- 2 units of item 1 for me: 2 * 12 = 24\n- 1 unit of item 2 for me: 1 * 85 = 85\n- 4 units of item 3 for me: 4 * 71 = 284\n- 2 units of item 4 for me: 2 * 95 = 190\n- 3 units of item 5 for me: 3 * 60 = 180\n\nTotal value of this proposed division for me is 763.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\n- My proposed counteroffer gives me a value of 763, which is significantly higher than my outside offer value of 427. Therefore, it makes sense to proceed with this offer rather than walking away or proposing something worse.\n\n- The offer also avoids mistakes such as Mistake 1 and Mistake 2 detailed above.\n\nTherefore, my action will be to propose the following counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 1, 4, 1, 4]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 2, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    14 x 0 + 10 x 1 + 100 x 0 + 54 x 2 + 62 x 5\n    which is 428 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 429. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items.

This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    15 x 0 + 84 x 1 + 45 x 0 + 15 x 0 + 20 x 0\n    which is 84 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 85. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "To determine the best action, let's assess the current situation and evaluate potential decisions step-by-step based on the given details.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer value is 574.\n\n- **Values of Items Involved**:\n  - Item 1: 37 per unit\n  - Item 2: 14 per unit\n  - Item 3: 79 per unit\n  - Item 4: 78 per unit\n  - Item 5: 87 per unit\n\n- **Total Pool of Items**:\n  - 7 units of item 1\n  - 7 units of item 2\n  - 1 unit of item 3\n  - 0 units of item 4\n  - 4 units of item 5\n\n- **Discount Factor**:\n  - The discount rate is 0.9, meaning the value of an outcome is multiplied by 0.9 for round 2 and by 0.81 (i.e., \\(0.9^2\\)) for round 3. This means delaying agreement reduces value due to discounting.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n1. **Current Offer**: There is no current offer to evaluate.\n\n2. **Evaluate Potential Counteroffers**:\n\n   We must ensure any counteroffer is worth more than my outside offer value of 574. Let's consider potential value for myself with different allocations and ensure that I propose a beneficial allocation.\n\n   - **All Items Value**:\n      - Item 1: 7 \u00d7 37 = 259\n      - Item 2: 7 \u00d7 14 = 98\n      - Item 3: 1 \u00d7 79 = 79\n      - Item 5: 4 \u00d7 87 = 348\n      - Total Value: 259 + 98 + 79 + 348 = 784\n\n   - **Needed Minimum Value**:\n     - We need a total of at least 574, as this is my outside offer value.\n\nLet's find a division that achieves this value for myself:\n\n- Proposal:\n  - Give Player 2: 4 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, and 3 units of item 5.\n\n  **Calculating My Value**:\n   - Keeping 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 37 = 111\n   - Keeping 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 14 = 28\n   - Keeping 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 79 = 79\n   - Keeping 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 87 = 87\n   - Total: 111 + 28 + 79 + 87 = 305\n\n  This is less than 574, so let's re-evaluate offering less to Player 2 to meet my needs.\n\n- New Proposal:\n  - Give Player 2: 0 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 3 units of item 5.\n  \n  **Calculating My Value**:\n   - Keeping all 7 units of item 1: 7 \u00d7 37 = 259\n   - Keeping 4 units of item 2: 4 \u00d7 14 = 56\n   - Keeping the only unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 79 = 79\n   - Keeping 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 87 = 87\n   - Total: 259 + 56 + 79 + 87 = 481\n   \n  Still below 574.\n\n- Final Proposal Here:\n  - Give Player 2: 0 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 2 units of item 5.\n\n  **Calculating My Value**:\n   - Keeping all 7 units of item 1: 7 \u00d7 37 = 259\n   - Keeping 5 units of item 2: 5 \u00d7 14 = 70\n   - Keeping the only unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 79 = 79\n   - Keeping 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 87 = 174\n   - Total: 259 + 70 + 79 + 174 = 582\n\n  This is greater than my outside offer value of 574, ensuring this decision is favorable.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\n- **Action**: Propose a counteroffer since none is present, and I've calculated a division beneficial to me.\n\nGiven my evaluation, the offer that would maximize my benefit while proposing negotiation would be:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]}\n```\n\nThis offer ensures that I meet my necessary value threshold while leaving room for potential reciprocity from Player 2.",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis.

For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 4, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    45 x 0 + 93 x 4 + 92 x 0 + 26 x 0 + 87 x 0\n    which is 372 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 385. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

I need a division that provides me more value.\n\nPropose a counteroffer:\n- Let\u2019s try to create a counteroffer with higher value for me, keeping more high-value items (like item 5 and item 3).\n\nProposing:\n- Since I should maximize my value, let's ensure I capitalize on high-value items:\n   - Offer Player 2: [5, 4, 0, 0, 1] (keeping 2 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 1 of item 3, all of item 4, and 3 of item 5)\n\nLet's calculate this counteroffer's value:\n- Value of 2 units of item 1: \\( 2 \\times 37 = 74 \\)\n- Value of 3 units of item 2: \\( 3 \\times 14 = 42 \\)\n- Value of 1 unit of item 3: \\( 1 \\times 79 = 79 \\)\n- Value of 0 units of item 4: \\( 0 \\times 78 = 0 \\)\n- Value of 3 units of item 5: \\( 3 \\times 87 = 261 \\)\n- Total value: \\( 74 + 42 + 79 + 0 + 261 = 456 \\).\n\nEven when adjusted for gamma: \\( 456 \\times 0.9 = 410.4 \\), still less than 574.\n\nLet's try:\n- Offer Player 2: [4, 4, 0, 0, 1], keeping more of item 5.\n\nThis would give me:\n- Value of 3 units of item 1: \\( 3 \\times 37 = 111 \\)\n- Value of 3 units of item 2: \\( 3 \\times 14 = 42 \\)\n- Value of 1 unit of item 3: \\( 1 \\times 79 = 79 \\)\n- Value of 0 units of item 4: \\( 0 \\times 78 = 0 \\)\n- Value of 3 units of item 5: \\( 3 \\times 87 = 261 \\)\n- Total value: \\( 111 + 42 + 79 + 0 + 261 = 493 \\), adjusted becomes \\( 493 \\times 0.9 = 443.7 \\).\n\nThis still does not surpass 574. Nonetheless, a balanced distribution keeps maximum value. Given round processing constraints:\n- Offer Player 2: [6, 5, 0, 0, 0], reduces dramatic switch.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 4, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    45 x 0 + 93 x 4 + 92 x 0 + 26 x 0 + 87 x 0\n    which is 372 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 385. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 2, 0, 0, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [5, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [5, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 3, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    49 x 1 + 37 x 1 + 40 x 3 + 11 x 0 + 85 x 1\n    which is 291 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 292. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?
