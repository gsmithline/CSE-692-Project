This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "I need to develop an initial offer that will maximize my value while giving the other player enough to potentially accept.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the current situation\n\n- My outside offer value: 1058\n- My item values: \n  - Item 1: 47 per unit (4 units total)\n  - Item 2: 75 per unit (4 units total)\n  - Item 3: 76 per unit (5 units total)\n  - Item 4: 53 per unit (1 unit total)\n  - Item 5: 21 per unit (7 units total)\n- Total pool: 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 7 units of item 5\n- Discount factor: \u03b3 = 0.9, which means offers in future rounds will be worth less\n\n### Step 2: Assess potential offers\n\nI should rank the items by their value per unit to decide which ones I want to keep:\n1. Item 3: 76 (highest value)\n2. Item 2: 75\n3. Item 4: 53\n4. Item 1: 47\n5. Item 5: 21 (lowest value)\n\nThe total value of all items for me is:\n(4\u00d747) + (4\u00d775) + (5\u00d776) + (1\u00d753) + (7\u00d721) = 188 + 300 + 380 + 53 + 147 = 1068\n\nSince my outside offer is 1058, I need to keep items worth at least this much to make a deal worthwhile.\n\nLet me calculate a potential offer where I prioritize keeping the high-value items:\n- Keep all of items 2, 3, and 4 (my highest value items)\n- Keep 2 units of item 1\n- Give 2 units of item 1\n- Give all 7 units of item 5\n\nMy value from this proposal:\n(2\u00d747) + (4\u00d775) + (5\u00d776) + (1\u00d753) + (0\u00d721) = 94 + 300 + 380 + 53 + 0 = 827\n\nThis is below my outside offer value of 1058, so this isn't good enough.\n\nLet me try again:\n- Keep all of items 1, 2, 3, and 4\n- Give 0 units of items 1, 2, 3, and 4\n- Give 7 units of item 5\n\nMy value from this proposal:\n(4\u00d747) + (4\u00d775) + (5\u00d776) + (1\u00d753) + (0\u00d721) = 188 + 300 + 380 + 53 + 0 = 921\n\nStill below my outside offer.\n\nLet me try keeping most of everything:\n- Keep all of items 1, 2, 3, and 4\n- Keep 6 units of item 5\n- Give 0 units of items 1, 2, 3, and 4\n- Give 1 unit of item 5\n\nMy value from this proposal:\n(4\u00d747) + (4\u00d775) + (5\u00d776) + (1\u00d753) + (6\u00d721) = 188 + 300 + 380 + 53 + 126 = 1047\n\nThis is still slightly below my outside offer.\n\nLet me adjust again:\n- Keep all of items 1, 2, 3, and 4\n- Keep 7 units of item 5 (all of them)\n- Give 0 units of items 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5\n\nMy value from this proposal:\n(4\u00d747) + (4\u00d775) + (5\u00d776) + (1\u00d753) + (7\u00d721) = 188 + 300 + 380 + 53 + 147 = 1068\n\nThis exceeds my outside offer of 1058. However, offering nothing is considered a mistake (Mistake 3).\n\nLet me create a fair starting offer:\n- Keep all of items 2 and 3 (my highest value items)\n- Keep the one unit of item 4\n- Split item 1: keep 3, give 1\n- Split item 5: keep 5, give 2\n\nMy value from this proposal:\n(3\u00d747) + (4\u00d775) + (5\u00d776) + (1\u00d753) + (5\u00d721) = 141 + 300 + 380 + 53 + 105 = 979\n\nWhat I'm offering to Player 2:\n- 1 unit of item 1\n- 0 units of item 2\n- 0 units of item 3\n- 0 units of item 4\n- 2 units of item 5\n\nThe downside is this is still below my outside offer. Let me try one more adjustment:\n- Keep all of items 2 and 3 (my highest value items)\n- Keep the one unit of item 4\n- Keep all units of item 1\n- Give 7 units of item 5\n\nMy value from this proposal:\n(4\u00d747) + (4\u00d775) + (5\u00d776) + (1\u00d753) + (0\u00d721) = 188 + 300 + 380 + 53 + 0 = 921\n\nWhile this is below my outside offer, I should consider the discount factor. If I walk away now, I get 1058. But if I counteroffer and we reach a deal in round 2, the discount factor reduces my outside offer's value to 0.9\u00d71058 = 952.2.\n\nSo strategically, I should make an initial offer that gives me at least 952.2 in value if accepted, while leaving room to improve in future rounds.\n\nLet me adjust again:\n- Keep all of items 2, 3, and 4\n- Keep 3 units of item 1\n- Keep 3 units of item 5\n- Give 1 unit of item 1\n- Give 4 units of item 5\n\nMy value from this proposal:\n(3\u00d747) + (4\u00d775) + (5\u00d776) + (1\u00d753) + (3\u00d721) = 141 + 300 + 380 + 53 + 63 = 937\n\nThis is below 1058 but above the discounted value of 952.2. It's a strategic first offer.\n\n### Step 3: Make a decision\n\nI need to consider that this is round 1, so I shouldn't offer my best possible deal yet. Starting with a reasonable offer that gives me good value while leaving room to negotiate is the best approach.\n\nThe offer I just calculated gives me a value of 937, which is below my outside offer but above my discounted outside offer value for round 2. It also provides the other player with some items while keeping most of my high-value items.\n\nTherefore, I will make a counteroffer giving Player 2:\n- 1 unit of item 1\n- 0 units of item 2\n- 0 units of item 3\n- 0 units of item 4\n- 4 units of item 5\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 0, 4]}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 57. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 594 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 4, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party.

Item 4 (90 per unit)\n2. Item 1 (74 per unit)\n3. Item 2 (41 per unit)\n4. Item 5 (4 per unit)\n5. Item 3 (3 per unit)\n\n## 3) Decision Making:\nI'll craft an initial offer where I give Player 2 the items I value least, while keeping the most valuable ones:\n\nProposed offer (what Player 2 gets):\n- Item 1: 1 unit (I keep 4)\n- Item 2: 0 units (I keep 2)\n- Item 3: 4 units (I give all)\n- Item 4: 0 units (I keep 2)\n- Item 5: 2 units (I give all)\n\nValue calculation of what I keep:\n- 4 units of item 1: 4 \u00d7 74 = 296\n- 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 41 = 82\n- 0 units of item 3: 0 \u00d7 3 = 0\n- 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 90 = 180\n- 0 units of item 5: 0 \u00d7 4 = 0\nTotal value to me: 558\n\nThis is significantly higher than my outside offer of 8, so it's a good starting position.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1197. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 999 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 2, 3, 3, 9] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    65 x 2 + 50 x 2 + 100 x 3 + 66 x 3 + 52 x 9\n    which is 1196 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1197. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 0, 1, 0, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 0, 1, 0, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Let's analyze this situation step by step:\n\n### 1) Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **Outside Offer Value**: Your outside offer value is 1197.\n\n- **Values of the Items**:\n  - Item 1: 65\n  - Item 2: 50\n  - Item 3: 100\n  - Item 4: 66\n  - Item 5: 52\n\n- **Total Pool of Items**:\n  - 5 units of Item 1\n  - 2 units of Item 2\n  - 3 units of Item 3\n  - 4 units of Item 4\n  - 9 units of Item 5\n\n- **Discount Factor Influence**: The discount factor gamma = 0.9 influences the value of accepting the current offer vs. waiting for future offers. Since this is round 1 and gamma^0 = 1, the current offer's value is not discounted yet.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer**: [3, 0, 1, 0, 2]\n  - Total value if accepted:\n    - 3 units of Item 1 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195\n    - 0 units of Item 2 = 0 \u00d7 50 = 0\n    - 1 unit of Item 3 = 1 \u00d7 100 = 100\n    - 0 units of Item 4 = 0 \u00d7 66 = 0\n    - 2 units of Item 5 = 2 \u00d7 52 = 104\n    - Total value = 195 + 0 + 100 + 0 + 104 = 399\n\n- **Comparison**: The value of the current offer (399) is far less than your outside offer (1197).\n\n### 3) Make a Decision\n\n- **Considering Mistakes**:\n  - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse than your outside offer.\n  - Therefore, accepting the current offer is not advisable.\n\nSince the value of the current offer (399) is far less than my outside offer (1197), it is not acceptable. Instead, I should propose a counteroffer that is more beneficial to me.\n\n### Counteroffer Strategy\n\nTo avoid *Mistake 2* (offering worse than my outside offer), I need to propose a distribution that gives me at least a value of 1197. Here's a possible counteroffer:\n\nLet's propose the other player gets:\n- 0 units of Item 1\n- 0 units of Item 2\n- 0 units of Item 3\n- 0 units of Item 4\n- 3 units of Item 5\n\nThis means I would keep:\n- 5 units of Item 1 = 5 \u00d7 65 = 325\n- 2 units of Item 2 = 2 \u00d7 50 = 100\n- 3 units of Item 3 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300\n- 4 units of Item 4 = 4 \u00d7 66 = 264\n- 6 units of Item 5 = 6 \u00d7 52 = 312\n- Total self value = 325 + 100 + 300 + 264 + 312 = 1301\n\nThe total value (1301) is greater than my outside offer (1197). This counteroffer guarantees that I meet or exceed my fallback option.\n\n### Action\n\nI will make the following counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 3]}\n```",

                    "response": "Let's analyze the current situation step by step.\n\n### 1) Situation Analysis:\n- **Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer value is 1197.\n- **Values of Items**:\n  - Item 1: 65\n  - Item 2: 50\n  - Item 3: 100\n  - Item 4: 66\n  - Item 5: 52\n- **Total Pool of Items**: \n  - Item 1: 5\n  - Item 2: 2\n  - Item 3: 3\n  - Item 4: 4\n  - Item 5: 9\n- **Discount Factor**: If the negotiation concludes after the current round (round 2), the value of the agreed offer will be multiplied by \\( \\gamma^{(2-1)} = 0.9 \\).\n\n### 2) Assess Value of Offers:\n- **Current Offer**: [3, 0, 1, 0, 1]\n  - My value for this offer:\n    - Item 1: 3 \u00d7 65 = 195\n    - Item 3: 1 \u00d7 100 = 100\n    - Item 5: 1 \u00d7 52 = 52\n  - Total value = 195 + 100 + 52 = 347\n  - Discounted value = 347 \u00d7 0.9 = 312.3\n\n- **Comparison to Outside Offer**: \n  - The discounted total value from the current offer (312.3) is much less than my outside offer of 1197.\n\nSince the current offer's value is lower than my outside offer, I should not accept it. I need to propose a better counteroffer that brings my value as close to or greater than 1197.\n\n### 3) Counteroffer Calculation:\nTo calculate a better counteroffer, I'll aim for a value greater than my outside offer of 1197. Due to the discount factor, I should aim for at least a total value before discount that would result in a post-discount value greater than 1197.\n\nLet's propose a counteroffer that maximizes my high-value items: \n- I want to keep more of items with high value: Item 1, Item 3, and Item 4. \n\nPropose to give:\n- Item 1: 1 (Keep 4)\n- Item 2: 0 (Keep 2)\n- Item 3: 0 (Keep 3)\n- Item 4: 2 (Keep 2)\n- Item 5: 5 (Keep 4)\n\n**Proposed Counteroffer**: [1, 0, 0, 2, 5]\n\n**My value for this counteroffer**:\n- Item 1: 4 \u00d7 65 = 260\n- Item 2: 2 \u00d7 50 = 100\n- Item 3: 3 \u00d7 100 = 300\n- Item 4: 2 \u00d7 66 = 132\n- Item 5: 4 \u00d7 52 = 208\n\nTotal value = 260 + 100 + 300 + 132 + 208 = 1000\nDiscounted value (after round 2): 1000 \u00d7 0.9 = 900\n\nThis value is still less than my outside offer, so I need to adjust to keep more high-value items.\n\nAttempt another distribution:\n- Give player 1 an offer of: [2, 0, 0, 3, 3]\n\nRecalculate:\n- For this, I keep: [3, 2, 3, 1, 6]:\n  - Item 1: 3 \u00d7 65 = 195\n  - Item 2: 2 \u00d7 50 = 100\n  - Item 3: 3 \u00d7 100 = 300\n  - Item 4: 1 \u00d7 66 = 66\n  - Item 5: 6 \u00d7 52 = 312\n  \nTotal value = 195 + 100 + 300 + 66 + 312 = 973\nDiscounted estimated value: 973 \u00d7 0.9 = 875.7\n\nThis still doesn't meet my outside offer, needing to adjust towards getting items that surpass.\n\nFinally attempt something like:\n- Offer: [3, 0, 0, 4, 6]\n\nI keep [2, 2, 3, 0, 3] - calculation:\n  - Item 1: 2 \u00d7 65 = 130\n  - Item 2: 2 \u00d7 50 = 100\n  - Item 3: 3 \u00d7 100 = 300\n  - Item 5: 3 \u00d7 52 = 156\n\nValue = 130 + 100 + 300 + 156 = 686\nDiscounted: 686 \u00d7 0.9 = 617.4\n\nIt's obvious I can't match outside offer, more strategize about compromising.\n\nSince further negotiation won\u2019t beat the guarantee, I propose we WALK. Reach not probable.\n\n**Decision**:\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 1511. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1511. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1098 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 1, 3, 3, 7] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    66 x 5 + 56 x 1 + 57 x 3 + 89 x 3 + 98 x 7\n    which is 1510 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1511.

If the negotiation goes longer, the outcome's value will be discounted by \\( \\gamma^{r-1} \\).\n\n### Step 2: Assess Value of Offers\n- **Current Offer (To Accept Current Offer)**:\n  - 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 25 = 0\n  - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201\n  - 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 52 = 0\n  - 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 44 = 0\n  - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 20 = 0\n  - **Total Value** = 201\n  - When compared with my outside offer (770), the value of the current offer is significantly lower.\n\n- **Considering a Reasonable Counteroffer**:\n  - I should attempt to design a counteroffer where I receive items whose aggregate value exceeds my outside offer, or at least significantly improves my position from 201.\n  - Choosing to keep more high-value items for myself is ideal.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n- **Should I Accept the Current Offer?**: No, the total value of 201 is much lower than my outside offer of 770.\n- **Should I Walk Away?**: It's too early to take the \"walk\" action. Try to negotiate a better offer.\n- **Counteroffer Proposal**: Since a better strategy involves keeping more valuable items for myself:\n  - I propose keeping the entire share of either high-value items or an optimal mix of them.

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 1511. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1511. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1098 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 1, 3, 3, 7] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    66 x 5 + 56 x 1 + 57 x 3 + 89 x 3 + 98 x 7\n    which is 1510 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1511. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 3, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 1, 0, 1, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 1, 0, 1, 4]\n\n    What is your action?

They value item 3 highly (offered me none).\n\nLet me create a counteroffer that maximizes my value while being reasonable to Player 2:\n- I'll keep all high-value items 4 and 5 (my values 89 and 98)\n- I'll keep most of item 1 (my value 66)\n- I'll offer more of items 2 and 3 (my values 56 and 57)\n\nPotential counteroffer - I offer them [1, 3, 2, 0, 0], meaning I keep [4, 2, 1, 3, 7]:\n- 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 66 = 264\n- 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 56 = 112\n- 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 57 = 57\n- 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267\n- 7 units of item 5 = 7 \u00d7 98 = 686\nTotal I would keep = 1386\n\nWith discount factor: 1386 \u00d7 0.9 = 1247.4\n\nThis is less than my outside offer. Let me adjust.\n\nRevised counteroffer - I offer them [0, 3, 1, 0, 0], meaning I keep [5, 2, 2, 3, 7]:\n- 5 units of item 1 = 5 \u00d7 66 = 330\n- 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 56 = 112\n- 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 57 = 114\n- 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267\n- 7 units of item 5 = 7 \u00d7 98 = 686\nTotal I would keep = 1509\n\nWith discount factor: 1509 \u00d7 0.9 = 1358.1\n\nThis is still less than my outside offer.\n\nSince we're in round 2, and considering the discount factor, I need to make a final decision:\n\n1. My current best counteroffer value (1358.1) is less than my outside offer (1511)\n2. Walking away now guarantees me 1511\n3. If I make another counteroffer, we'd enter round 3 with an additional discount, making it even harder to exceed my outside offer\n\n## Decision\n\nThe rational choice is to walk away and take my outside offer of 1511, which is significantly better than any deal I can make given the current negotiation trajectory.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Let me recalculate.\n\nLet's try keeping more of the high-value items:\nProposed offer (to give to Player 2): [0, 0, 2, 4, 0]\n\nThis means I would keep:\n- Item 1: 7 units (7 \u00d7 91 = 637)\n- Item 2: 6 units (6 \u00d7 89 = 534)\n- Item 3: 1 unit (1 \u00d7 41 = 41)\n- Item 4: 1 unit (1 \u00d7 32 = 32)\n- Item 5: 4 units (4 \u00d7 85 = 340)\n\nTotal value for me: 637 + 534 + 41 + 32 + 340 = 1584\n\nThat's still below my outside offer. Let me adjust further.\n\nKeeping more high-value items:\nProposed offer (to give to Player 2): [0, 0, 2, 3, 0]\n\nThis means I would keep:\n- Item 1: 7 units (7 \u00d7 91 = 637)\n- Item 2: 6 units (6 \u00d7 89 = 534)\n- Item 3: 1 unit (1 \u00d7 41 = 41)\n- Item 4: 2 units (2 \u00d7 32 = 64)\n- Item 5: 4 units (4 \u00d7 85 = 340)\n\nTotal value for me: 637 + 534 + 41 + 64 + 340 = 1616\n\nStill below my outside offer. Let's adjust once more.\n\nKeeping almost everything of high value:\nProposed offer (to give to Player 2): [0, 0, 1, 3, 0]\n\nThis means I would keep:\n- Item 1: 7 units (7 \u00d7 91 = 637)\n- Item 2: 6 units (6 \u00d7 89 = 534)\n- Item 3: 2 units (2 \u00d7 41 = 82)\n- Item 4: 2 units (2 \u00d7 32 = 64)\n- Item 5: 4 units (4 \u00d7 85 = 340)\n\nTotal value for me: 637 + 534 + 82 + 64 + 340 = 1657\n\nStill below outside offer. Let's make one final adjustment.\n\nProposed offer (to give to Player 2): [0, 0, 0, 3, 0]\n\nThis means I would keep:\n- Item 1: 7 units (7 \u00d7 91 = 637)\n- Item 2: 6 units (6 \u00d7 89 = 534)\n- Item 3: 3 units (3 \u00d7 41 = 123)\n- Item 4: 2 units (2 \u00d7 32 = 64)\n- Item 5: 4 units (4 \u00d7 85 = 340)\n\nTotal value for me: 637 + 534 + 123 + 64 + 340 = 1698\n\nStill below my outside offer! Let's try one more time.\n\nProposed offer (to give to Player 2): [0, 0, 0, 2, 0]\n\nThis means I would keep:\n- Item 1: 7 units (7 \u00d7 91 = 637)\n- Item 2: 6 units (6 \u00d7 89 = 534)\n- Item 3: 3 units (3 \u00d7 41 = 123)\n- Item 4: 3 units (3 \u00d7 32 = 96)\n- Item 5: 4 units (4 \u00d7 85 = 340)\n\nTotal value for me: 637 + 534 + 123 + 96 + 340 = 1730\n\nThis is above my outside offer of 1710. However, this offer gives Player 2 very little (only 2 units of item 4), which might be rejected outright.\n\nLet me balance this a bit more while still ensuring my value exceeds my outside offer:\n\nProposed offer (to give to Player 2): [0, 0, 0, 3, 1]\n\nThis means I would keep:\n- Item 1: 7 units (7 \u00d7 91 = 637)\n- Item 2: 6 units (6 \u00d7 89 = 534)\n- Item 3: 3 units (3 \u00d7 41 = 123)\n- Item 4: 2 units (2 \u00d7 32 = 64)\n- Item 5: 3 units (3 \u00d7 85 = 255)\n\nTotal value for me: 637 + 534 + 123 + 64 + 255 = 1613\n\nThat's less than my outside offer again. Let me try once more.\n\nProposed offer (to give to Player 2): [0, 0, 0, 2, 1]\n\nThis means I would keep:\n- Item 1: 7 units (7 \u00d7 91 = 637)\n- Item 2: 6 units (6 \u00d7 89 = 534)\n- Item 3: 3 units (3 \u00d7 41 = 123)\n- Item 4: 3 units (3 \u00d7 32 = 96)\n- Item 5: 3 units (3 \u00d7 85 = 255)\n\nTotal value for me: 637 + 534 + 123 + 96 + 255 = 1645\n\nStill below my outside offer. I need to keep more high-value items.\n\n## Step 3: Make a decision\n\nBased on my analysis, I need to keep nearly all the high-value items to exceed my outside offer. I will propose an offer that gives Player 2 only the lowest-value items (from my perspective):\n\nProposed offer (to give to Player 2): [0, 0, 0, 2, 0]\n\nWith this offer, I keep:\n- Item 1: 7 units (7 \u00d7",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 10. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 861 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    76 x 0 + 66 x 0 + 41 x 0 + 67 x 0 + 37 x 0\n    which is 0 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 10. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 137. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 891 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 1, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    51 x 1 + 70 x 0 + 71 x 1 + 8 x 1 + 97 x 0\n    which is 130 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 137. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 710. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 710. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 900 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 1, 3, 0, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    73 x 2 + 48 x 1 + 53 x 3 + 37 x 0 + 89 x 4\n    which is 709 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 710. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 3, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 3, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To determine the most strategic action, let's analyze the current situation step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **My Outside Offer Value**: 710\n- **Values of Items**: \n  - Item 1: 73\n  - Item 2: 48\n  - Item 3: 53\n  - Item 4: 37\n  - Item 5: 89\n- **Total Pool of Items**: \n  - Item 1: 3 units\n  - Item 2: 4 units\n  - Item 3: 3 units\n  - Item 4: 5 units\n  - Item 5: 4 units\n- **Discount Factor**: The value I receive decreases by a factor of 0.9 per round. Therefore, the effective value of an acceptable deal in round 1 is not discounted.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n1. **Current Offer [0, 1, 3, 1, 0]**:\n   - Calculating my value for this offer:\n     - Item 1: 0 \u00d7 73 = 0\n     - Item 2: 1 \u00d7 48 = 48\n     - Item 3: 3 \u00d7 53 = 159\n     - Item 4: 1 \u00d7 37 = 37\n     - Item 5: 0 \u00d7 89 = 0\n   - Total value = 48 + 159 + 37 = 244\n\n2. **Comparing with Outside Offer**: \n   - Value of current offer (244) is significantly less than my outside offer (710).\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\n- Since the value of the current offer (244) is much less than my outside offer (710), it would be a mistake to accept it (Mistake 4).\n- Instead, I should propose a counteroffer that maximizes my value without slipping below the outside offer value.\n\n#### Developing a Counteroffer\n- The goal is to keep items that maximize my value while ensuring the counteroffer is greater than 710.\n- Let's propose offering Player 1 the following units [1, 3, 0, 3, 0], meaning I keep: \n  - Item 1: 2\n  - Item 2: 1\n  - Item 3: 3\n  - Item 4: 2\n  - Item 5: 4\n\n- **Calculating the value for me**:\n  - Item 1: 2 \u00d7 73 = 146\n  - Item 2: 1 \u00d7 48 = 48\n  - Item 3: 0 \u00d7 53 = 0\n  - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 37 = 74\n  - Item 5: 4 \u00d7 89 = 356\n  - Total value = 146 + 48 + 0 + 74 + 356 = 624\n\nUnfortunately, 624 is less than my outside offer of 710. Therefore, I need to adjust the allocation to improve value further. Let's attempt to optimize for a better allocation:\n\n### Adjusting for Higher Value:\nLet's try [0, 2, 2, 2, 1], meaning I keep:\n- Item 1: 3\n- Item 2: 2\n- Item 3: 1\n- Item 4: 3\n- Item 5: 3\n\n**Calculating the Value**:\n- Item 1: 3 \u00d7 73 = 219\n- Item 2: 2 \u00d7 48 = 96\n- Item 3: 1 \u00d7 53 = 53\n- Item 4: 3 \u00d7 37 = 111\n- Item 5: 3 \u00d7 89 = 267\n- Total value = 219 + 96 + 53 + 111 + 267 = 746\n\nThis offer yields a value of 746, which is greater than my outside offer of 710.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 710. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 900 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 1, 3, 0, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    73 x 2 + 48 x 1 + 53 x 3 + 37 x 0 + 89 x 4\n    which is 709 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 710. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 3, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 2, 2, 2, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 3, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 3, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Since this is the final round, I should be strategic. If I make a counteroffer, Player 2 can only accept, walk away, or be forced to walk (as stated in the rules for the final round). Therefore, I should propose something that maximizes my value while still being potentially acceptable to Player 2.\n\nBased on the negotiation history, I can infer:\n- Player 2 seems to value item 1 (they requested it in their last offer)\n- Player 2 doesn't seem to value items 4 and 5 much (they've consistently offered those to me)\n- Player 2 is willing to take item 3 (which is low value to me)\n\nI could propose a counteroffer like [1, 1, 3, 0, 0], keeping most of the high-value items for myself.\nIf I keep [2, 3, 0, 5, 4]:\n- 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 74 = 148\n- 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219\n- 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 8 = 0\n- 5 units of item 4 = 5 \u00d7 80 = 400\n- 4 units of item 5 = 4 \u00d7 87 = 348\n- Total value = 1115\n- With discount: 1115 \u00d7 0.81 = 903.15\n\n## Step 3: Make a decision\n\nComparing my options:\n1. Accept Player 2's offer: Value = 962.28\n2. Make a counteroffer: Value = 903.15 (plus risk of Player 2 walking)\n3. Walk away: Value = 367\n\nThe current offer from Player 2 gives me the highest value. If I make a counteroffer, there's a risk Player 2 will walk away, and my counteroffer actually gives me less value due to my concessions. Additionally, since this is the final round, any counteroffer I make will be less advantageous for me than accepting the current offer.\n\nTherefore, I should accept the current offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

Your value would be:\n    88 x 3 + 18 x 6 + 51 x 3 + 2 x 3 + 35 x 2\n    which is 601 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 606. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 103. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 699 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    76 x 0 + 8 x 0 + 26 x 0 + 89 x 0 + 34 x 3\n    which is 102 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 103. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values.

In this first round, the discount factor does not apply yet, as discounting begins from round 2.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n- **Current Offer Value if Accepted**:\n  - 0 units of Item 1: 0 \u00d7 76 = 0\n  - 2 units of Item 2: 2 \u00d7 8 = 16\n  - 0 units of Item 3: 0 \u00d7 26 = 0\n  - 3 units of Item 4: 3 \u00d7 89 = 267\n  - 0 units of Item 5: 0 \u00d7 34 = 0\n  - **Total Value**: 0 + 16 + 0 + 267 + 0 = 283\n\nSince 283 (current offer) > 103 (outside offer), accepting would be more beneficial than walking away.\n\n- **Potential Counteroffers**: Any counteroffer needs to provide me with at least 283 of value or improve upon it. I can also try to propose a division that gives me a bit more value without being unrealistic.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision:\n1. **Should I Accept the Current Offer?**\n   - Yes, as it provides a total value of 283, which far exceeds my outside offer of 103.\n\n2. **Should I Walk Away?**\n   - No, walking away will leave me with only my outside offer value of 103, which is much less than the value from the current offer.\n\n3. **Should I Propose a Counteroffer?**\n   - A counteroffer is only advisable if I can secure a significantly better deal without risking the completion of negotiations.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 690. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 558 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 3, 3, 4, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    84 x 5 + 24 x 3 + 37 x 3 + 2 x 4 + 39 x 2\n    which is 689 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 690. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 0, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 0, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Let's analyze the current situation step by step.\n\n1. **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n   - My outside offer value is 690. This is the value I am guaranteed to receive if I walk away from the negotiation.\n   - My private values for the items are 84 for item 1, 24 for item 2, 37 for item 3, 2 for item 4, and 39 for item 5.\n   - The total pool of items is 5 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor gamma = 0.9 influences the valuation of offers over rounds. If the negotiation extends to multiple rounds, the value of any agreement reached will be discounted accordingly.\n\n2. **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - *Current offer from Player 1:* [1, 2, 0, 2, 0]\n     - This means I would keep: \n       - 4 units of item 1\n       - 2 units of item 2\n       - 3 units of item 3\n       - 4 units of item 4\n       - 2 units of item 5\n     - Calculate my total value for this offer:\n       - 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 84 = 336\n       - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 24 = 48\n       - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111\n       - 4 units of item 4 = 4 \u00d7 2 = 8\n       - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 39 = 78\n     - Total value = 336 + 48 + 111 + 8 + 78 = 581\n\n   - *Comparison to my outside offer:*\n     - My value for this offer (581) is less than my outside offer (690). Accepting this would not be beneficial for me.\n\n3. **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   - I shouldn't accept the current offer as it is lower than my outside offer.\n   - Walking away is an option since my outside offer is higher.\n   - Since I can propose a counteroffer, I need to find a division that offers me more than 690.\n\n   A potential counteroffer could aim to maximize my value by keeping more units of the valuable items (item 1 and item 5).\n\n   Let's propose an initial counteroffer:\n\n   - Offer Player 1: [1, 0, 0, 2, 0] (I keep most of item 1 and all of item 5 for their high values to me).\n\n   Calculating my value for the proposed counteroffer:\n   - I keep: \n     - 4 units of item 1 = 336\n     - 4 units of item 2 = 96\n     - 3 units of item 3 = 111\n     - 4 units of item 4 = 8\n     - 2 units of item 5 = 78\n   - Total value = 336 + 96 + 111 + 8 + 78 = 629\n\n   The value of 629 is still less than my outside offer of 690, so I need to adjust to keep more of item 1.\n\n   Let's revise the counteroffer:\n   - Offer Player 1: [0, 0, 0, 5, 0] \n\n   Calculating my value for the proposed counteroffer:\n\n   - I keep: \n     - 5 units of item 1 = 420\n     - 4 units of item 2 = 96\n     - 3 units of item 3 = 111\n     - 1 unit of item 4 = 2\n     - 2 units of item 5 = 78\n     \n   - Total value = 420 + 96 + 111 + 2 + 78 = 707\n   \nThis proposed counteroffer is better than my outside offer of 690.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 0, 4, 0, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    5 x 4 + 68 x 0 + 35 x 4 + 9 x 0 + 61 x 5\n    which is 465 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 466. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

Since there are no units of Item 2, I'll focus on keeping most of Items 3 and 5.\n\nLet me test a potential offer where I keep most of the high-value items:\n- I keep: [1,0,3,1,4] (giving [4,0,1,1,1] to Player 2)\n- Value to me: 1\u00d75 + 0\u00d768 + 3\u00d735 + 1\u00d79 + 4\u00d761 = 5 + 0 + 105 + 9 + 244 = 363\n\nThat's less than my outside offer.

Let's try again:\n\n- I keep: [2,0,4,1,5] (giving [3,0,0,1,0] to Player 2)\n- Value to me: 2\u00d75 + 0\u00d768 + 4\u00d735 + 1\u00d79 + 5\u00d761 = 10 + 0 + 140 + 9 + 305 = 464\n\nThat's still slightly below my outside offer. One more adjustment:\n\n- I keep: [2,0,4,2,5] (giving [3,0,0,0,0] to Player 2)\n- Value to me: 2\u00d75 + 0\u00d768 + 4\u00d735 + 2\u00d79 + 5\u00d761 = 10 + 0 + 140 + 18 + 305 = 473\n\nThis is above my outside offer (466) by a small margin.\n\nOne more option:\n- I keep: [3,0,4,2,5] (giving [2,0,0,0,0] to Player 2)\n- Value to me: 3\u00d75 + 0\u00d768 + 4\u00d735 + 2\u00d79 + 5\u00d761 = 15 + 0 + 140 + 18 + 305 = 478\n\nEven better, but this might be too aggressive.\n\nLet me check a more balanced offer:\n- I keep: [1,0,4,2,5] (giving [4,0,0,0,0] to Player 2)\n- Value to me: 1\u00d75 + 0\u00d768 + 4\u00d735 + 2\u00d79 + 5\u00d761 = 5 + 0 + 140 + 18 + 305 = 468\n\nThis is slightly above my outside offer and gives Player 2 something of potential value.\n\n### 4) Decision\n\nI'll offer Player 2 [4,0,0,0,0], meaning I keep [1,0,4,2,5].\nThis gives me a value of 468, which is greater than my outside offer of 466.\nSince Item 1 has low value to me (5 per unit), offering 4 units to Player 2 is reasonable while keeping the items I value more.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4,0,0,0,0]}",

If I keep trying along this path, I need to improve further.\n\nFinally:\nConsidering this, I suspect there remains no further high yielding option thus:\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"} - indicates my final decision to not go below my outside offer, ensuring the optimal guaranteed value.",

For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 2, 9, 7] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    14 x 0 + 65 x 1 + 45 x 2 + 62 x 9 + 93 x 7\n    which is 1364 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1366. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Keep most of my highest-valued items (especially item 1)\n2. Offer more of my lowest-valued items (especially item 3)\n3.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 10. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 870 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    32 x 0 + 87 x 0 + 68 x 0 + 77 x 0 + 26 x 0\n    which is 0 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 10. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 5, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 5, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 3, 4, 1, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    85 x 1 + 5 x 3 + 18 x 4 + 26 x 1 + 62 x 2\n    which is 322 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 323. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Therefore, I should consider either walking away or making a counteroffer better aligned with my outside offer.\n\nLet's propose a counteroffer where I maximize my value to ensure it is greater than 799.\n\n#### Proposed Counteroffer\n\nTo exceed 799, I'll try to keep a larger share of the more valuable items.\n\nIf I keep:\n- 5 units of Item 1 (5 x 56 = 280)\n- 1 unit of Item 2 (1 x 43 = 43)\n- 4 units of Item 3 (4 x 54 = 216)\n- 3 units of Item 4 (3 x 3 = 9)\n- 0 units of Item 5 (0 x 42 = 0)\n\nTotal value = 280 + 43 + 216 + 9 + 0 = 548\n\nThis total is still less than the outside offer, so I need to adjust my counteroffer.\n\nConsidering a more balanced offer:\n\nIf I keep:\n- 4 units of Item 1 (4 x 56 = 224)\n- 1 unit of Item 2 (1 x 43 = 43)\n- 3 units of Item 3 (3 x 54 = 162)\n- 5 units of Item 4 (5 x 3 = 15)\n- 2 units of Item 5 (2 x 42 = 84)\n\nTotal value = 224 + 43 + 162 + 15 + 84 = 528\n\nThis is still unacceptable, let's adjust again.\n\nKeep:\n- 5 units of Item 1 (5 x 56 = 280)\n- 0 units of Item 2 (0 x 43 = 0)\n- 3 units of Item 3 (3 x 54 = 162)\n- 4 units of Item 4 (4 x 3 = 12)\n- 2 units of Item 5 (2 x 42 = 84)\n\nTotal value = 280 + 0 + 162 + 12 + 84 = 538\n\nThis is improved, but still not 799.\n\nLet's go for another attempt.\n\nKeep:\n- 6 units of Item 1 (6 x 56 = 336)\n- 0 units of Item 2 (0 x 43 = 0)\n- 3 units of Item 3 (3 x 54 = 162)\n- 4 units of Item 4 (4 x 3 = 12)\n- 2 units of Item 5 (2 x 42 = 84)\n\nTotal value = 336 + 0 + 162 + 12 + 84 = 594\n\nOne final attempt to meet or exceed the outside offer.\n\nKeep:\n- 7 units of Item 1 (7 x 56 = 392)\n- 4 units of Item 2 (1 x 43 = 43)\n- 0 units of Item 3 (3 x 54 = 0)\n- 0 units of Item 4 (3 x 3 = 0)\n- 4 units of Item 5 (0 x 42 = 84)\n\nTotal value = 392 + 43 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 435 (Incorrect here)\n\nI need to define a sustainable offer better than my Outside Offer. Let's try again:\n\nKeep:\n- 7 units of Item 1 (7 x 56 = 392)\n- 0 units of Items 2\n- 4 units of Item 3 (4 x 54 = 216)\n- 1 units of Item 4 (1 x 3 = 3)\n- 1 units of Item 5 (1 x 42 = 42)\n\nTotal value to me = 392 + 216 + 3 + 42 = 653, still less, recalculating.\n\nNow, the counteroffer is [0, 4, 1, 5, 2] (giving away)\n\nMy value: \n- Item 1: 392\n- 2 units of Item 2 (2 x 43 = 86)\n- 3 units of Item 3 (3 x 54 = 162)\n- 0 unit of Item 4 (0 x 3 = 0)\n- 0 units of Item 5 (0 x 42 = 0)\n\nTotal = 392 + 216 = Still less.\n\nFinal attempt: Keeping 7,0,0,5,0\n\nNow value totals:\n- Item 1: 7 units = 7 x 56 = 392\n- Item 4: 5 units = 5 x 3 = 15\n\nTotal value = 392+ 15 = 407\n\nPlayer 1 receives value > 518 I must refrain from overextending why i'm incorrect in value extension offer. Walking away.\n\n**The current action is not to commit mistakes. Walking away based on the prior attempts at modeling.

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 625. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 625. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 435 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 7, 7, 3, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    20 x 2 + 45 x 7 + 10 x 7 + 58 x 3 + 12 x 2\n    which is 623 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 625. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

I need to make an initial offer that:\n- Keeps my value above my outside offer (625)\n- Ideally maximizes my gain while still being acceptable to Player 2\n\nLet me start by prioritizing items based on their value to me:\n1. Item 4: 58 per unit (highest value)\n2. Item 2: 45 per unit\n3. Item 1: 20 per unit\n4. Item 5: 12 per unit\n5. Item 3: 10 per unit (lowest value)\n\nI should keep most of my high-value items (4 and 2) and offer more of my low-value items (3 and 5).\n\nLet me calculate a potential offer where I keep most high-value items:\n- If I keep: [3, 6, 2, 3, 1] and offer [1, 1, 6, 0, 3]\n- My value: (3\u00d720) + (6\u00d745) + (2\u00d710) + (3\u00d758) + (1\u00d712) = 60 + 270 + 20 + 174 + 12 = 536\n\nThis is lower than my outside offer (625). Let me adjust.\n\n- If I keep: [4, 6, 5, 3, 2] and offer [0, 1, 3, 0, 2]\n- My value: (4\u00d720) + (6\u00d745) + (5\u00d710) + (3\u00d758) + (2\u00d712) = 80 + 270 + 50 + 174 + 24 = 598\n\nStill below my outside offer. One more adjustment:\n\n- If I keep: [4, 7, 3, 3, 2] and offer [0, 0, 5, 0, 2]\n- My value: (4\u00d720) + (7\u00d745) + (3\u00d710) + (3\u00d758) + (2\u00d712) = 80 + 315 + 30 + 174 + 24 = 623\n\nStill slightly below my outside offer. Final adjustment:\n\n- If I keep: [4, 7, 4, 3, 2] and offer [0, 0, 4, 0, 2]\n- My value: (4\u00d720) + (7\u00d745) + (4\u00d710) + (3\u00d758) + (2\u00d712) = 80 + 315 + 40 + 174 + 24 = 633\n\nThis is above my outside offer of 625, so it's acceptable.\n\n## 3) Decision Making:\n\nThe offer of [0, 0, 4, 0, 2] to Player 2:\n- Keeps my most valuable items (all of items 1, 2, and 4)\n- Gives away half of my lowest-value item (item 3)\n- Gives away half of item 5 which has relatively low value to me\n- Provides me with a total value of 633 which exceeds my outside offer of 625\n\nThis is a strategic opening offer that maintains most of my value while potentially leaving room for future negotiation if needed.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 4, 0, 2]}",

This suggests Player 2 values items 2 and 4 highly but doesn't value items 1, 3, and 5 as much.\n\n### My previous offer [0, 0, 4, 0, 2]:\nI offered them none of items 1, 2, and 4, half of item 3, and half of item 5. This seemed too generous from my side.\n\n### Potential counteroffer:\nI should keep most of the high-value items (2 and 4), and perhaps offer more of the items that seem less valuable to me (1, 3, 5).\n\nLet me try a counteroffer where I keep:\n- 2 units of item 1 (offering 2)\n- 7 units of item 2 (offering 0)\n- 4 units of item 3 (offering 4)\n- 3 units of item 4 (offering 0)\n- 2 units of item 5 (offering 2)\n\nValue calculation for what I keep:\n- 2 \u00d7 20 = 40\n- 7 \u00d7 45 = 315\n- 4 \u00d7 10 = 40\n- 3 \u00d7 58 = 174\n- 2 \u00d7 12 = 24\n\nTotal: 40 + 315 + 40 + 174 + 24 = 593\n\nWith discount factor: 593 \u00d7 0.9 = 533.7\n\nThis is below my outside offer of 625, so I need to adjust.\n\nLet me try another counteroffer where I keep:\n- 3 units of item 1 (offering 1)\n- 7 units of item 2 (offering 0)\n- 4 units of item 3 (offering 4)\n- 3 units of item 4 (offering 0)\n- 2 units of item 5 (offering 2)\n\nValue calculation for what I keep:\n- 3 \u00d7 20 = 60\n- 7 \u00d7 45 = 315\n- 4 \u00d7 10 = 40\n- 3 \u00d7 58 = 174\n- 2 \u00d7 12 = 24\n\nTotal: 60 + 315 + 40 + 174 + 24 = 613\n\nWith discount factor: 613 \u00d7 0.9 = 551.7\n\nStill below my outside offer. Let me adjust once more:\n\nLet me try another counteroffer where I keep:\n- 3 units of item 1 (offering 1)\n- 7 units of item 2 (offering 0)\n- 5 units of item 3 (offering 3)\n- 3 units of item 4 (offering 0)\n- 3 units of item 5 (offering 1)\n\nValue calculation for what I keep:\n- 3 \u00d7 20 = 60\n- 7 \u00d7 45 = 315\n- 5 \u00d7 10 = 50\n- 3 \u00d7 58 = 174\n- 3 \u00d7 12 = 36\n\nTotal: 60 + 315 + 50 + 174 + 36 = 635\n\nWith discount factor: 635 \u00d7 0.9 = 571.5\n\nThis is still below my outside offer of 625.\n\nGiven the discount factor and current round, I would need to keep even more to exceed my outside offer value. Let me make a final attempt:\n\nLet me try where I keep:\n- 4 units of item 1 (offering 0)\n- 7 units of item 2 (offering 0)\n- 5 units of item 3 (offering 3)\n- 3 units of item 4 (offering 0)\n- 3 units of item 5 (offering 1)\n\nValue calculation:\n- 4 \u00d7 20 = 80\n- 7 \u00d7 45 = 315\n- 5 \u00d7 10 = 50\n- 3 \u00d7 58 = 174\n- 3 \u00d7 12 = 36\n\nTotal: 80 + 315 + 50 + 174 + 36 = 655\n\nWith discount factor: 655 \u00d7 0.9 = 589.5\n\nThis is still less than my outside offer of 625.\n\n## 3) Decision:\n\nAfter careful analysis, it appears that with the current discount factor, neither accepting the offer nor making a reasonable counteroffer will exceed the value of my outside offer. Even keeping most items except perhaps 3 or 4 units of item 3 and 1 unit of item 5 doesn't yield a value higher than my outside offer after applying the discount.\n\nGiven this situation, the rational choice is to walk away and take my outside offer of 625.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 802. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 802. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 894 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 3, 1, 5, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    1 x 1 + 90 x 3 + 64 x 1 + 60 x 5 + 83 x 2\n    which is 801 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 802. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 802. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 894 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 3, 1, 5, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    1 x 1 + 90 x 3 + 64 x 1 + 60 x 5 + 83 x 2\n    which is 801 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 802. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values.

Gives me high value items (2, 3, 5)\n2. Gives Player 2 items they seem to value (especially item 1)\n3. Ensures my total value is above my outside offer of 802\n\nPotential counteroffer (what I give to Player 2):\n- 5 units of item 1 (I give all, I value these at only 5 total)\n- 1 unit of item 2 (I keep 3, value 270 to me)\n- 0 units of item 3 (I keep 1, value 64 to me)\n- 2 units of item 4 (I keep 3, value 180 to me)\n- 0 units of item 5 (I keep 3, value 249 to me)\n\nValue I keep: 5 + 270 + 64 + 180 + 249 = 768\nWith discount: 768 \u00d7 0.9 = 691.2\n\nThis is below my outside offer. Let me adjust:\n\nRevised counteroffer (what I give to Player 2):\n- 5 units of item 1 (I give all, value 5 to me)\n- 0 units of item 2 (I keep all 4, value 360 to me)\n- 0 units of item 3 (I keep 1, value 64 to me)\n- 2 units of item 4 (I keep 3, value 180 to me)\n- 0 units of item 5 (I keep all, value 249 to me)\n\nValue I keep: 0 + 360 + 64 + 180 + 249 = 853\nWith discount: 853 \u00d7 0.9 = 767.7\n\nThis is still below my outside offer of 802. Let me try one more adjustment:\n\nFinal counteroffer (what I give to Player 2):\n- 5 units of item 1 (I give all, value 5 to me)\n- 0 units of item 2 (I keep all 4, value 360 to me)\n- 0 units of item 3 (I keep 1, value 64 to me)\n- 1 unit of item 4 (I keep 4, value 240 to me)\n- 0 units of item 5 (I keep all 3, value 249 to me)\n\nValue I keep: 0 + 360 + 64 + 240 + 249 = 913\nWith discount: 913 \u00d7 0.9 = 821.7\n\nThis is above my outside offer value of 802. This offer gives Player 2 all of item 1 (which they seem to value) and 1 unit of item 4, while I keep the items I value most.\n\n## Step 4: Decision\n\nSince we're in round 2, and I have an offer that yields me 821.7 (discounted), which is greater than my outside offer of 802, I will make this counteroffer. This gives me the possibility of achieving a better outcome than my outside offer while still potentially being attractive to Player 2 based on their revealed preferences.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [5, 0, 0, 1, 0]}",

Therefore, I should not accept it (Mistake 4 and Mistake 5).\n   - Walking away would result in an automatic value of 195 due to my outside offer.\n   - Consider proposing a specific counteroffer:\n     - Earlier, I offered [1, 3, 0, 3, 0], and Player 1 did not accept.\n     - I should aim for a division where I gain more value than 195.\n     - One potential counteroffer could be [5, 2, 1, 0, 0]; I'll calculate its value:\n       - 0 units of item 1: 0 \u00d7 21 = 0\n       - 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 30 = 60\n       - 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 42 = 42\n       - 0 unit of item 4: 0 \u00d7 35 = 0\n       - 0 units of item 5: 0 \u00d7 56 = 0\n     - Total value = 0 + 60 + 42 + 0 + 0 = 102, which is worse than the next best settlement of 195.\n\nHence, I should not provide a worse counteroffer but ensure the proposal leads to a better profit by making a feasible offer above 195.\n\n- After considering various implications and computations, I will walk away.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 628. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 628. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 645 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 1, 4, 1, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    71 x 2 + 22 x 1 + 15 x 4 + 9 x 1 + 98 x 4\n    which is 625 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 628. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

                    "response": "I need to analyze the situation and make a strategic opening offer that maximizes my value while being acceptable to Player 2.\n\n## Step 1: Analyze my situation\n\n- My outside offer value: 125\n- My item values:\n  - Item 1: 82 per unit (3 units available)\n  - Item 2: 69 per unit (3 units available) \n  - Item 3: 92 per unit (4 units available)\n  - Item 4: 16 per unit (1 unit available)\n  - Item 5: 90 per unit (5 units available)\n- Total pool: 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 5 units of item 5\n- This is round 1, so discount factor doesn't apply yet (\u03b3^(1-1) = 1)\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the maximum value I could get\n\nIf I kept all items:\n- Item 1: 3 \u00d7 82 = 246\n- Item 2: 3 \u00d7 69 = 207\n- Item 3: 4 \u00d7 92 = 368\n- Item 4: 1 \u00d7 16 = 16\n- Item 5: 5 \u00d7 90 = 450\n- Total maximum value: 1287\n\nMy outside offer (125) is much less than this maximum value (1287), so I definitely prefer to negotiate rather than immediately walk away.\n\n## Step 3: Design a strategic opening offer\n\nI should prioritize keeping high-value items for myself. Based on my values:\n- Item 3 (92 per unit) and Item 5 (90 per unit) are most valuable\n- Item 1 (82 per unit) is also quite valuable\n- Item 2 (69 per unit) is medium value\n- Item 4 (16 per unit) is low value\n\nFor my opening offer, I'll offer Player 2 some lower-value items to me, keeping most high-value items. This gives them something while maximizing my value:\n\nLet me try offering:\n- 1 unit of item 1 (keeping 2)\n- 2 units of item 2 (keeping 1)\n- 1 unit of item 3 (keeping 3)\n- 1 unit of item 4 (keeping 0)\n- 1 unit of item 5 (keeping 4)\n\nSo my offer to Player 2 would be [1, 2, 1, 1, 1]\n\nValue I'd keep:\n- Item 1: 2 \u00d7 82 = 164\n- Item 2: 1 \u00d7 69 = 69\n- Item 3: 3 \u00d7 92 = 276\n- Item 4: 0 \u00d7 16 = 0\n- Item 5: 4 \u00d7 90 = 360\n- Total value for me: 869\n\nThis is significantly higher than my outside offer of 125, so this is a good starting offer. It also gives Player 2 some items from each category, so they have a foundation to negotiate from.\n\nTherefore, my action is to make a counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 1, 1, 1]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 679. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1014 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 2, 0, 1, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    87 x 1 + 96 x 2 + 40 x 0 + 44 x 1 + 71 x 5\n    which is 678 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 679. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Let's work through this step by step.\n\n## 1) Analyzing the Current Situation\n\n- My outside offer value: 125\n- My private values: item 1 = 82, item 2 = 69, item 3 = 92, item 4 = 16, item 5 = 90\n- Total pool of items: 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 5 units of item 5\n- Discount factor: \u03b3 = 0.9 (meaning values in round 2 are worth 0.9 of original value)\n\n## 2) Assessing the Value of Offers\n\n### Current offer from Player 2:\nIf I accept Player 2's offer of [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (meaning I get these quantities):\n- Value = (1\u00d782) + (1\u00d769) + (1\u00d792) + (1\u00d716) + (1\u00d790) = 349\n- With discount factor in round 2: 349 \u00d7 0.9 = 314.1\n- This is greater than my outside offer of 125\n\n### My previous offer:\nI offered [1, 2, 1, 1, 1] to Player 2, meaning I would keep [2, 1, 3, 0, 4]:\n- Value = (2\u00d782) + (1\u00d769) + (3\u00d792) + (0\u00d716) + (4\u00d790) = 164 + 69 + 276 + 0 + 360 = 869\n- With discount factor: 869 \u00d7 0.9 = 782.1\n- This is much greater than my outside offer of 125\n\n### Potential counteroffer:\nI should try to get a better deal than Player 2's current offer, but I should be careful not to ask for too much since we're already in round 2 and the discount factor is affecting values.\n\nLet me try a counteroffer of [1, 1, 1, 1, 2], meaning I keep [2, 2, 3, 0, 3]:\n- Value = (2\u00d782) + (2\u00d769) + (3\u00d792) + (0\u00d716) + (3\u00d790) = 164 + 138 + 276 + 0 + 270 = 848\n- With discount factor: 848 \u00d7 0.9 = 763.2\n- This is greater than my outside offer of 125 and better than accepting Player 2's current offer\n\n## 3) Making a Decision\n\nPlayer 2 reduced my initial offer, asking for the same amount of each item (1 unit). This suggests they may value these items somewhat equally. However, I value items 1, 3, and 5 most highly.\n\nSince Player 2's offer gives me a value of 314.1 (after discount), which is well above my outside offer of 125, I shouldn't walk away. However, I can try to improve my position with a reasonable counteroffer.\n\nMy counteroffer of [1, 1, 1, 1, 2] gives me more of my high-value items while being a slight compromise from my initial offer. This seems like a good balance between maximizing my value and increasing the chance of reaching an agreement.\n\nI will make a counteroffer of [1, 1, 1, 1, 2], which means I would keep [2, 2, 3, 0, 3].\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 2]}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 679. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1014 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 2, 0, 1, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    87 x 1 + 96 x 2 + 40 x 0 + 44 x 1 + 71 x 5\n    which is 678 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 679. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action?
