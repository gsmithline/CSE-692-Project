Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 220. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 220. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 675 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 4, 0, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    39 x 2 + 21 x 4 + 38 x 0 + 57 x 1 + 70 x 0\n    which is 219 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 220. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 1156. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1156. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 729 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 3, 0, 3, 8] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    26 x 2 + 78 x 3 + 11 x 0 + 31 x 3 + 97 x 8\n    which is 1155 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1156. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 1, 1, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 2, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 2, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

Clearly, the current offer is much worse than my outside offer.\n\n4) **Consider Counteroffer:**\n\nI need to calculate a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 1156, taking into account the discount factor.\nSince it is round 2, any accepted counteroffer would be discounted by 0.9.\nSo, any counteroffer must give me at least 1156 / 0.9 = 1284.4 value.\n\nLet's analyze my current counteroffer from Round 1: offering [1, 0, 1, 1, 0] to player 1. This means I keep:\n* Item 1: 3 units\n* Item 2: 4 units\n* Item 3: 2 units\n* Item 4: 3 units\n* Item 5: 8 units\n\nMy value for this division would be:\n(3 * 26) + (4 * 78) + (2 * 11) + (3 * 31) + (8 * 97) = 78 + 312 + 22 + 93 + 776 = 1281\n\nDiscounted value = 1281 * 0.9 = 1152.9, which is less than my outside offer of 1156.\n\nI need to aim for a value of at least 1285 for the items I keep.\n\nLet's try to offer [0,0,0,0,0] and keep everything\n\nMy value would be: (4 * 26) + (4 * 78) + (3 * 11) + (4 * 31) + (8 * 97) = 104 + 312 + 33 + 124 + 776 = 1349\nDiscounted value = 1349 * 0.9 = 1214.1. This still gives player 1 nothing.\n\nLet's try offering [0, 1, 0, 0, 0].

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1156. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 729 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 3, 0, 3, 8] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    26 x 2 + 78 x 3 + 11 x 0 + 31 x 3 + 97 x 8\n    which is 1155 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1156. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 1, 1, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 2, 2]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]\nRound 3: Player 1 offered [3, 0, 2, 2, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 0, 2, 2, 4]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action for Player 2 in round 3.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** 1156\n*   **Item values:** Item 1: 26, Item 2: 78, Item 3: 11, Item 4: 31, Item 5: 97\n*   **Total pool of items:** Item 1: 4, Item 2: 4, Item 3: 3, Item 4: 4, Item 5: 8\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since this is round 3, the discount factor will be 0.9^(3-1) = 0.9^2 = 0.81\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [3, 0, 2, 2, 4]. This means I would receive:\n    *   3 units of item 1 * 26 = 78\n    *   0 units of item 2 * 78 = 0\n    *   2 units of item 3 * 11 = 22\n    *   2 units of item 4 * 31 = 62\n    *   4 units of item 5 * 97 = 388\n    *   Total value = 78 + 0 + 22 + 62 + 388 = 550\n    *   Discounted Value = 550 * 0.81 = 445.5\n\n*   **Comparing to outside offer:** The discounted value of accepting the current offer (445.5) is significantly lower than my outside offer (1156). Therefore, accepting the current offer would be a mistake.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**  Since this is the final round, a counteroffer is equivalent to a WALK. Therefore, I only need to compare the current offer to my outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is worth 445.5 to me, which is much less than my outside offer of 1156.\n*   Making a counteroffer is equivalent to walking away.\n\nTherefore, the optimal action is to walk away and take my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

This means I receive:\n*   Item 1: 1 unit (Player 1 gets 3-1 = 2)\n*   Item 2: 2 units (Player 1 gets 4-2 = 2)\n*   Item 3: 2 units (Player 1 gets 4-2 = 2)\n*   Item 4: 0 units (Player 1 gets 1-0 = 1)\n*   Item 5: 3 units (Player 1 gets 4-3 = 1)\n\nMy total value if I accept:\n1 * 69 + 2 * 69 + 2 * 60 + 0 * 66 + 3 * 13 = 69 + 138 + 120 + 0 + 39 = 366\n\n3) **Compare to Outside Offer and Consider Counteroffers:**\n\n*   The current offer (366) is less than my outside offer (551).\n*   Therefore, I should not accept the current offer. I need to make a counteroffer that provides me with a value greater than 551.\n\nLet's try to find a better counteroffer. I will start by calculating the total value of all the items I possess.\n\n*   3 units of item 1: 3 * 69 = 207\n*   4 units of item 2: 4 * 69 = 276\n*   4 units of item 3: 4 * 60 = 240\n*   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 66 = 66\n*   4 units of item 5: 4 * 13 = 52\n*   Total: 207 + 276 + 240 + 66 + 52 = 841\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I offer player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\n*   Item 1: 3 units (value 207)\n*   Item 2: 4 units (value 276)\n*   Item 3: 4 units (value 240)\n*   Item 4: 1 unit (value 66)\n*   Item 5: 4 units (value 52)\n*   Total: 841\n\nThis is greater than my outside offer. However, offering nothing to Player 1 might be seen as greedy, which leads to WALKING and a payoff of 551 * 0.9 = 495.9 in round 2.\n\nLet's try to find a fairer counteroffer. I want to find an offer that gives me a value of at least 551.\n\nI am currently getting 366 from the current offer. 841 - 366 = 475 is the value player 1 is getting, roughly half.\n\nIf I give Player 1 everything except Item 2 and Item 3, so give Player 1 the offer of [3, 0, 0, 1, 4], I get:\n4 * 69 + 4 * 60 = 276 + 240 = 516, which is not enough, since my outside offer is 551.\n\nIf I give Player 1 the offer of [2, 1, 1, 1, 4], I get:\nItem 1: 1 unit (value 69)\nItem 2: 3 units (value 207)\nItem 3: 3 units (value 180)\nItem 4: 0 units (value 0)\nItem 5: 0 units (value 0)\nTotal: 69 + 207 + 180 = 456, which is less than my outside offer, thus I cannot accept.\n\nTo prevent mistake 2, making an offer worse than my outside offer, I will try to calculate the minimum amount of each item I must keep to be greater than 551.\n\nLet's keep all the items except item 5.\nOffer [3, 4, 4, 1, 0].\nTotal value: 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 4 * 13 = 52, which is less than 551.\n\nLet's keep the following items: [2, 3, 3, 1, 4], offer [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]\nValue = 2 * 69 + 3 * 69 + 3 * 60 + 1 * 66 + 4 * 13 = 138 + 207 + 180 + 66 + 52 = 643.\nThis is better than 551. I will propose this offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 4, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    23 x 0 + 68 x 0 + 15 x 4 + 73 x 1 + 3 x 1\n    which is 136 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 137. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 137. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 546 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 4, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    23 x 0 + 68 x 0 + 15 x 4 + 73 x 1 + 3 x 1\n    which is 136 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 137. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 2, 0, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 2, 0, 3]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Thus, it is typically advantageous to reach a resolution sooner rather than later.\n\n2) **Assessing the Value of Offers:**\n   - Since there is no current offer from Player 2, I need to consider potential counteroffers I could make.\n   - **Counteroffer Evaluation:**\n     - For example, if we propose a split where we take the entirety of item 2 and item 5 (both higher-value items for us compared to others), and allocate the rest of the items favorably to balance:\n       - 4 units of item 1: 0 units to us \n       - 3 units of item 2: 3 units to us, 0 to Player 2\n       - 4 units of item 3: 0 units to us\n       - 2 units of item 4: 0 units to us\n       - 1 unit of item 5: 1 unit to us, 0 to Player 2\n\n     - **Calculate Our Value:**\n       - 0 x 34 (Item 1) = 0\n       - 3 x 93 (Item 2) = 279\n       - 0 x 63 (Item 3) = 0 \n       - 0 x 24 (Item 4) = 0\n       - 1 x 72 (Item 5) = 72\n       - **Total:** 351\n\n     - We should propose this counteroffer as it significantly exceeds our outside offer value of 50.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n   - Since we don't have an existing offer from Player 2, we should propose a counteroffer that maximizes our value.

I want to keep more of item 2 and item 3, and maybe some of item 4, since those have the highest values for me.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1241. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1053 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 7, 4, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    66 x 0 + 54 x 0 + 80 x 7 + 77 x 4 + 74 x 5\n    which is 1238 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1241. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1241. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1053 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 7, 4, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    66 x 0 + 54 x 0 + 80 x 7 + 77 x 4 + 74 x 5\n    which is 1238 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1241. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 3, 0, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 5, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 5, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To determine my best course of action, let's analyze the situation:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 1241.\n   - My item values (per unit) are: \n     - Item 1: 66\n     - Item 2: 54\n     - Item 3: 80\n     - Item 4: 77\n     - Item 5: 74\n   - The total pool of items is: 3 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 8 of item 3, 4 of item 4, 7 of item 5.\n   - The discount factor decreases the value of future rounds' agreements. In round 2, the value would be multiplied by gamma^1 = 0.9, making immediate agreements more valuable.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer [1, 1, 5, 1, 1] (offered to me):**\n     - Value to me = (1 * 66) + (1 * 54) + (5 * 80) + (1 * 77) + (1 * 74) = 66 + 54 + 400 + 77 + 74 = 671\n     - Adjusted for round 2: 671 * 0.9 = 603.9\n\n   - **Value comparison**:\n     - The current offer's value of 603.9 is significantly less than my outside offer of 1241.\n\n   - **Potential counteroffer assessment:**\n     - I need to propose an offer where my retained items are worth more than 1241 after adjustment for the round's discount.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\n   Since the current offer is considerably worse than my outside offer, I should not accept it according to Mistake 4. Instead, formulating a counteroffer is the more appropriate strategy. I need to retain enough value for my items to exceed my outside offer of 1241 once discounted to round 2 values.\n\n   An offer that leaves me with this value would look like:\n\n   - Offer Player 2: [1, 0, 3, 0, 3]\n   - My keeping: [2, 1, 5, 4, 4]\n   - Value to me = (2 * 66) + (1 * 54) + (5 * 80) + (4 * 77) + (4 * 74) = 132 + 54 + 400 + 308 + 296 = 1190\n   - Adjusted for round 2: 1190 * 0.9 = 1071\n\n   The counteroffer's adjusted value is still not 1241, revealing this isn't optimized. Hence, a better optimized counteroffer should focus on ensuring I get enough high-value items without disproportionately dropping value.\n\nAdjusting further:\n\nLet's try to maximize the high-value items while still meeting my minimum threshold:\n\n   - Offer Player 2: [1, 0, 2, 0, 4] \n   - My keeping: [2, 1, 6, 4, 3]\n   - Value to me = (2 * 66) + (1 * 54) + (6 * 80) + (4 * 77) + (3 * 74) = 132 + 54 + 480 + 308 + 222 = 1196\n   - Adjusted for round 2: 1196 * 0.9 = 1076.4\n\nGiven these calculations:\n- Even an adjusted better counteroffer doesn\u2019t provide more than 1241 adjusted.\n- Therefore, rather than pushing further based on assumptions about Player 2, given the insufficiency, the prudent action could still be to stick with the outside offer rather than attempting to force unequal worth further.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 2, 0, 4]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 732. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1182 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 0, 4, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    68 x 0 + 97 x 2 + 95 x 0 + 64 x 4 + 70 x 4\n    which is 730 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 732. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

This means that offers in later rounds are worth less to me.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [1, 0, 1, 1, 1].

I should prioritize making a counteroffer now to maximize my potential discounted value.\n\nI will make a counteroffer of [1, 0, 0, 0, 0], as calculated above it will give me a value greater than 732.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 0, 4, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    68 x 0 + 97 x 2 + 95 x 0 + 64 x 4 + 70 x 4\n    which is 730 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 732. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 732\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 68, Item 2: 97, Item 3: 95, Item 4: 64, Item 5: 70\n*   **Total pool of items:** Item 1: 5, Item 2: 2, Item 3: 2, Item 4: 4, Item 5: 4\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 0.9^2 = 0.81 times its face value, and in round 2 it's worth 0.9 times its face value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]. This means I would receive:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 68 = 68\n    *   0 units of item 2: 0 * 97 = 0\n    *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 95 = 95\n    *   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 64 = 64\n    *   1 unit of item 5: 1 * 70 = 70\n    *   Total value of current offer: 68 + 0 + 95 + 64 + 70 = 297\n    *   Discounted value of current offer: 297 * 0.9 = 267.3\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** 267.3 < 732. Accepting this offer is worse than walking away.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Let's consider a few counteroffers and calculate their value.\n    *Counteroffer 1: Give Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Then I keep everything.\n    My value = 5*68 + 2*97 + 2*95 + 4*64 + 4*70 = 340 + 194 + 190 + 256 + 280 = 1260\n    Discounted Value = 1260 * 0.9 = 1134\n\n    *Counteroffer 2: Give Player 1 [2, 1, 1, 2, 2]. Then I keep [3, 1, 1, 2, 2]\n    My value = 3*68 + 1*97 + 1*95 + 2*64 + 2*70 = 204 + 97 + 95 + 128 + 140 = 664\n    Discounted Value = 664 * 0.9 = 597.6.  This is worse than my outside offer.\n\n    *Counteroffer 3: Give Player 1 [1, 0, 0, 1, 1]. I keep [4, 2, 2, 3, 3]\n    My value = 4*68 + 2*97 + 2*95 + 3*64 + 3*70 = 272 + 194 + 190 + 192 + 210 = 1058\n    Discounted Value = 1058 * 0.9 = 952.2\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is significantly worse than my outside offer.\n*   I need to make a counteroffer that has a higher discounted value than my outside offer.\n*   Counteroffer 1 is clearly the best possible value but offering nothing or everything is suboptimal in the middle rounds.\n*   If I offer [1, 0, 0, 1, 1] my discounted value is 952.2. Player 1 might accept.\n\nNow I'll try to make Player 1 believe I will walk if they don't offer something reasonable. I offered slightly more in the last round.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

We're in round 3, so if a deal happens now, the value to me will be multiplied by 0.9^2, which is 0.81.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer: The current offer value to me is 0, which is far below my outside offer of 712.\n   - Potential counteroffers: I need to propose a counteroffer that gives me more value than 712.\n   - For a potential counteroffer, consider keeping as many high-value items as possible. I will value the items I retain using my utility:\n\n     Let's start with a generous offer:\n     - If I propose to give Player 2: [2, 0, 0, 0, 4], I would keep [3, 2, 2, 4, 0].\n     - Value calculation for me: \n       - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270\n       - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 16 = 32\n       - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 93 = 186\n       - 4 units of item 4 = 4 \u00d7 83 = 332\n       - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 72 = 0\n       - Total value = 820\n\n     This value is > 712, meaning it's better than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - Since accepting the current offer gives me a value of 0, which is less than 712, I cannot ACCEPT.\n   - Walking away would give me 712, which is better than accepting, but not better than the possible counteroffer value of 820.\n   - Therefore, it's beneficial to propose a counteroffer that yields at least 820. \n\nGiven this analysis, my decision is to propose a counteroffer that maximizes my value above the outside offer while still making a reasonable division of items.

Since this is round 3, the discount factor is 0.9^(3-1) = 0.9^2 = 0.81\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** Player 1 offers me [2, 0, 0, 0, 4]. This means I get 2 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5.\n    My value for this offer: (2 * 68) + (0 * 97) + (0 * 95) + (0 * 64) + (4 * 70) = 136 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 280 = 416\n    Discounted value of current offer: 416 * 0.81 = 336.96\n\n*   Comparison to outside offer: 336.96 < 732.  The current offer is worse than my outside offer.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:**  I need to ensure my counteroffer yields a value greater than my outside offer. I have the following items:\n    *   Item 1: 5 total, Player 1 offered 2 to me, therefore I offer 3 to P1.\n    *   Item 2: 2 total, Player 1 offered 0 to me, therefore I offer 2 to P1.\n    *   Item 3: 2 total, Player 1 offered 0 to me, therefore I offer 2 to P1.\n    *   Item 4: 4 total, Player 1 offered 0 to me, therefore I offer 4 to P1.\n    *   Item 5: 4 total, Player 1 offered 4 to me, therefore I offer 0 to P1.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I keep at least my outside offer value. Let's try to find a split that gives me a value above 732.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\nSince the current offer (with a discounted value of 336.96) is much worse than my outside offer of 732, I should not accept. As this is the final round, if I offer a counteroffer it is treated as a walk. Therefore, I should walk away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 263. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 263. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 324 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 4, 3, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    7 x 1 + 9 x 4 + 35 x 3 + 44 x 2 + 13 x 2\n    which is 262 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 263. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

                    "response": "To make a well-informed decision, let's walk through the analysis step-by-step:\n\n1. **Analysis of Current Situation:**\n   - My outside offer value: 263.\n   - Values of the items to me:\n     - Item 1: 7 per unit\n     - Item 2: 9 per unit\n     - Item 3: 35 per unit\n     - Item 4: 44 per unit\n     - Item 5: 13 per unit\n   - Total pool of items:\n     - Item 1: 4 units\n     - Item 2: 4 units\n     - Item 3: 3 units\n     - Item 4: 2 units\n     - Item 5: 5 units\n   - The discount factor (gamma = 0.9) reduces the value of deals accepted in later rounds, but since we are in round 1, this factor doesn't immediately apply for the initial offer.\n\n2. **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n   - Current offer value: None, so no current offer to evaluate against.\n   - Potential counteroffers: Any proposed division must provide me with at least my outside offer value of 263. I will need to ensure the counteroffer value exceeds 263.\n   \n   To maximize my own value while making a reasonable offer, let's allocate most of the high-value items to myself and consider the following counteroffer:\n   - Offer Player 2: 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n   - My retained items: 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 3 units of item 5.\n   \n   Calculating the value to me for this proposal:\n   - Value from item 1 = 4 \u00d7 7 = 28\n   - Value from item 2 = 4 \u00d7 9 = 36\n   - Value from item 3 = 3 \u00d7 35 = 105\n   - Value from item 4 = 1 \u00d7 44 = 44\n   - Value from item 5 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39\n   - Total value = 28 + 36 + 105 + 44 + 39 = 252\n\n   This value does not exceed my outside offer of 263. I need a new arrangement to guarantee more value than 263.\n\n3. **Revise the Offer to Maximize My Outcome:**\n   Let's adjust accordingly: Keep more of the high-value items.\n   - Offer Player 2: 0 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5.\n   - My retained items: 4 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5.\n   \n   Recalculate the total value:\n   - Value from item 1 = 4 \u00d7 7 = 28\n   - Value from item 2 = 2 \u00d7 9 = 18\n   - Value from item 3 = 3 \u00d7 35 = 105\n   - Value from item 4 = 2 \u00d7 44 = 88\n   - Value from item 5 = 4 \u00d7 13 = 52\n   - Total value = 28 + 18 + 105 + 88 + 52 = 291\n\n   The value of 291 is greater than my outside option of 263, making this a viable counteroffer.\n\n4. **Decision:**\n   I will propose this counteroffer as it maximizes my value above my outside offer and is a strategic initial proposal in the negotiation.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 0, 0, 1]}\n```",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 263. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 263. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 324 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 4, 3, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    7 x 1 + 9 x 4 + 35 x 3 + 44 x 2 + 13 x 2\n    which is 262 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 263. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 0, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 1, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 1, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To make a decision in this negotiation, I'll follow a systematic approach that considers the value of the current offer, my outside offer, and potential counteroffers:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n- **My outside offer value:** 263\n- **Values of items:**\n  - Item 1: 7\n  - Item 2: 9\n  - Item 3: 35\n  - Item 4: 44\n  - Item 5: 13\n- **Total pool of items:** 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5.\n- **Discount factor:** If accepting after more rounds, value is multiplied by the discount factor.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n- **Current offer to me:** [0, 1, 1, 0, 0]\n  - Item 2: 1 unit \u00d7 9 = 9\n  - Item 3: 1 unit \u00d7 35 = 35\n  - Total value = 9 + 35 = 44\n\nAssuming the value decreases with rounds (discount factor of 0.9), still in round 2, but value is significantly below 263.\n\n- **Assess potential counteroffers:**\n  - I should aim to retain at least a combination of items that gives me a total value greater than 263.\n\nLet's try [1, 0, 2, 2, 2] for me (offered to Player 2: [3, 4, 1, 0, 3]):\n  - Item 1: 1 unit \u00d7 7 = 7\n  - Item 3: 2 units \u00d7 35 = 70\n  - Item 4: 2 units \u00d7 44 = 88\n  - Item 5: 2 units \u00d7 13 = 26\n  - Total value = 7 + 70 + 88 + 26 = 191\n\nAnother potential distribution:\n- [0, 2, 2, 1, 3] for me (offered to Player 2: [4, 2, 1, 1, 2]):\n  - Item 2: 2 units \u00d7 9 = 18\n  - Item 3: 2 units \u00d7 35 = 70\n  - Item 4: 1 unit \u00d7 44 = 44\n  - Item 5: 3 units \u00d7 13 = 39\n  - Total value = 18 + 70 + 44 + 39 = 171\n\nI need to adjust to maintain a value higher than my outside offer. For instance, trying to keep more units of higher-valued items like item 4 and 3, possibly testing my hold by keeping almost all of them.\n\nExample:\n- Let's try [1, 2, 0, 1, 2] for me (offered to Player 2: [3, 2, 3, 1, 3]):\n  - Item 1: 1 unit \u00d7 7 = 7\n  - Item 2: 2 units \u00d7 9 = 18\n  - Item 4: 1 unit \u00d7 44 = 44\n  - Item 5: 2 units \u00d7 13 = 26\n  - Total value = 7 + 18 + 44 + 26 = 95\n\nThis confirms we aren't reaching above my outside offer. We need even more careful balancing.\n\nUltimately [3, 2, 1, 0, 2] for me (offered to Player 2: [1, 2, 2, 2, 3]):\n  - Item 1: 3 units \u00d7 7 = 21\n  - Item 2: 2 units \u00d7 9 = 18\n  - Item 3: 1 unit \u00d7 35 = 35\n  - Item 5: 2 units \u00d7 13 = 26\n  - Total value = 21 + 18 + 35 + 0 + 26 = 100\n\nSeems like all except item 4 gives best shot, yet still low below outside offer.\n\n### Step 3: Decision\n- **Current offer value is 44**, which is way below outside offer of 263.\n- **Counteroffers tested do not maximize over 263.**\n- **Taking WALK** since remaining potential improvements significantly less than outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 108. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 591 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 0, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    17 x 1 + 72 x 0 + 61 x 0 + 2 x 0 + 45 x 2\n    which is 107 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 108. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 0, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 108\n*   My item values: item 1: 17, item 2: 72, item 3: 61, item 4: 2, item 5: 45\n*   Total item pool: 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5.\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means that deals in later rounds are worth less to me.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 2]. This means I would receive 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n    *   Value of current offer: (0 * 17) + (1 * 72) + (0 * 61) + (0 * 2) + (2 * 45) = 0 + 72 + 0 + 0 + 90 = 162\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what I would keep for myself and offer the rest to Player 1. I want to ensure my value is greater than 108.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is worth 162 to me. Since 162 > 108, accepting the current offer is better than walking away.\n\nTherefore, I should accept the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

This is also not good enough.\n\n      Let's try keeping [5, 3, 4, 8, 1]:\n      (5 * 79) + (3 * 31) + (4 * 83) + (8 * 40) + (1 * 32) = 395 + 93 + 332 + 320 + 32 = 1172. This is the most I could possibly get! So anything given to the other player makes me strictly worse off than my outside offer.\n      However, since I have to make a counteroffer, let's try to improve on player 1's offer a little bit. They are offering me [3, 1, 2, 4, 0]. This implies they are keeping [2, 2, 2, 4, 1].\n       The value of them keeping [2, 2, 2, 4, 1] for me is unknown without their values. Let's try to give them a little more of the worst value item for me and take a little more of the best item for me.\n       Give player 1: [3, 1, 1, 4, 0]\n       My value for keeping [2, 2, 3, 4, 1]:\n       (2 * 79) + (2 * 31) + (3 * 83) + (4 * 40) + (1 * 32) = 158 + 62 + 249 + 160 + 32 = 661. This is still less than my outside offer!\n\n   - Let me determine the minimum that would make sense here in round 1. I know that walking away gives me 1094. If I accept in round 2, my value has to be >= 1094 / 0.9 = 1215.56. That is impossible! So I should just walk!\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   - The current offer is significantly worse than my outside offer.\n   - Any offer I make reduces me below my outside offer.\n   - Since round 1 ends with a walk, I walk.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 5, 3, 5, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    20 x 0 + 6 x 5 + 5 x 3 + 90 x 5 + 8 x 1\n    which is 503 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 504. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 5, 3, 5, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    20 x 0 + 6 x 5 + 5 x 3 + 90 x 5 + 8 x 1\n    which is 503 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 504. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 3, 2, 2, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Since we are in round 2, the value would be multiplied by 0.9 if concluded this round. \n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n\n   - **Current Offer:** The current offer is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] which offers me no value at all.\n   - **Potential Counteroffers:**\n     - With my previous offer [3, 3, 2, 2, 1], I calculated the value I keep as:\n       - 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 20 = 0\n       - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 6 = 12\n       - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 5 = 10\n       - 6 units of item 4 = 6 \u00d7 90 = 540\n       - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 8 = 8\n       - Total Value = 570\n       - Discounted = 570 \u00d7 0.9 = 513\n\n   - Comparing my previous proposal discounted value of 513 to my outside offer of 504, the previous offer is better.\n\n3) **Make a Decision:**\n\nGiven the above analysis, my current options are:\n\n- **Accept or Walk:** The current offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] gives me zero value, which is much worse than my outside offer. Walking away is better than accepting a zero-value offer.\n- **Propose a Counteroffer:** To avoid mistake 2, I need to make sure my offer gives me a value more than 504. Re-evaluating my previous offer is not necessary because it already achieves a value of 513 when discounted. However, to avoid mistake 1, I should maintain or improve upon my last counteroffer.\n\nSince the [3, 3, 2, 2, 1] counteroffer results in a utility value that is satisfactory and above my outside offer when discounted, I will make another counteroffer keeping this value in mind.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 3, 2, 2, 1]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1135. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 870 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 6, 1, 1, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    73 x 5 + 74 x 6 + 65 x 1 + 18 x 1 + 60 x 4\n    which is 1132 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1135. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To make a well-informed decision about the initial offer, let's analyze the current situation:\n\n1) **Analyze the Current Situation:**\n   - **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer is 1135.\n   - **Values of Items:**\n     - Item 1: 73 per unit\n     - Item 2: 74 per unit\n     - Item 3: 65 per unit\n     - Item 4: 18 per unit\n     - Item 5: 60 per unit\n   - **Total Pool of Items:**\n     - Item 1: 5 units\n     - Item 2: 6 units\n     - Item 3: 2 units\n     - Item 4: 6 units\n     - Item 5: 4 units\n   - **Discount Factor Influence:** Since this is the first round, the discount factor does not yet impact the present value. Future rounds will reduce the effective value of offers due to the 0.9 discount rate.\n\n2) **Propose an Initial Counteroffer:**\n   - I need to keep enough value to surpass my outside offer of 1135.\n   - I will start by calculating a potential offer to the other player that maximizes what I retain while ensuring it exceeds my outside offer.\n   - To find an advantageous division, try allocating units I value less to player 2 (e.g., item 4) while retaining high-value items (e.g., item 1, item 2).\n\n   Here's an example initial counteroffer:\n   - Keep [4, 4, 1, 1, 3] units which means offering [1, 2, 1, 5, 1] to Player 2.\n   - Calculate my total value from these units:\n     - 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 73 = 292\n     - 4 units of item 2 = 4 \u00d7 74 = 296\n     - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 65 = 65\n     - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 18 = 18\n     - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 60 = 180\n     - Total value = 292 + 296 + 65 + 18 + 180 = 851\n\n   The totals are still under my outside offer, suggesting further iterations might be necessary. Let's propose retaining [5, 5, 1, 0, 3] units which means offering [0, 1, 1, 6, 1] to Player 2.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n   - Calculate based on [5, 5, 1, 0, 3]:\n     - 5 units of item 1 = 5 \u00d7 73 = 365\n     - 5 units of item 2 = 5 \u00d7 74 = 370\n     - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 65 = 65\n     - 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 18 = 0\n     - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 60 = 180\n     - Total value = 980\n   - If this doesn't exceed, consider [5, 6, 0, 0, 3]:\n     - 5 units of item 1 = 5 \u00d7 73 = 365\n     - 6 units of item 2 = 6 \u00d7 74 = 444\n     - 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 65 = 0\n     - 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 18 = 0\n     - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 60 = 180\n     - Total value = 989\n\nMy initial calculated offer appears suboptimal to meet the immediate outside offer. I'll attempt a revision where I increase my retained higher-valued items:\n\nCounteroffer example after reassessment:\n- Keep [5, 6, 1, 0, 4] items (offering [0, 0, 1, 6, 0] to Player 2).\n\nProceeding with:\n- 5 units of item 1: 365\n- 6 units of item 2: 444\n- 1 unit of item 3: 65\n- 0 unit of item 4: 0\n- 4 units of item 5: 240\n- Total= 1114\n\nSince the resulting total is still slightly below 1135, another adjustment to propose a stronger offer would be ideal. Given these values and strategic rationale:\n\n**Counsel: Future offers, including retaining one additional at the potential decrement, beyond first calculation constraints, should be advisable. Since this exceeds, it's not unfavorable.\n\nI will offer a more likely optimal solution:\n- Based on strategic analysis and adjustments: {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 6, 0]} for best impact value exceeding prior unless subsequently counter-demanded basis testing for cooperative reciprocity** *Diminishing provisional by increase*.\n \n- Adhering to counter offer action: \n\n```\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 6, 0]}  \n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 39. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 612 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 0, 3, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    13 x 1 + 54 x 0 + 67 x 0 + 8 x 3 + 62 x 0\n    which is 37 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 39. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To make a strategic decision, let's break down the scenario using the provided guidelines and data:\n\n1. **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - **Outside offer value:** My outside offer is 39.\n   - **Values of the items for me:** \n     - Item 1: 13\n     - Item 2: 54\n     - Item 3: 67\n     - Item 4: 8\n     - Item 5: 62\n   - **Total pool of items:** \n     - 3 units of item 1\n     - 7 units of item 2\n     - 3 units of item 3\n     - 5 units of item 4\n     - 5 units of item 5\n   - **Discount factor:** With a discount rate of gamma = 0.9, future offers will be valued less if more rounds are taken due to the exponent on the discount factor increasing.\n\n2. **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** None on the table.\n   - **Potential counteroffers:**\n     - I need the total value of the offer I keep to be higher than my outside offer value of 39 to avoid Mistake 2 (making worse offers than the outside offer).\n\n3. **Potential Counteroffer Calculation:**\n   - I want to construct an offer where my value is comfortably above 39.\n   - Prioritize high-value items for me while considering leaving some items I value less for Player 2 to appeal to their interests.\n\nLet's try a counteroffer where I maintain a high total value:\n\n- **Keep 1 item 1, 5 items 2, 1 item 3, 2 items 4, 2 items 5** (giving away 2 item 1, 2 items 2, 2 items 3, 3 items 4, 3 items 5):\n  - My value from keeping:\n    - Item 1: 1 \u00d7 13 = 13\n    - Item 2: 5 \u00d7 54 = 270\n    - Item 3: 1 \u00d7 67 = 67\n    - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 8 = 16\n    - Item 5: 2 \u00d7 62 = 124\n  - Total value for me = 13 + 270 + 67 + 16 + 124 = 490\n\nSince 490 is significantly higher than my outside offer of 39, this is a viable first round counteroffer strategy. This counteroffer avoids Mistake 2 (making an offer worse for me than the outside option) and stays away from other common mistakes.\n\nGiven this reasoning, my action will be:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 2, 3, 3]}\n```",

This means waiting reduces the potential value of a deal.\n\n2) **Assess the value of the current offer:**\n   - Current offer to me: [2, 2, 2, 3, 3]\n   - This means I keep: [3-2, 7-2, 3-2, 5-3, 5-3] = [1, 5, 1, 2, 2]\n   - Value of current offer to me: (1 * 63) + (5 * 47) + (1 * 86) + (2 * 25) + (2 * 90) = 63 + 235 + 86 + 50 + 180 = 614\n   - The current offer gives me a value of 614.\n\n3) **Compare to outside offer:**\n    - My outside offer is 1255. The current offer (614) is significantly lower than my outside offer.\n\n4) **Consider a counteroffer:** I need to find an offer that gives me a value greater than 1255. Let's consider keeping nearly all of the high-value items. How about offering only the following to Player 1:\n   - Item 1: 0\n   - Item 2: 2\n   - Item 3: 0\n   - Item 4: 0\n   - Item 5: 0\n   - So the offer is [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\n   - This means I keep: [3, 5, 3, 5, 5]\n   - My value = (3 * 63) + (5 * 47) + (3 * 86) + (5 * 25) + (5 * 90) = 189 + 235 + 258 + 125 + 450 = 1257\n   - 1257 is greater than my outside offer.\n\n5) **Make a decision:**\n   - Accepting the current offer is bad.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1255. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 933 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 6, 3, 3, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    63 x 3 + 47 x 6 + 86 x 3 + 25 x 3 + 90 x 5\n    which is 1254 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1255. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 2, 3, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 5, 1, 3, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 5, 1, 3, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best course of action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 1255\n*   **My item values:** item 1: 63, item 2: 47, item 3: 86, item 4: 25, item 5: 90\n*   **Total item pool:** item 1: 3, item 2: 7, item 3: 3, item 4: 5, item 5: 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9.  This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its face value to me, and an offer accepted in round 3 would be worth 0.81 times its face value to me.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 5, 1, 3, 2]. This means I would receive:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 63 = 63\n    *   5 units of item 2: 5 * 47 = 235\n    *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 86 = 86\n    *   3 units of item 4: 3 * 25 = 75\n    *   2 units of item 5: 2 * 90 = 180\n    *   Total value of current offer: 63 + 235 + 86 + 75 + 180 = 639\n    *   Adjusted for discount: 639 * 0.9 = 575.1\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer, adjusted for the discount factor, is worth 575.1 to me. This is significantly less than my outside offer of 1255. Accepting this offer would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\n\n*   **Consider previous rounds' offers:**\n    * Round 1 Offer to Player 1: [0, 2, 0, 0, 0].  This means I kept [3, 5, 3, 5, 5]\n    * Round 1 My Value: 3*63 + 5*47 + 3*86 + 5*25 + 5*90 = 1394\n    * Round 1 Adjusted Value: 1394 * 0.9^0 = 1394\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to propose a counteroffer that is worth more than 1255 to me after the discount.\n    If I walk away I get 1255.\n    I need to keep more items for myself!\n\n    I will try to determine the minimum I need to keep to exceed my outside offer, and offer the rest to Player 1.\n    Let's start by giving Player 1 nothing and then take away items until I am below my outside offer.\n    Keeping [3, 7, 3, 5, 5] gives me:\n    3 * 63 + 7 * 47 + 3 * 86 + 5 * 25 + 5 * 90 = 1634\n    Keeping [3, 6, 3, 5, 5] gives me:\n    3 * 63 + 6 * 47 + 3 * 86 + 5 * 25 + 5 * 90 = 1587\n    Keeping [3, 5, 3, 5, 5] gives me:\n    3 * 63 + 5 * 47 + 3 * 86 + 5 * 25 + 5 * 90 = 1540\n    Keeping [3, 5, 3, 5, 4] gives me:\n    3 * 63 + 5 * 47 + 3 * 86 + 5 * 25 + 4 * 90 = 1450\n    Keeping [3, 5, 3, 4, 4] gives me:\n    3 * 63 + 5 * 47 + 3 * 86 + 4 * 25 + 4 * 90 = 1425\n    Keeping [3, 5, 3, 3, 4] gives me:\n    3 * 63 + 5 * 47 + 3 * 86 + 3 * 25 + 4 * 90 = 1400\n    Keeping [3, 5, 3, 3, 3] gives me:\n    3 * 63 + 5 * 47 + 3 * 86 + 3 * 25 + 3 * 90 = 1310\n    Keeping [3, 5, 2, 3, 3] gives me:\n    3 * 63 + 5 * 47 + 2 * 86 + 3 * 25 + 3 * 90 = 1224\n\n    Keeping [3, 6, 3, 5, 4] gives me:\n    3 * 63 + 6 * 47 + 3 * 86 + 5 * 25 + 4 * 90 = 1360\n    Which means offering Player 1 [0, 1, 0, 0, 1] would result in me keeping [3, 6, 3, 5, 4]\n\n    Discounted value of offer = 1360 * 0.9 = 1224\n    Still less than 1255, so it would be a mistake (Mistake 2)\n\n    Let's try another offer:\n    Keeping [3, 6, 3, 4, 5] gives me:\n    3 * 63 + 6 * 47 + 3 * 86 + 4 * 25 + 5 * 90 = 1465\n    Discounted value of offer = 1465 * 0.9 = 1318.5\n    Which means offering Player 1 [0, 1, 0, 1, 0] would result in me keeping [3, 6, 3, 4, 5]\n\n    This is greater than 1255\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is terrible. My outside offer is much better. I will make a counteroffer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]}\n",

Therefore, any value needs to be multiplied by \\( 0.9^{(2-1)} = 0.9 \\).\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer Value**: The current offer on the table gives me [0, 5, 0, 0, 0] which translates to:\n  - 0 units of Item 1 = 0\n  - 5 units of Item 2 = 5 \u00d7 65 = 325\n  - 0 units of Item 3 = 0\n  - 0 units of Item 4 = 0\n  - 0 units of Item 5 = 0\n  - Total = 325\n\n  Adjusted for the discount: \\(325 \\times 0.9 = 292.5\\)\n\n- **My previous offer**: [0, 3, 3, 1, 1]\n  - 3 units of Item 2 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195\n  - 3 units of Item 3 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207\n  - 1 unit of Item 4 = 1 \u00d7 42 = 42\n  - 1 unit of Item 5 = 1 \u00d7 64 = 64\n  - Total = 508 \n\n  Adjusted for discount: \\(508 \\times 0.9 = 457.2\\)\n\n- **Potential counteroffers**: Any counteroffer must be more valuable than 4 to justify not walking away.

Walking away would be a mistake because it gives me less value.\n- However, my previous offer adjusted for the discount was more valuable than the current offer.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 857. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 738 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 3, 4, 4, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    29 x 2 + 20 x 3 + 61 x 4 + 86 x 4 + 50 x 3\n    which is 856 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 857. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 3, 3, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 5, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 4, 2, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 4, 2, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

This means offers in later rounds are worth less.\n\n2.  **Assess the value of the current offer:**\n    *   Current offer: [0, 4, 2, 1, 1] (This is what *I* receive).\n    *   My value of the current offer: (0 * 29) + (4 * 20) + (2 * 61) + (1 * 86) + (1 * 50) = 0 + 80 + 122 + 86 + 50 = 338\n    *   Since 338 < 857, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away and taking my outside offer.\n\n3.  **Consider a counteroffer:**  I need to find an offer that gives me more value than 857. Since this is round 2, I need to factor in the discount rate.\n\nLet's examine the total value of the items to me:\n(3 * 29) + (6 * 20) + (6 * 61) + (4 * 86) + (3 * 50) = 87 + 120 + 366 + 344 + 150 = 1067\n\nNow, let's consider keeping all the items:\nItem 1: 3 units\nItem 2: 6 units\nItem 3: 6 units\nItem 4: 4 units\nItem 5: 3 units\n\nKeeping all these items results in a value of 1067.\n\nI need to offer something to Player 1, but I want to keep enough items to have a value greater than my outside offer of 857.\n\nLet's try offering [0, 2, 1, 0, 0] to Player 1. This means I keep [3, 4, 5, 4, 3].\nMy value = (3 * 29) + (4 * 20) + (5 * 61) + (4 * 86) + (3 * 50) = 87 + 80 + 305 + 344 + 150 = 966\n\nSince 966 > 857, this offer is better than walking away.\n\n4. **Decision:** Propose the counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 1, 0, 0]}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This means accepting an offer in a later round is worth less than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]. This means I get 1 unit of item 3.\n    *   Value of accepting the current offer: 1 * 93 = 93\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** 93 > 58. Accepting the current offer is better than my outside offer.\n\nLet's consider the possibility of a counteroffer. I could try to get more value, but I need to be careful not to make an offer worse than my outside offer or worse than the current offer in terms of what I get to keep.\n\nFor example, if I kept everything, my total value would be:\n3 * 8 + 4 * 72 + 3 * 93 + 3 * 100 + 2 * 91 = 24 + 288 + 279 + 300 + 182 = 1073\n\nLet's consider offering Player 1 all of item 1, half of item 2, all of item 3, and half of item 4. This means I would be offering [3, 2, 3, 1, 0]. In this case, I would keep [0, 2, 0, 2, 2].\n\nThe value to me would be:\n0 * 8 + 2 * 72 + 0 * 93 + 2 * 100 + 2 * 91 = 0 + 144 + 0 + 200 + 182 = 526\n\nI could offer [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]. In this case, I would keep [2, 3, 3, 3, 2]. The value to me would be:\n2 * 8 + 3 * 72 + 3 * 93 + 3 * 100 + 2 * 91 = 16 + 216 + 279 + 300 + 182 = 993\n\nI could also accept the offer since 93 > 58.\nAccepting gives me 93 now.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\nSince the current offer (93) is already better than my outside offer (58), and the discount factor is 0.9, there is no guarantee I will get a better offer if I wait. Therefore, I should accept the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 0, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    70 x 1 + 54 x 1 + 7 x 0 + 15 x 1 + 45 x 0\n    which is 139 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 142. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 0, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    70 x 1 + 54 x 1 + 7 x 0 + 15 x 1 + 45 x 0\n    which is 139 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 142. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 2, 0, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 1, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 1, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To make a decision, let's evaluate the current situation:\n\n### 1) Analyze the current situation:\n- **Outside offer value**: 142\n- **Values of the items involved**:\n  - Item 1: 70\n  - Item 2: 54\n  - Item 3: 7\n  - Item 4: 15\n  - Item 5: 45\n- **Total pool of items**: 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 4 units of item 5\n- **Discount factor**: The discount factor of 0.9 influences the negotiation, reducing overall values in later rounds. This is round 2, so the discount factor is 0.9^1 = 0.9.\n\n### 2) Assess the value of offers:\n- **Current offer from Player 2**: [0, 0, 1, 0, 1]\n  - Value from items: \n    - Item 3: 1 \u00d7 7 = 7\n    - Item 5: 1 \u00d7 45 = 45\n  - Total value without discount = 7 + 45 = 52\n  - Total value with discount = 52 \u00d7 0.9 = 46.8\n\nThe value of the current offer (46.8) is less than my outside offer (142). Thus, the offer is not advantageous.\n\n- **Evaluate potential counteroffers**:\n  \n  To check a potential valid counteroffer:\n  - If I keep more valuable items and offer less valuable ones to Player 2 and compare them to my outside offer.\n  - For example: Keeping [1, 2, 1, 1, 3] and offering [0, 0, 1, 0, 1] (current offer) potentially undervalues my position.\n  \n  To find a better offer:\n  - Total available value if I keep everything minus 1 unit of each item:\n    - 1 unit of item 1 = 70\n    - 2 units of item 2 = 108\n    - 1 unit of item 3 = 7\n    - 1 unit of item 4 = 15\n    - 3 units of item 5 = 135\n    - Total value = 335 \n  - Check potential useful increase in the counteroffer from the original position.\n\n- **Counterexample**:\n  - Original position: [0, 1, 2, 0, 2]\n  - There was an initial reasonable offer, slightly modify to gain giving me more baseline value:\n  - Example of reasonable change: [0, 1, 1, 0, 2]\n  - Evaluation for such counter: \n  - Item values kept to me:\n    - 1 unit of item 1 = 70\n    - 1 unit of item 2 = 54\n    - 1 unit of item 3 = 7\n    - 1 unit of item 4 = 15\n    - 2 units of item 5 = 90\n  - Total estimated value = 236\n\nGiven that this counteroffer vector surpasses the outside offer and is presented adjusted by the discount factor, counterproposing the initial offer with better conditions should be more strategic.\n\n### 3) Make a decision:\nSince the value of the current offer (46.8) is lower than my outside offer (142), it's not in my interest to accept it, nor is walking away the optimal choice right now given room for strategic negotiation. \n\nThus, a counteroffer should have superior value or equal offer consideration: Offering [0, 1, 1, 0, 2] gives flexibility while adhering to negotiation wins.\n  \n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 1, 0, 2]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 310. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 732 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 2, 0, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    33 x 0 + 74 x 0 + 39 x 2 + 24 x 0 + 74 x 3\n    which is 300 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 310. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 158. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 462 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 1, 3, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    76 x 1 + 11 x 0 + 39 x 1 + 7 x 3 + 21 x 1\n    which is 157 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 158. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 3, 3, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 3, 3, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value: 158\n   - My item values: item 1 = 76, item 2 = 11, item 3 = 39, item 4 = 7, item 5 = 21\n   - Total items: 3 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 3 of item 4, 1 of item 5\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means that offers in later rounds are worth less to me in present value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** [0, 1, 3, 3, 0] (This is what Player 1 is offering ME)\n     This means I would get:\n     - 3 units of item 1: 3 * 76 = 228\n     - 1 unit of item 2: 1 * 11 = 11\n     - 1 unit of item 3: 1 * 39 = 39\n     - 0 units of item 4: 0 * 7 = 0\n     - 1 unit of item 5: 1 * 21 = 21\n     Total value of current offer = 228 + 11 + 39 + 0 + 21 = 299\n\n     Since 299 > 158, accepting this offer is better than walking away right now.\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:**\n      I need to ensure that the value of the items I keep is greater than 158. Let's see if I can find a better offer for myself than what's on the table by offering less. I should always offer at least one item to avoid Mistake 3. I need to make sure the total offered quantities does not exceed the available stock.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer has a value of 299, which is greater than my outside option of 158.\nI will explore a potential counteroffer. Let's try offering player 1:\n[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nThis means I keep:\n- 2 of item 1: 2 * 76 = 152\n- 2 of item 2: 2 * 11 = 22\n- 4 of item 3: 4 * 39 = 156\n- 3 of item 4: 3 * 7 = 21\n- 1 of item 5: 1 * 21 = 21\nTotal value is 152 + 22 + 156 + 21 + 21 = 372\n\nI will explore another potential counteroffer. Let's try offering player 1:\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nThis means I keep:\n- 3 of item 1: 3 * 76 = 228\n- 2 of item 2: 2 * 11 = 22\n- 4 of item 3: 4 * 39 = 156\n- 3 of item 4: 3 * 7 = 21\n- 1 of item 5: 1 * 21 = 21\nTotal value is 228 + 22 + 156 + 21 + 21 = 448\n\nI will explore another potential counteroffer. Let's try offering player 1:\n[1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\nThis means I keep:\n- 2 of item 1: 2 * 76 = 152\n- 1 of item 2: 1 * 11 = 11\n- 3 of item 3: 3 * 39 = 117\n- 2 of item 4: 2 * 7 = 14\n- 1 of item 5: 1 * 21 = 21\nTotal value is 152 + 11 + 117 + 14 + 21 = 315\n\nSince 299 > 158, accepting the current offer is better than walking away. All the counteroffers above result in a better result too. However, I should still make a counteroffer since it's round 1. I should make a counteroffer that I would prefer over the current offer. Therefore I should make counteroffer [1, 1, 1, 1, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]}\n```",

This means that an agreement in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its actual value, and an agreement in round 3 is worth 0.9^2 = 0.81 times its actual value.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 0, 1, 3, 0]. This means I receive 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n    *   My value from this offer: (0 * 76) + (0 * 11) + (1 * 39) + (3 * 7) + (0 * 21) = 0 + 0 + 39 + 21 + 0 = 60\n    *   Discounted value of current offer (round 2): 60 * 0.9 = 54\n    *   Since 54 is less than my outside offer of 158, accepting the current offer would be Mistake 4.\n\n*   **Consider a potential counteroffer:** I need to make sure any counteroffer leaves me with at least 158 / 0.9 = 175.56 value in round 2 terms, or 158 / 0.81 = 195.06 value in round 3 terms.\n\nLet's calculate what I have if I reject the current offer and wait for the final round:\n\nIf I offer Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], I keep everything.\n(3 * 76) + (2 * 11) + (4 * 39) + (3 * 7) + (1 * 21) = 228 + 22 + 156 + 21 + 21 = 448\nThen discounted value in round 3 is 448 * 0.81 = 362.88\n\nOkay. Let's consider what happens if I offer Player 1 items that yield me just above my outside offer * discount factor = 175.56 in round 2.\nLet me calculate with my outside offer 158. Let's target 176.\n\nI can keep:\n3 item 1s = 228. This is more than 176, so let's try to give him some item 1s.\n\nIf I keep 2 item 1s, I have 152.\nIf I keep 2 item 1s and 2 item 2s, I have 152 + 22 = 174.\nIf I keep 2 item 1s, 2 item 2s and 1 item 3, I have 174 + 39 = 213.\nSo I give away 1 item 1 and 3 item 3.\n\nCounteroffer to Player 1: [1, 0, 3, 0, 0]\n\nMy value if Player 1 accepts this:\n(2 * 76) + (2 * 11) + (1 * 39) + (3 * 7) + (1 * 21) = 152 + 22 + 39 + 21 + 21 = 255\nThen discounted value in round 2 is 255 * 0.9 = 229.5.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This means that offers in later rounds are worth less.\n\n2.  **Assess the value of offers:**\n    *   Current offer: Player 1 offers me [0, 3, 0, 0, 0]. This means I get 0 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 0 of item 4, and 0 of item 5. My value for this offer is: (0 \\* 34) + (3 \\* 41) + (0 \\* 79) + (0 \\* 94) + (0 \\* 15) = 123.\n    *   Comparison to outside offer: 123 < 667.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\n1) **Current Situation:**\n   - My outside offer value: 667\n   - My values per item: item 1: 34, item 2: 41, item 3: 79, item 4: 94, item 5: 15\n   - Total items: item 1: 0, item 2: 6, item 3: 5, item 4: 2, item 5: 4\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.9\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer: Player 1 offers me [0, 2, 1, 0, 0].  This means I get 0 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 0 of item 4, and 0 of item 5.\n      - My value from the current offer: (0 * 34) + (2 * 41) + (1 * 79) + (0 * 94) + (0 * 15) = 0 + 82 + 79 + 0 + 0 = 161\n   - If I accept, my discounted value will be 161 * 0.9^(2-1) = 161 * 0.9 = 144.9. This is less than my outside offer of 667.\n\n3) **Consider a Counteroffer:**\n\nI want to find an offer that is better than 667, considering the discount factor of 0.9.\nLet's start by calculating my total possible value:\n(0 * 34) + (6 * 41) + (5 * 79) + (2 * 94) + (4 * 15) = 0 + 246 + 395 + 188 + 60 = 889\n\nSince it's round 2, any deal I make is multiplied by 0.9.\nSo, if I make an offer now, I need to get at least 667/0.9 = 741.11 worth of value.\n\nI am currently offering Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 4]. Let's try offering Player 1 a different offer.\nSince I value item 4 highly, let's try offering them one unit of item 4. This would give me one unit of item 4, worth 94.\nIf I want to reach a value greater than 741.11, I need to keep items worth 741.11. Since I get to keep some items, this is possible.\n\nLet's consider offering player 1 one unit of item 2, one unit of item 3 and one unit of item 4.\nThis means I keep 0 of item 1, 5 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 1 of item 4 and 4 of item 5.\nMy value would be (0 * 34) + (5 * 41) + (4 * 79) + (1 * 94) + (4 * 15) = 0 + 205 + 316 + 94 + 60 = 675.\nThis would mean my discounted value is 675*0.9 = 607.5. This is still less than 667, so I need to keep more items.\n\nI will offer [0, 1, 0, 0, 0] to Player 1.\nThis means I keep 0 of item 1, 5 of item 2, 5 of item 3, 2 of item 4 and 4 of item 5.\nMy value would be (0 * 34) + (5 * 41) + (5 * 79) + (2 * 94) + (4 * 15) = 0 + 205 + 395 + 188 + 60 = 848\nThis would mean my discounted value is 848 * 0.9 = 763.2.\n\nTherefore, my action is to counteroffer with [0, 1, 0, 0, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 638. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 705 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 6, 2, 2, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    42 x 0 + 18 x 6 + 80 x 2 + 6 x 2 + 89 x 4\n    which is 636 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 638. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 523. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 636 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 4, 2, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    14 x 1 + 9 x 0 + 86 x 4 + 58 x 2 + 45 x 1\n    which is 519 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 523. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Consider I offer [0,0,0,0,0].\n- Value = (1 * 14) + (0 * 9) + (4 * 86) + (2 * 58) + (5 * 45) = 14 + 0 + 344 + 116 + 225 = 699\n- Discounted Value = 699 * 0.9 = 629.1\nIf I offer [0,0,0,0,0] it is higher than my outside offer.\n\nI could also propose keeping all of item 3 and giving everything else: offer = [1,0,0,2,5]\n- Value = (0 * 14) + (0 * 9) + (4 * 86) + (0 * 58) + (0 * 45) = 0 + 0 + 344 + 0 + 0 = 344 which is lower than 523\n\nLet's consider another potential counteroffer:\nOffer [0, 0, 0, 1, 2]. I keep [1, 0, 4, 1, 3]\nValue = (1 * 14) + (0 * 9) + (4 * 86) + (1 * 58) + (3 * 45) = 14 + 0 + 344 + 58 + 135 = 551. Discounted value is 551 * 0.9 = 495.9\nThis is also less than 523.\n\nLet's try offering only items 1, 4, and 5. Offer [1, 0, 0, 2, 5]\n- I keep [0, 0, 4, 0, 0]\nValue = (0 * 14) + (0 * 9) + (4 * 86) + (0 * 58) + (0 * 45) = 0 + 0 + 344 + 0 + 0 = 344\nThat's not good.\n\nIt appears that getting something higher than 523 and leaving something on the table for player 1 to accept will be challenging. Let's consider accepting this round and getting 510 which is close to 523, but we have to take gamma into consideration. We have already taken that into consideration. If we do a counter offer, we only get it with a gamma discount.\n\nGiven the options, since this is round 2, let me try a slightly more aggressive offer than before. I'll try to offer 0 of item 3 to Player 1.\nOffer: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]\nI keep: [1, 0, 4, 1, 4]\nValue: 14 + 0 + 344 + 58 + 180 = 596 > 523.  Discounted value is 596 * 0.9 = 536.4\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 224. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 912 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 0, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    27 x 0 + 93 x 0 + 73 x 1 + 61 x 0 + 50 x 3\n    which is 223 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 224. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 2, 0, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 779. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 945 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 1, 1, 4, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    47 x 4 + 40 x 1 + 78 x 1 + 86 x 4 + 64 x 2\n    which is 778 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 779. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 0, 3, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 2, 0, 3, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 779\n*   **My item values:** item 1: 47, item 2: 40, item 3: 78, item 4: 86, item 5: 64\n*   **Total items:** item 1: 4, item 2: 4, item 3: 1, item 4: 5, item 5: 4\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that accepting an offer in a later round is worth less than accepting the same offer now.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** [2, 2, 0, 3, 2] (This is what *I* receive).\n    Value of current offer: (2 * 47) + (2 * 40) + (0 * 78) + (3 * 86) + (2 * 64) = 94 + 80 + 0 + 258 + 128 = 560\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** 560 < 779. Accepting this offer is worse than walking away.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find an offer that gives me a value greater than 779, considering the discount factor. Since it's round 1, the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 1, so the value is not discounted.\n    Let's start by considering an offer where I keep as much as possible while still giving Player 1 something. I need to give Player 1 at least one unit of one of the items, otherwise this becomes Mistake 3.\n    Let's try offering player 1 unit of item 1: [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]. I would keep [3, 4, 1, 5, 4].\n    My value = 3*47 + 4*40 + 1*78 + 5*86 + 4*64 = 141 + 160 + 78 + 430 + 256 = 1065\n\n    Let's try offering [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] as the worst case. This is clearly not going to work but let's compute it anyway to be sure.\n    My value = 4*47 + 4*40 + 1*78 + 5*86 + 4*64 = 188 + 160 + 78 + 430 + 256 = 1112 > 779\n\n    Now, I need to propose an offer that is better than my outside offer. I want to retain the items that I value the most.\n\n    Offer 1: I give player 1 [1, 1, 0, 1, 1]. I keep [3, 3, 1, 4, 3].\n    My value = 3*47 + 3*40 + 1*78 + 4*86 + 3*64 = 141 + 120 + 78 + 344 + 192 = 875 > 779. Good.\n\n    Offer 2: I give player 1 [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]. I keep [4, 3, 1, 5, 4].\n    My value = 4*47 + 3*40 + 1*78 + 5*86 + 4*64 = 188 + 120 + 78 + 430 + 256 = 1072 > 779. Better.\n\n    Offer 3: I give player 1 [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]. I keep [4, 4, 1, 4, 4].\n    My value = 4*47 + 4*40 + 1*78 + 4*86 + 4*64 = 188 + 160 + 78 + 344 + 256 = 1026 > 779.\n\nI want to maximize my value, so I should propose an offer that gives me as much as possible while still giving the other player *something*. It looks like offering one unit of item 2 gives me the highest value.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Accepting the current offer: No (560 < 779)\n*   Walking away: Possibly, but let's try a counteroffer first.\n*   Counteroffer: [0, 1, 0, 0, 0] - Give one unit of item 2 to Player 1.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]}\n",

This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its face value, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 times its face value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I receive [1, 1, 0, 3, 2].\n    *   My value = (1 \\* 47) + (1 \\* 40) + (0 \\* 78) + (3 \\* 86) + (2 \\* 64) = 47 + 40 + 0 + 258 + 128 = 473\n    *   Adjusted for discount factor = 473 * 0.9 = 425.7\n    *   This is significantly lower than my outside offer of 779.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to find an offer that gives me a value greater than my outside offer when discounted.\n    *   Let's aim for a value close to my outside offer, but slightly above it to account for the discount factor. Since we are in round 2, we need a value of at least 779 / 0.9 = 865.56 before discounting.\n    * Let's consider keeping [4, 2, 1, 2, 3].\n    * My value would be: 47 x 4 + 40 x 2 + 78 x 1 + 86 x 2 + 64 x 3 = 188 + 80 + 78 + 172 + 192 = 710.\n\n   * This still falls below my outside offer. Let's try a different offer. I will keep [4, 3, 1, 3, 4].\n    * My value is: 47 x 4 + 40 x 3 + 78 x 1 + 86 x 3 + 64 x 4 = 188 + 120 + 78 + 258 + 256 = 900.\n    * In this scenario I would offer [0, 1, 0, 2, 0] to player 1. The value after the discount factor would be 900 * 0.9 = 810. This exceeds my outside offer of 779.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\n*   The current offer is unacceptable.\n*   Walking away would give me 779.\n*   A counteroffer of [0, 1, 0, 2, 0] is better than walking away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 2, 0]}\n```",

                    "prompt": "\n    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\n    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\n    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\n    There are 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\n    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\n    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 101.\n    Your private values are 70 for item 1, 92 for item 2, 26 for item 3, 40 for item 4, 13 for item 5.\n    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to your total value of all items, which is 926. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 348. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 348. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 723 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 1, 3, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    70 x 1 + 92 x 1 + 26 x 1 + 40 x 3 + 13 x 3\n    which is 347 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 348. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 0, 3, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 3, 2]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 0, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action?
