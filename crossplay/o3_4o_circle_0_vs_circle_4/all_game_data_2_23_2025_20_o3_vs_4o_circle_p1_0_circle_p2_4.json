Assess the value of offers:\n\n- **Value of the current offer**:\n  - 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 74 = 0\n  - 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 88 = 0\n  - 8 units of item 3 = 8 \u00d7 96 = 768\n  - 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 39 = 0\n  - 4 units of item 5 = 4 \u00d7 13 = 52\n  - **Total value** = 0 + 0 + 768 + 0 + 52 = 820\n\n- **Value comparison**:\n  - My value from the current offer (820) is below my outside offer (1163).\n  \n### 3. Make a decision based on the analysis:\n\n- **Condition Check**:\n  - Mistake 4 (Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer): Accepting the current offer would yield a value less than my outside offer.\n  - Therefore, I should not accept the current offer.\n  \nNow, let's consider a potential counteroffer:\n\nTo avoid mistake 2 (making an offer worse for me than my outside offer), any counteroffer should result in a value at or above 1163. \n\nLet's consider a distribution of items that maximizes my value:\n\n- Let's propose that I get:\n  - 3 units of item 1 (3 \u00d7 74 = 222)\n  - 0 units of item 2 (0 \u00d7 88 = 0)\n  - 5 units of item 3 (5 \u00d7 96 = 480)\n  - 3 units of item 4 (3 \u00d7 39 = 117)\n  - 3 units of item 5 (3 \u00d7 13 = 39)\n  - **Total value to me** = 222 + 0 + 480 + 117 + 39 = 858 (This won't work since it's less than 1163, let's tweak)\n\nTo reach a value above or equal to 1163:\n\n- I will keep:\n  - 3 units of item 1 (3 \u00d7 74 = 222)\n  - 1 units of item 3 (1 \u00d7 96 = 96)\n  - 4 units of item 4 (4 \u00d7 39 = 156)\n  - 4 units of item 5 (4 \u00d7 13 = 52)\n  - Total value to me = 222 + 0 + 96 + 156 + 52 = 526\n\nAs reaching 1163 would require most items to be retained by me, thus would only accept if all items given to me. Calculating necessary adjustments for a valid offer at 1163 might exceed constraints, so will walk away given value expected with current offer wouldn't reach requirement.\n\nBased on this, it\u2019s best to not pursue further negotiations and walk away since the outside offer is more valuable for me than any feasible division.\n\n### Final Decision:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

However, if I wait for round 2, the value of any resulting deal will be multiplied by 0.9. \n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer to me: [2, 1, 3, 4, 0]\n     - Value for 2 units of item 1: 2 * 36 = 72\n     - Value for 1 unit of item 2: 1 * 81 = 81\n     - Value for 3 units of item 3: 3 * 66 = 198\n     - Value for 4 units of item 4: 4 * 40 = 160\n     - Value for 0 units of item 5: 0 * 62 = 0\n     - Total value = 72 + 81 + 198 + 160 + 0 = 511\n   \n   - Compare this to my outside offer value of 118.

I need to aim for an offer that increases my value while considering what Player 1 might accept. I could try to obtain more of the higher valued items like item 2 and item 3.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Accepting this would be accepting less than my guaranteed fallback.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n   - Accepting the current offer is not advisable as it gives me less value than my outside offer (Mistake 4).\n   - Walking away now also doesn't maximize my potential value since only one round has been played.\n   - I should propose a counteroffer where my received value has the potential to be more than my outside offer.\n\n**Potential Counteroffer Strategy:**\n   - To ensure my received value exceeds the outside offer, I need to focus on items that I highly value and allocate some less valued or excess items to Player 1.\n   - For instance, I highly value item 3 and item 4, so I should aim to retain as many units of these items as possible.\n\n**Counteroffer Proposal:**\n- Offer Player 1 as follows: [0, 0, 0, 1, 2]\n   - Calculation for my new retained items:\n     - 3 units of item 1 (3 \u00d7 21 = 63)\n     - 3 units of item 2 (3 \u00d7 48 = 144)\n     - 2 units of item 3 (2 \u00d7 86 = 172)\n     - 2 units of item 4 (2 \u00d7 68 = 136)\n     - 2 units of item 5 (2 \u00d7 61 = 122)\n     - Total value of retained items = 637, which is above my outside offer of 627.\n\nGiven these evaluations, I will propose the counteroffer as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 1, 2]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 693. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 870 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 133. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 477 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "To make a decision, let's analyze the current situation step by step:\n\n1) **Analyze the Current Situation:**\n   - My outside offer value: 574\n   - Values of the items involved: \n     - Item 1: 59 \n     - Item 2: 86\n     - Item 3: 13\n     - Item 4: 53\n     - Item 5: 78\n   - Total pool of items: \n     - 5 units of item 1\n     - 3 units of item 2\n     - 4 units of item 3\n     - 5 units of item 4\n     - 0 units of item 5\n   - Discount factor: The discount rate is 0.9, meaning accepting an offer earlier yields a higher present value compared to waiting for future offers due to the discounting effect.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n   - **Current offer being evaluated** (what Player 1 offers me): [0, 0, 4, 5, 0]\n     - Calculate my value for this distribution:\n       - 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 59 = 0\n       - 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 86 = 0\n       - 4 units of item 3 = 4 \u00d7 13 = 52\n       - 5 units of item 4 = 5 \u00d7 53 = 265\n       - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 78 = 0\n       - Total value = 52 + 265 = 317\n     - Compare this to my outside offer: 317 is less than 574.\n     - Therefore, accepting this offer is not beneficial since it is worse than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a Decision Based on the Analysis:**\n   - Accepting the current offer would yield a lower value than my outside offer, violating Mistake 4.\n   - Walking away would ensure I receive my outside offer value of 574.\n   - Making a counteroffer should aim for a value higher than 574. However, in the interest of causing the least disruption and showing potential willingness to negotiate, I can propose a balanced counteroffer to see if a deal closer to my required value can be reached.\n\n   Let's consider a potential counteroffer where I take a majority of the higher valued items considering my interest. For instance:\n   - **Counteroffer:** [2, 1, 0, 3, 0]\n     - Calculate the value for this distribution:\n       - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177\n       - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 86 = 172\n       - 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 13 = 0\n       - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 53 = 106\n       - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 78 = 0\n       - Total value = 177 + 172 + 106 = 455\n     - Although this is less than my outside offer, it is reasonable and aims to improve the offer in subsequent rounds without being suboptimal or unrealistic.\n\nGiven this analysis, here is my action:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 2, 0, 2, 0]}\n```",

It's important to consider future rounds will reduce the value.\n\n2) Assessing the Value of Offers:\n   - Current Offer: [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]\n     - Value for me: (0 \u00d7 77) + (1 \u00d7 71) + (0 \u00d7 96) + (0 \u00d7 43) + (1 \u00d7 42) = 113.\n   - Compare this to my outside offer value of 466, and it's clear that this current offer is significantly less valuable.\n\n3) Decision:\n   - I should not accept the current offer because it is significantly worse than my outside offer.\n   - Walking away would give me a value of 466.\n   - A counteroffer should aim to exceed 466 in total value for me, after considering the discount for future rounds.\n\nTo make a rational counteroffer that maximizes my value above my outside offer, let's calculate a potential split:\n\n- Consider a distribution closer to equal shares especially valuing the high-value items:\n  - 1 unit of item 1 (worth 77 to me)\n  - 1 unit of item 2 (worth 71 to me)\n  - 3 units of item 3 (worth 96 each to me)\n  - 2 units of item 4 (worth 43 to me)\n  - 1 unit of item 5 (worth 42 to me)\n\nCalculate: \n- Value: (1 \u00d7 77) + (1 \u00d7 71) + (3 \u00d7 96) + (2 \u00d7 43) + (1 \u00d7 42) = 77 + 71 + 288 + 86 + 42 = 564\n\nThe offer should leave me with at least 564 because of my superior valuation of item 3.

If we reach round 3, the value of acceptance will be multiplied by 0.9 compared to the current round.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n   - **Evaluate Current Offer [0, 2, 3, 2, 1]:**\n     - Item 2: 2 \u00d7 71 = 142\n     - Item 3: 3 \u00d7 96 = 288\n     - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 43 = 86\n     - Item 5: 1 \u00d7 42 = 42\n     - Total Value = 142 + 288 + 86 + 42 = 558\n\n   Since the current offer's value (558) is higher than my outside offer (466), accepting it would generally be beneficial. However, accepting immediately doesn't factor in the discount rate for future negotiation rounds here, but given the current value is already above the outside offer, the discount isn't a pressing concern.\n\n3) **Decision Making:**\n   - If I accept the current offer, I am achieving an immediate value of 558, which is better than my fallback option of 466.\n   - Counteroffers in round 2 should aim for a better deal, but given the decent margin above my fallback, the current offer is competitive enough.\n\nGiven the calculation and analysis, accepting the current offer is rational as it avoids the mistake of walking away from an offer better than my outside offer.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

For example, keeping more high-value items like item 1 and 5, while giving Player 1 lower-value items or fewer high-value items.\n\n### Counteroffer Proposal\n\nTo improve my value received, I should propose a division where I aim to have more units of item 1 and/or item 5. An example counteroffer could be giving Player 1 fewer units of these.\n\n**Proposed Counteroffer:**\n- I will offer keeping most high-value items for myself:\n  - Offer 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, and 1 of item 4 to Player 1, and less of item 5, maximizing my value in items 1 and 5.\n\nLet's propose giving Player 1 the following:\n- 2 units of item 2 (most practical to residual balance),\n- 2 units of item 3 (as they are of less value to me),\n- 0 units of item 4,\n- 0 units of item 5, maximizing my gain from them.\n\nCalculating my value for this counteroffer:\n- 6 units of item 1 (entirety) = 6 \u00d7 87 = 522\n- 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 37 = 74\n- 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 9  = 9\n- 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 12 = 12\n- 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 59 = 59\n\n**Verify Value:**\n- Total value = \\( 522 + 74 + 9 + 12 + 59 = 676 \\)\n\nSince 676 is greater than my outside offer of 530, I can propose the trade-off below:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 2, 0, 0]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

Let's improve this allocation.\n\n#### Adjusted Counteroffer:\n\nLet's try [1, 2, 1, 1, 0]:\n\n1. Calculate the value:\n   - Item 1: 4 units = \\(4 \\times 45 = 180\\)\n   - Item 2: 2 unit = \\(2 \\times 40 = 80\\)\n   - Item 4: 1 unit = \\(1 \\times 45 = 45\\)\n\nTotal Value = \\(180 + 80 + 45 = 305\\)\n\nAfter discount \\(305 \\times 0.9 = 274.5\\)\n\nTo push this over the fallback, further concentrate on high value item 5, let's take an additional unit of Item 5:\n\nCounteroffer: [1, 2, 0, 0, 2] \n\nThis balances possible acquisition of high-value items while respecting previous itemization, prioritizing maintaining valuable quantities limited by unit pools as viable.\n\n#### The Action:\n\nGiven my analysis reflects a preference not exceeding my fallback by offering as such under present restrictions, I will present this counter in attempts to bridge negotiation with possible leftover surplus improvements accordingly:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 1, 1, 0]}\n```\n",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

This means the value of any agreement in the second round is not discounted, but a walk to the third round will reduce the effective value of the agreement.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer ([0, 9, 0, 0, 1]): \n     - Item 2: 9 units \u00d7 84 = 756\n     - Item 5: 1 unit \u00d7 16 = 16\n     - Total value: 756 + 16 = 772\n   - Potential counteroffers: I need to propose offers where my value is significantly more than 830 (to ensure any future discounting still leaves me better off than my outside offer).\n\n3) Make a decision:\n   - The current offer's value (772) is less than my outside offer (830).\n   - Walking away would give me 830.\n   - The existing offers from round 1 and current round indicate Player 1 values item 2 highly but hasn't valued item 4 as much. A counter offer focusing on retention of item 4 and some of item 5 may be beneficial.\n\nA potential counteroffer:\n- Keep more of item 4 due to its high value and return less of item 2, maximizing the items I value highly.\n\nHere's a recalibrated counteroffer maximizing my item value retention:\n   - Offer them 1 item of item 1, 8 of item 2 (as they've offered it fully), 1 of item 3, 2 of item 4, and 4 of item 5.\n\n  - Counteroffer (my plan):\n     - Item 1: 1 \u00d7 7 = 7 (3 kept)\n     - Item 2: 1 \u00d7 84 = 84 (8 kept)\n     - Item 3: 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (1 kept)\n     - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 69 = 138 (2 kept)\n     - Item 5: 4 \u00d7 16 = 64 (4 kept)\n     - Offer value: 431 (retained my side)\n     - Final offer: [1, 8, 1, 2, 4]\n\nNow formalizing the counteroffer in JSON format:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 8, 1, 2, 4]}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.
