Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 544. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 544. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 483 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 3, 3, 3, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    26 x 3 + 38 x 3 + 44 x 3 + 33 x 3 + 20 x 6\n    which is 543 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 544. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

This means I'm offering them 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n\nThis leaves me with 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5, with a total value to me of 573, which is better than my outside offer of 544.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 0, 2]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 127. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 525 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    26 x 0 + 15 x 0 + 31 x 0 + 61 x 0 + 42 x 3\n    which is 126 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 127. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 745. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 745. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 678 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 6, 0, 3, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    39 x 4 + 16 x 6 + 7 x 0 + 79 x 3 + 85 x 3\n    which is 744 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 745. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

I should try to keep most of items 4 and 5, and be more willing to give away item 3.\n\nLet me calculate a potential offer where I keep most high-value items:\n- If I offer Player 2: [2, 3, 3, 0, 0] (keeping [2, 3, 1, 3, 3] for myself)\n  - My value: (2\u00d739) + (3\u00d716) + (1\u00d77) + (3\u00d779) + (3\u00d785) = 78 + 48 + 7 + 237 + 255 = 625\n  - This is less than my outside offer (745), so not acceptable\n\n- If I offer Player 2: [2, 3, 4, 0, 0] (keeping [2, 3, 0, 3, 3] for myself)\n  - My value: (2\u00d739) + (3\u00d716) + (0\u00d77) + (3\u00d779) + (3\u00d785) = 78 + 48 + 0 + 237 + 255 = 618\n  - Even worse, still below outside offer\n\n- If I offer Player 2: [1, 2, 4, 0, 0] (keeping [3, 4, 0, 3, 3] for myself)\n  - My value: (3\u00d739) + (4\u00d716) + (0\u00d77) + (3\u00d779) + (3\u00d785) = 117 + 64 + 0 + 237 + 255 = 673\n  - Still below outside offer\n\n- If I offer Player 2: [0, 2, 4, 0, 0] (keeping [4, 4, 0, 3, 3] for myself)\n  - My value: (4\u00d739) + (4\u00d716) + (0\u00d77) + (3\u00d779) + (3\u00d785) = 156 + 64 + 0 + 237 + 255 = 712\n  - Still below outside offer\n\n- If I offer Player 2: [0, 1, 4, 0, 0] (keeping [4, 5, 0, 3, 3] for myself)\n  - My value: (4\u00d739) + (5\u00d716) + (0\u00d77) + (3\u00d779) + (3\u00d785) = 156 + 80 + 0 + 237 + 255 = 728\n  - Still below outside offer\n\n- If I offer Player 2: [0, 0, 4, 0, 0] (keeping [4, 6, 0, 3, 3] for myself)\n  - My value: (4\u00d739) + (6\u00d716) + (0\u00d77) + (3\u00d779) + (3\u00d785) = 156 + 96 + 0 + 237 + 255 = 744\n  - Still just below outside offer (745)\n\n- If I offer Player 2: [0, 0, 4, 0, 0] and keep just one item from item 3 (keeping [4, 6, 0, 3, 3]):\n  - My value: (4\u00d739) + (6\u00d716) + (0\u00d77) + (3\u00d779) + (3\u00d785) = 156 + 96 + 0 + 237 + 255 = 744\n  - Very close but still below my outside offer\n\n- If I offer Player 2: [0, 0, 3, 0, 0] (keeping [4, 6, 1, 3, 3] for myself)\n  - My value: (4\u00d739) + (6\u00d716) + (1\u00d77) + (3\u00d779) + (3\u00d785) = 156 + 96 + 7 + 237 + 255 = 751\n  - This exceeds my outside offer of 745\n\n## 3) Decision:\nI'll offer [0, 0, 3, 0, 0] to Player 2, keeping the more valuable items for myself. This gives me a value of 751, which is better than my outside offer of 745. I'm offering Player 2 3 units of item 3, which is my least valuable item.\n\nThis approach avoids all five potential mistakes:\n- Not making an offer worse than my outside offer (751 > 745)\n- Not offering nothing or everything\n- Not offering something that would be worse than previous offers (first offer)\n- Not accepting something worse than my outside offer (no acceptance yet)\n- Not walking away from something better than my outside offer (not walking)\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 3, 0, 0]}",

This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 6, 0, 3, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    39 x 4 + 16 x 6 + 7 x 0 + 79 x 3 + 85 x 3\n    which is 744 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 745. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 3, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 3, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 3, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

This means that accepting an offer in a later round is worth less than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [0, 4, 0, 3, 0]. This means I would receive:\n    *   Item 1: 7 - 0 = 7\n    *   Item 2: 6 - 4 = 2\n    *   Item 3: 3 - 0 = 3\n    *   Item 4: 4 - 3 = 1\n    *   Item 5: 3 - 0 = 3\n    My total value for the current offer would be: (7 * 97) + (2 * 7) + (3 * 64) + (1 * 83) + (3 * 33) = 679 + 14 + 192 + 83 + 99 = 1067\n    This is *much* better than my outside offer of 69.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to consider what I would give Player 1 to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I want to make sure I don't make Mistake 2 (offer worse than my outside offer). I also need to make sure I don't make Mistake 1 (offer worse than previous offer)\n\n    Let's consider a counteroffer where I give Player 1 a bit more of the items I value less, while keeping most of item 1 and item 4. For example, giving them [0, 2, 0, 1, 0].\n    If I offer [0, 2, 0, 1, 0], I keep:\n        *Item 1: 7\n        *Item 2: 4\n        *Item 3: 3\n        *Item 4: 3\n        *Item 5: 3\n    Value = 7 * 97 + 4 * 7 + 3 * 64 + 3 * 83 + 3 * 33 = 679 + 28 + 192 + 249 + 99 = 1247.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer gives me a value of 1067, which is far greater than my outside offer of 69. I could accept it, but I believe I can get a better deal. I will propose a counteroffer that is more favorable to me.\n\nI am going to offer [0, 2, 0, 1, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 0, 1, 0]}\n```",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 1049. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1049. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 828 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [6, 3, 3, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    78 x 6 + 25 x 3 + 100 x 3 + 7 x 1 + 66 x 3\n    which is 1048 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1049. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 680. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 519 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 3, 6, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    11 x 0 + 2 x 0 + 72 x 3 + 23 x 6 + 65 x 5\n    which is 679 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 680. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 1, 2, 1, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 1, 2, 1, 3]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and decide on my action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 680\n*   My values for the items: item 1 = 11, item 2 = 2, item 3 = 72, item 4 = 23, item 5 = 65\n*   Total pool of items: item 1 = 4, item 2 = 2, item 3 = 5, item 4 = 7, item 5 = 8\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   Current offer: Player 1 offers me [3, 1, 2, 1, 3]. This means I get:\n    *   Item 1: 3 units, value = 3 * 11 = 33\n    *   Item 2: 1 unit, value = 1 * 2 = 2\n    *   Item 3: 2 units, value = 2 * 72 = 144\n    *   Item 4: 1 unit, value = 1 * 23 = 23\n    *   Item 5: 3 units, value = 3 * 65 = 195\n    *   Total value of current offer: 33 + 2 + 144 + 23 + 195 = 397\n*   Compare to outside offer: 397 < 680. Accepting this offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider a counteroffer. I need to keep enough items to exceed my outside offer value of 680. I will start with keeping all item 3 and item 5.\n* Keeping 5 units of item 3 = 5 * 72 = 360\n* Keeping 8 units of item 5 = 8 * 65 = 520\n* Total is 880, which already exceeds my outside offer. I can consider giving away some of item 3 and item 5 or keeping nothing of other items.\n\nLet's see if I can make a counteroffer that gives player 1 a reasonable amount.\nI could propose keeping:\n* Item 1: 1\n* Item 2: 0\n* Item 3: 3\n* Item 4: 0\n* Item 5: 6\nMy offer to Player 1 would be [3, 2, 2, 7, 2]. My calculation would be\n1 x 11 + 0 x 2 + 3 x 72 + 0 x 23 + 6 x 65 = 11 + 216 + 390 = 617. This is lower than the outside offer, so it is not a good counteroffer.\n\nLet's consider a slightly better one for me:\n* Item 1: 0\n* Item 2: 0\n* Item 3: 4\n* Item 4: 0\n* Item 5: 5\nMy offer to Player 1 would be [4, 2, 1, 7, 3]. My calculation would be\n0 x 11 + 0 x 2 + 4 x 72 + 0 x 23 + 5 x 65 = 0 + 288 + 325 = 613. This is also lower than the outside offer, so it is not a good counteroffer.\n\nSince this is round 1, and I'm fairly certain Player 1 will make another offer, and accepting the current offer is worse than my outside option, I'll start with an aggressive counteroffer to see their reaction and try to secure more value for myself.\nLet's try:\n* Item 1: 0\n* Item 2: 0\n* Item 3: 5\n* Item 4: 0\n* Item 5: 8\n\nSo I offer [4, 2, 0, 7, 0] to player 1. My calculation of what I keep is:\n0 * 11 + 0 * 2 + 5 * 72 + 0 * 23 + 8 * 65 = 0 + 0 + 360 + 0 + 520 = 880. 880 > 680. This is a valid offer for me.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is worse than my outside offer. I will make a counteroffer that gives Player 1 [4, 2, 0, 7, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 2, 0, 7, 0]}\n```",

Since we are in round 2, accepting now means my value will be multiplied by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** Player 1 is offering me [3, 1, 1, 1, 2]. This means I would receive:\n    *   3 units of item 1 * 11 = 33\n    *   1 unit of item 2 * 2 = 2\n    *   1 unit of item 3 * 72 = 72\n    *   1 unit of item 4 * 23 = 23\n    *   2 units of item 5 * 65 = 130\n    *   Total Value = 33 + 2 + 72 + 23 + 130 = 260\n    *   Discounted Total Value = 260 * 0.9 = 234\n\n    This discounted value (234) is significantly less than my outside offer of 680.\n\n*   **Previous Offer:** Player 1 offered [3, 1, 2, 1, 3] in Round 1.

Meaning I keep:\n    * 0 units of item 1 * 11 = 0\n    * 0 units of item 2 * 2 = 0\n    * 5 units of item 3 * 72 = 360\n    * 0 units of item 4 * 23 = 0\n    * 8 units of item 5 * 65 = 520\n    *   Total Value = 0 + 0 + 360 + 0 + 520 = 880\n    *   Discounted Total Value = 880 * 0.9 = 792\n\n    This discounted value (792) is greater than my outside offer of 680.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to find an offer that gives me more than 680 / 0.9 = 755.56.

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 428. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 428. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 777 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 1, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    24 x 0 + 35 x 2 + 43 x 1 + 95 x 2 + 62 x 2\n    which is 427 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 428. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 1, 2, 1, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [4, 2, 0, 7, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [3, 1, 1, 1, 2]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "I need to carefully analyze this situation and make the best decision based on my objectives.\n\n## Step 1: Analyze the current situation\n\n- My outside offer value is 428\n- My item values are:\n  * Item 1: 24 per unit (4 units total)\n  * Item 2: 35 per unit (2 units total)\n  * Item 3: 43 per unit (5 units total)\n  * Item 4: 95 per unit (7 units total)\n  * Item 5: 62 per unit (8 units total)\n- Total pool: 4 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 7 units of item 4, 8 units of item 5\n- Discount factor: gamma = 0.9, and we're in round 3, so any deal will be discounted by 0.9^2 = 0.81\n\n## Step 2: Assess the value of offers\n\nCurrent offer: Player 2 is offering me [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], meaning they want all items, leaving me with nothing. This is worth 0 to me, which is worse than my outside offer of 428.\n\nLet me analyze our previous interactions:\n- I initially offered Player 2 [3, 1, 2, 1, 3], keeping [1, 1, 3, 6, 5] for myself\n- Player 2 countered with [4, 2, 0, 7, 0], keeping [0, 0, 5, 0, 8] for themselves\n- I then offered [3, 1, 1, 1, 2], keeping [1, 1, 4, 6, 6] for myself\n- Player 2 now offers [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], which means they want everything\n\nPlayer 2's latest offer is extremely aggressive. Their previous offer showed interest in items 1, 2, and 4, while keeping all of items 3 and 5 for me.\n\nLet me calculate the value of keeping everything for myself:\n- 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 24 = 96\n- 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 35 = 70\n- 5 units of item 3 = 5 \u00d7 43 = 215\n- 7 units of item 4 = 7 \u00d7 95 = 665\n- 8 units of item 5 = 8 \u00d7 62 = 496\n- Total value = 1,542\n\nWith the discount factor of 0.81 in round 3, this would be worth 1,542 \u00d7 0.81 = 1,249.02\n\n## Step 3: Make a decision\n\nSince this is the final round, I have two realistic options:\n1. Make a counteroffer that would be acceptable to Player 2\n2. Walk away and take my outside offer of 428\n\nPlayer 2's behavior suggests they might be difficult to deal with. Their last offer of [0,0,0,0,0] is completely unreasonable and would give me nothing.\n\nI could make a final counteroffer showing a willingness to compromise, but I need to ensure it's better than my outside offer. Let me try a fair division that acknowledges Player 2's apparent interest in items 1, 2, and 4:\n\nIf I offer [2, 1, 1, 3, 2], I keep [2, 1, 4, 4, 6]:\n- 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 24 = 48\n- 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 35 = 35\n- 4 units of item 3 = 4 \u00d7 43 = 172\n- 4 units of item 4 = 4 \u00d7 95 = 380\n- 6 units of item 5 = 6 \u00d7 62 = 372\n- Total value = 1,007\n\nWith discount factor: 1,007 \u00d7 0.81 = 815.67, which is better than my outside offer of 428.\n\nHowever, given Player 2's aggressive final offer and the fact that we're in the last round, I believe they might be unwilling to compromise. In this case, making a counteroffer would be equivalent to walking away.\n\nSince my best counteroffer (815.67) is significantly better than my outside offer (428), I'll make this final attempt at reaching an agreement.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 1, 3, 2]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 381. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 750 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 1, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    6 x 0 + 98 x 1 + 10 x 1 + 47 x 2 + 89 x 2\n    which is 380 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 381. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 714. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 744 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 2, 5, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party.

This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 3 - 2 = 1 unit\n    *   Item 2: 2 - 0 = 2 units\n    *   Item 3: 7 - 6 = 1 unit\n    *   Item 4: 4 - 1 = 3 units\n    *   Item 5: 2 - 0 = 2 units\n    My value for this offer is: (1 * 40) + (2 * 31) + (1 * 87) + (3 * 22) + (2 * 68) = 40 + 62 + 87 + 66 + 136 = 391\n\n    Since 391 < 714, accepting the current offer is worse than my outside offer.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find an offer that gives me a value greater than 714. Let's start by calculating my total possible value:\n    (3 * 40) + (2 * 31) + (7 * 87) + (4 * 22) + (2 * 68) = 120 + 62 + 609 + 88 + 136 = 1015\n\n    Let's consider a counteroffer where I give Player 1 very little.

I need to give them something.\n\n    Let's try an offer where I give Player 1: [1, 1, 2, 2, 1]. This means I keep:\n    * Item 1: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n    * Item 2: 2 - 1 = 1 unit\n    * Item 3: 7 - 2 = 5 units\n    * Item 4: 4 - 2 = 2 units\n    * Item 5: 2 - 1 = 1 unit\n    My value for this is: (2 * 40) + (1 * 31) + (5 * 87) + (2 * 22) + (1 * 68) = 80 + 31 + 435 + 44 + 68 = 658. This is still less than my outside offer.\n\n    Let's try an offer where I give Player 1: [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]. This means I keep:\n    * Item 1: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n    * Item 2: 2 - 0 = 2 units\n    * Item 3: 7 - 1 = 6 units\n    * Item 4: 4 - 1 = 3 units\n    * Item 5: 2 - 0 = 2 units\n    My value for this is: (2 * 40) + (2 * 31) + (6 * 87) + (3 * 22) + (2 * 68) = 80 + 62 + 522 + 66 + 136 = 866.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 2, 5, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    40 x 2 + 31 x 2 + 87 x 5 + 22 x 0 + 68 x 2\n    which is 713 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 714. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 328. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 870 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 1, 5, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    11 x 1 + 86 x 0 + 44 x 1 + 54 x 5 + 95 x 0\n    which is 325 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 328. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best course of action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 328\n*   Item values: Item 1 = 11, Item 2 = 86, Item 3 = 44, Item 4 = 54, Item 5 = 95\n*   Total item pool: 1 unit of Item 1, 3 units of Item 2, 1 unit of Item 3, 9 units of Item 4, 4 units of Item 5\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]. This means I get 0 units of Item 1, 0 units of Item 2, 0 units of Item 3, 1 unit of Item 4, and 0 units of Item 5. My value is (0 * 11) + (0 * 86) + (0 * 44) + (1 * 54) + (0 * 95) = 54.\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer value (54) is much less than my outside offer (328).\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find an offer that gives me a value greater than 328.\n\n3) **Develop a Counteroffer:**\n\nI need to keep items that are valuable to me. Item 5 (value 95) and Item 2 (value 86) are the most valuable. Let's try to keep all the items 5 and some of item 2.\nLet's consider giving Player 1 the following: [1, 0, 1, 9, 0].\nThis means I keep: [0, 3, 0, 0, 4]\nMy value = 0 * 11 + 3 * 86 + 0 * 44 + 0 * 54 + 4 * 95 = 258 + 380 = 638. This is greater than my outside offer of 328.\nThis would be a valid counteroffer.\n\nLet's also test if giving up fewer items in the other categories might be better. If I gave Player 1 [1, 1, 1, 9, 0], then my total value would be\n0 * 11 + 2 * 86 + 0 * 44 + 0 * 54 + 4 * 95 = 172 + 380 = 552, which is also greater than my outside offer.\n\nLet's try giving Player 1 [1, 3, 1, 9, 0]:\nThen I keep [0, 0, 0, 0, 4].\nThis would result in a total value of 4 * 95 = 380.\n\nLet's offer Player 1 the minimum possible while being better than my outside offer. I must keep at least 328 / 95 = 3.45 units of item 5 to be profitable. Therefore I should keep all 4 units.\nThen I can give player 1 [1, 3, 1, 9, 0]. My value would be 4 * 95 = 380.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nSince the current offer is significantly worse than my outside offer, I should make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 3, 1, 9, 0]}\n```",

I should keep most of the high-value items for myself while offering enough to make it potentially attractive to Player 2.\n\nMy highest value items are:\n1. Item 1 (94 per unit)\n2. Item 2 (84 per unit)\n3. Item 3 (78 per unit)\n4. Item 5 (75 per unit)\n5. Item 4 (53 per unit)\n\nLet me try to construct an offer where I keep most high-value items for myself:\n- If I offer [0,0,0,1,1] to Player 2 (keeping [3,3,2,2,5] for myself):\n  My value = 3\u00d794 + 3\u00d784 + 2\u00d778 + 2\u00d753 + 5\u00d775 = 282 + 252 + 156 + 106 + 375 = 1171\n  This is well above my outside offer of 759.\n\n- Let me try being a bit more generous while still maintaining good value:\n  If I offer [0,1,0,2,2] to Player 2 (keeping [3,2,2,1,4] for myself):\n  My value = 3\u00d794 + 2\u00d784 + 2\u00d778 + 1\u00d753 + 4\u00d775 = 282 + 168 + 156 + 53 + 300 = 959\n  This is still well above my outside offer.\n\nLet me try one more case that's slightly more balanced while prioritizing my highest-value items:\n- If I offer [1,1,0,2,3] to Player 2 (keeping [2,2,2,1,3] for myself):\n  My value = 2\u00d794 + 2\u00d784 + 2\u00d778 + 1\u00d753 + 3\u00d775 = 188 + 168 + 156 + 53 + 225 = 790\n  This still exceeds my outside offer of 759.\n\nSince I want to keep my high-value items (especially items 1, 2, 3) while making a reasonable offer, I'll go with the [1,1,0,2,3] offer. This allows me to retain most of my valuable items while giving Player 2 a credible opening offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1,1,0,2,3]}",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 1, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    77 x 0 + 49 x 0 + 88 x 1 + 93 x 1 + 69 x 6\n    which is 595 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 596. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 0, 1, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 0, 1, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step to determine the best action.\n\n1.  **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n    *   My outside offer value: 596\n    *   My item values: item 1 = 77, item 2 = 49, item 3 = 88, item 4 = 93, item 5 = 69\n    *   Total items: 3 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 4 of item 4, 6 of item 5\n    *   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means that accepting an offer later is worth less than accepting it now.\n\n2.  **Assess the value of the current offer:**\n\n    *   Current offer: [3, 0, 1, 1, 2] (items offered to me)\n    *   My holdings if I accept: 3 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 1 of item 4 and 2 of item 5.\n    *   Value to me if I accept: (3 * 77) + (0 * 49) + (1 * 88) + (1 * 93) + (2 * 69) = 231 + 0 + 88 + 93 + 138 = 550\n\n    *   Comparison: 550 < 596 (my outside offer). Accepting the current offer would be worse than walking away. This would be Mistake 4.\n\n3.  **Consider potential counteroffers:**\n\n    I need to find an offer (what I give to Player 1) that leaves me with a value greater than 596. My total possible value is 1467.\n\n    Let's consider some strategies:\n\n    *   **Equal division (approximately):** This would mean giving Player 1 roughly half of the items. A potential offer would be something like [1, 1, 2, 2, 3].\n        *   My holdings: [2, 1, 2, 2, 3].\n        *   Value to me: (2 * 77) + (1 * 49) + (2 * 88) + (2 * 93) + (3 * 69) = 154 + 49 + 176 + 186 + 207 = 772\n        *   Comparison: 772 > 596. This is a better outcome than my outside offer.\n\n    *   **Trying to get as much as possible:** This could mean offering a minimal amount to Player 1. However, this might be rejected, and the discount factor will reduce my value in future rounds.\n\n    Given that it's round 1 and I have a reasonable margin for negotiation, I will make a counteroffer that is better than my outside option.\n\n    **Let's refine the counteroffer to offer just enough to be better than my outside option, without being too generous**:\n\n    If I offer [2, 1, 3, 3, 5] to player 1, that leaves me with [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. The value to me is (1*77) + (1*49) + (1*88) + (1*93) + (1*69) = 376. This is too low.\n\n    Let's try offering player 1 [2, 0, 2, 2, 4]. This leaves me with [1, 2, 2, 2, 2]. The value to me is (1*77) + (2*49) + (2*88) + (2*93) + (2*69) = 77 + 98 + 176 + 186 + 138 = 675. This is greater than 596.\n\n4.  **Decision:**\n\n    Since the current offer is worse than my outside offer, I will make a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 2, 2, 4]}\n```",

Let the offer to Player 1 be [x1, x2, x3, x4, x5].\nThen I keep [3-x1, 2-x2, 4-x3, 4-x4, 6-x5].\nMy value would be (3-x1)*77 + (2-x2)*49 + (4-x3)*88 + (4-x4)*93 + (6-x5)*69 and this needs to be greater than 596/0.9 = 662.22.\n\nLet's try to offer the other player what they offered me in round 1: [3, 0, 1, 1, 2]\nThen I would keep [0, 2, 3, 3, 4].\nMy value would be (0 * 77) + (2 * 49) + (3 * 88) + (3 * 93) + (4 * 69) = 0 + 98 + 264 + 279 + 276 = 917\nDiscounted Value = 917 * 0.9 = 825.3 which is greater than 596. This looks promising.\n\nLet's examine an offer closer to my outside offer. Consider giving away:\n[1, 1, 1, 1, 4]\nI keep: [2, 1, 3, 3, 2]\nValue: (2 * 77) + (1 * 49) + (3 * 88) + (3 * 93) + (2 * 69) = 154 + 49 + 264 + 279 + 138 = 884\nDiscounted Value = 884 * 0.9 = 795.6\n\nConsider giving away:\n[2, 1, 2, 2, 4]\nI keep: [1, 1, 2, 2, 2]\nValue: (1 * 77) + (1 * 49) + (2 * 88) + (2 * 93) + (2 * 69) = 77 + 49 + 176 + 186 + 138 = 626\nDiscounted Value = 626 * 0.9 = 563.4 Which is LESS than 596\n\nI will try giving [2, 0, 2, 2, 3].\nI keep: [1, 2, 2, 2, 3]\nValue: (1 * 77) + (2 * 49) + (2 * 88) + (2 * 93) + (3 * 69) = 77 + 98 + 176 + 186 + 207 = 744\nDiscounted Value: 744 * 0.9 = 669.6\n\nThis value is good enough.\n\n5) **Decision:**\n\nSince the current offer gives me a value less than my outside offer, and I found a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than my outside offer (taking into account the discount factor), I will make that counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 2, 2, 3]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    61 x 0 + 85 x 0 + 26 x 1 + 10 x 1 + 59 x 0\n    which is 36 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 37. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 1, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 0, 1, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

This is less than my outside offer.\n\nLet's try offering [0, 0, 1, 0, 0] to Player 1, meaning I keep [2, 4, 2, 1, 4].\nMy value is: 2*32 + 4*18 + 2*22 + 1*97 + 4*31 = 64 + 72 + 44 + 97 + 124 = 401. This is less than my outside offer.\n\nI need to get more value out of this deal. Giving up too much of the higher value items (like Item 4) makes the deal unattractive.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer is terrible. My outside offer is 418. My initial assessment of keeping everything results in a total value of 423. I want to capture some of that value. I will make a counteroffer, giving the other player a small amount, while ensuring I get a value higher than my outside offer. I think I'll try to take a bit more for myself.\n\nCounteroffer: [1, 2, 1, 0, 2] results in a total value of 271.\n[0, 1, 0, 0, 0] to Player 1, meaning I keep [2, 3, 3, 1, 4]. My value is 405\n[0, 0, 1, 0, 0] to Player 1, meaning I keep [2, 4, 2, 1, 4]. My value is 401\n[0, 0, 0, 1, 0] to Player 1, meaning I keep [2, 4, 3, 0, 4]. My value is 64 + 72 + 66 + 0 + 124 = 326.\n\nI think I will offer player 1 [0,0,0,0,0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 427. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 849 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 2, 0, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    35 x 0 + 72 x 2 + 47 x 2 + 82 x 0 + 47 x 4\n    which is 426 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 427. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

The discount factor influences the value of accepting offers now versus waiting for future offers. Accepting an offer in later rounds means the value is discounted by gamma^(r-1).\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 1, 1, 0, 1].  This means I would receive 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.  My value would be:\n      (1 * 32) + (1 * 18) + (1 * 22) + (0 * 97) + (1 * 31) = 32 + 18 + 22 + 0 + 31 = 103\n      Since this is round 2, the discounted value of accepting this offer is 103 * (0.9^(2-1)) = 103 * 0.9 = 92.7\n      This is significantly less than my outside offer of 418.\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find a division where my value is greater than 418. Let's calculate what I would keep from the original amounts.\n      Item 1 = 2, Item 2 = 4, Item 3 = 3, Item 4 = 1, Item 5 = 4\n      Current amounts to Player 1: Item 1 = 1, Item 2 = 1, Item 3 = 1, Item 4 = 0, Item 5 = 1\n      Amounts I keep: Item 1 = 1, Item 2 = 3, Item 3 = 2, Item 4 = 1, Item 5 = 3\n      Value I keep: (1 * 32) + (3 * 18) + (2 * 22) + (1 * 97) + (3 * 31) = 32 + 54 + 44 + 97 + 93 = 320\n      This is much lower than my outside offer, let's look for another offer.\n      Let's try offering [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]. This would mean I keep [2, 3, 3, 1, 4].\n      Value I keep: (2 * 32) + (3 * 18) + (3 * 22) + (1 * 97) + (4 * 31) = 64 + 54 + 66 + 97 + 124 = 405\n      This is still lower than my outside offer.\n      How about offering [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]?\n      Value I keep: (2 * 32) + (4 * 18) + (3 * 22) + (1 * 97) + (4 * 31) = 64 + 72 + 66 + 97 + 124 = 423\n      423 * 0.9 = 380.7, which is less than 418.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   - Accepting the current offer yields a discounted value of 92.7, which is much less than my outside offer of 418. This is Mistake 4.\n   - A counteroffer that yields a value of 423 gives 380.7 discounted, which is still lower.\n\n   Since we're in round 2, making a counteroffer with a total value of 423 would yield 380.7 to me (423 * 0.9), which is below my outside offer of 418. Therefore, walking away now is better than making any counteroffer. There is no offer that I can provide that is better than my outside offer when discounted.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 4, 2, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    38 x 0 + 7 x 2 + 78 x 4 + 84 x 2 + 4 x 1\n    which is 498 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 499. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This means that a deal in round 2 is worth 90% of a deal in round 1, and a deal in round 3 is worth 81% of a deal in round 1.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** Player 1 is offering me [2, 4, 0, 0, 6]. This means I would receive:\n    *   2 units of item 1: 2 * 79 = 158\n    *   4 units of item 2: 4 * 28 = 112\n    *   0 units of item 3: 0 * 55 = 0\n    *   0 units of item 4: 0 * 83 = 0\n    *   6 units of item 5: 6 * 1 = 6\n    *   Total value of current offer: 158 + 112 + 0 + 0 + 6 = 276\n\n*   **Comparison to Outside Offer:** The current offer's value (276) is significantly higher than my outside offer (148). Therefore, accepting this offer is better than walking away right now.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** Before I accept, let's consider if I can get even more value.\n    *If I offer nothing (giving all items to Player 1): Value = 0, which is much worse than outside offer. Mistake #3.\n    *If I ask for everything: Value = 6*79 + 5*28 + 4*55 + 2*83 + 7*1 = 474 + 140 + 220 + 166 + 7 = 1007.\n    Let's try to get 3 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 1 of item 4 and 4 of item 5.\n\n3*79 + 3*28 + 2*55 + 1*83 + 4*1 = 237 + 84 + 110 + 83 + 4 = 518.

Counteroffer: [3, 2, 2, 1, 3]\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer (276) is better than my outside offer (148).\n*   I believe I can get more value by making a counteroffer.\n\nTherefore, I will make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 2, 2, 1, 3]}\n```",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 148. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 148. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 738 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 5, 0, 0, 7] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    79 x 0 + 28 x 5 + 55 x 0 + 83 x 0 + 1 x 7\n    which is 147 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 148. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 4, 0, 0, 6]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 2, 2, 1, 3]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [3, 3, 0, 0, 6]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 3, 0, 0, 6]\n\n    What is your action?

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 1, 3, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    47 x 0 + 34 x 2 + 69 x 1 + 8 x 3 + 64 x 3\n    which is 353 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 354. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

This means an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its value in round 1, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 0.9^2 times its value in round 1.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer:** I am being offered [1, 2, 0, 3, 2]. This means Player 1 keeps:\n      - Item 1: 4 - 1 = 3 units\n      - Item 2: 3 - 2 = 1 unit\n      - Item 3: 1 - 0 = 1 unit\n      - Item 4: 4 - 3 = 1 unit\n      - Item 5: 6 - 2 = 4 units\n      My value if I accept the current offer is:\n      (1 * 25) + (2 * 12) + (0 * 5) + (3 * 74) + (2 * 35) = 25 + 24 + 0 + 222 + 70 = 341\n      Since 341 > 169, accepting the current offer is better than walking away *right now*.\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find an offer that is better for me than my outside offer. It is round 1, so there are still 2 rounds to go. Discounting the future is important, but there is a lot of value in play, so perhaps a counteroffer is worthwhile.\n    I need to keep in mind the five mistakes I could be making.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 5, 2, 4, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    91 x 0 + 9 x 5 + 98 x 2 + 68 x 4 + 61 x 3\n    which is 696 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 697.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 697. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 981 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 5, 2, 4, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    91 x 0 + 9 x 5 + 98 x 2 + 68 x 4 + 61 x 3\n    which is 696 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 697. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 4, 0, 1, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 3, 1, 1, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 3, 1, 1, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

This means accepting an offer in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its actual value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 4, 0, 1, 3]. This means I keep:\n      - Item 1: 5 - 1 = 4 units\n      - Item 2: 5 - 4 = 1 unit\n      - Item 3: 2 - 0 = 2 units\n      - Item 4: 4 - 1 = 3 units\n      - Item 5: 6 - 3 = 3 units\n   - Value of current offer to me:\n      - (4 * 83) + (1 * 69) + (2 * 65) + (3 * 98) + (3 * 1) = 332 + 69 + 130 + 294 + 3 = 828\n   - Discounted value of current offer: 828 * 0.9 = 745.2\n   - Since 745.2 is greater than my outside offer of 619, accepting is better than walking away *right now*.\n\n3) **Consider a counteroffer:** I need to determine if a counteroffer could yield a higher discounted value *after* considering the likelihood of it being accepted. Given we're in round 2, it might be beneficial to propose a slightly more aggressive counteroffer to try to get a better deal. However, I don't want to risk walking away with nothing.\n\nLet's evaluate Player 1's initial offer to me in round 1 : [1, 4, 0, 1, 3] and Player 2's counteroffer in round 1 which was [1, 3, 1, 1, 3] (offered to Player 1):\n\nIf I offer [1, 3, 1, 1, 3] to Player 1 again, then I am keeping:\n      - Item 1: 5 - 1 = 4 units\n      - Item 2: 5 - 3 = 2 units\n      - Item 3: 2 - 1 = 1 units\n      - Item 4: 4 - 1 = 3 units\n      - Item 5: 6 - 3 = 3 units\nValue of keeping these items:\n(4 * 83) + (2 * 69) + (1 * 65) + (3 * 98) + (3 * 1) = 332 + 138 + 65 + 294 + 3 = 832\n\nDiscounted value of keeping these items: 832 * 0.9 = 748.8 which is greater than the discounted value of accepting player 1's current offer of 745.2 and which is higher than my outside offer of 619.\n\nSince 748.8 > 745.2 (the discounted value of accepting the current offer), offering player 1 the same offer as I did last round could potentially get me an even better deal.\n\nTherefore, I will make a counteroffer identical to the one I made in Round 1.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 3, 1, 1, 3]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1179. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 924 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 4, 10, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    13 x 0 + 82 x 2 + 69 x 4 + 66 x 10 + 78 x 1\n    which is 1178 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1179. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 2, 2, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    30 x 1 + 46 x 1 + 4 x 2 + 92 x 2 + 11 x 4\n    which is 312 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 313. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "I need to analyze the situation and make a strategic offer as the first player in this negotiation.\n\n## Step 1: Analyzing my situation\n\n- My outside offer value: 313\n- My item values:\n  - Item 1: 30 per unit (6 units total = 180 value)\n  - Item 2: 46 per unit (8 units total = 368 value)\n  - Item 3: 4 per unit (2 units total = 8 value)\n  - Item 4: 92 per unit (2 units total = 184 value)\n  - Item 5: 11 per unit (7 units total = 77 value)\n- Total items value to me: 817\n- Discount factor: 0.9 (meaning future rounds are worth less)\n\n## Step 2: Assessing potential offers\n\nSince I'm making the first offer, I should try to keep items of high value to me and offer the other player items that are likely less valuable to me. I should particularly keep item 4 (highest value per unit at 92) and most of item 2 (second highest at 46).\n\nLet me consider an initial offer where I offer Player 2:\n- 3 units of item 1 (30 \u00d7 3 = 90 value to me)\n- 2 units of item 2 (46 \u00d7 2 = 92 value to me)\n- 2 units of item 3 (4 \u00d7 2 = 8 value to me)\n- 0 units of item 4 (92 \u00d7 0 = 0 value to me)\n- 5 units of item 5 (11 \u00d7 5 = 55 value to me)\n\nTotal value I'm offering: 90 + 92 + 8 + 0 + 55 = 245\n\nThis means I keep:\n- 3 units of item 1 (30 \u00d7 3 = 90 value)\n- 6 units of item 2 (46 \u00d7 6 = 276 value)\n- 0 units of item 3 (4 \u00d7 0 = 0 value)\n- 2 units of item 4 (92 \u00d7 2 = 184 value)\n- 2 units of item 5 (11 \u00d7 2 = 22 value)\n\nTotal value I keep: 90 + 276 + 0 + 184 + 22 = 572\n\n## Step 3: Decision making\n\nMy offer keeps me 572 value which is significantly better than my outside offer of 313. I've kept the most valuable items (4 and 2) mostly for myself but offered a reasonable split to appear fair.\n\nThis offer gives me about 70% of the total value (572/817), which is a strong starting position but not so aggressive that Player 2 would immediately walk away. I'm offering Player 2 a mix of all item types except for item 4 (my most valuable).\n\nI believe this is a good initial offer that avoids all five potential mistakes:\n- It's my first offer, so it can't be worse than a previous offer\n- The value I keep (572) is much better than my outside offer (313)\n- I'm not offering nothing or everything\n- It's not an accept decision\n- It's not a walk decision\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 2, 2, 0, 5]}",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis.

This means accepting an offer later is worth less than accepting it now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [3, 2, 2, 0, 5]. This means I get:\n    *   3 units of item 1\n    *   2 units of item 2\n    *   2 units of item 3\n    *   0 units of item 4\n    *   5 units of item 5\n    My value for this offer is: (3 * 93) + (2 * 19) + (2 * 57) + (0 * 56) + (5 * 89) = 279 + 38 + 114 + 0 + 445 = 876\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** 876 < 1495. The current offer is much worse than my outside offer.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to create an offer that gives Player 1 some items while leaving me with a value greater than 1495. Let's consider a few scenarios:\n\n    *   **Scenario 1: I keep everything:** My total value is (6 * 93) + (8 * 19) + (2 * 57) + (2 * 56) + (7 * 89) = 558 + 152 + 114 + 112 + 623 = 1559\n    *   **Scenario 2: Give Player 1 almost everything:** This is a bad idea as my outside offer is high\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer (876) is worse than my outside offer (1495).\n*   Accepting the current offer is Mistake 4.\n*   I should not accept.\n*   If I walk away, I get 1495.\n*   I need to make a counteroffer that benefits me more than 1495.

This means I keep everything, which is worth 1559. This is better than my outside option of 1495.\nHowever, offering nothing is Mistake 3 and is considered suboptimal.\n\nLet's try offering player 1 only 1 unit of item 5, the least I can offer. This means I keep [6, 8, 2, 2, 6]. The total value to me is:\n(6 * 93) + (8 * 19) + (2 * 57) + (2 * 56) + (6 * 89) = 558 + 152 + 114 + 112 + 534 = 1470, which is lower than my outside offer.\n\nLet's try offering Player 1 one unit of item 2.

The total value to me is:\n(6 * 93) + (7 * 19) + (2 * 57) + (1 * 56) + (7 * 89) = 558 + 133 + 114 + 56 + 623 = 1484, still less than my outside offer.\n\nI need to offer enough to be acceptable to Player 1.\nHow about I give Player 1 all of item 3, all of item 4, and some of the others.\n\nLet's offer [1, 1, 2, 2, 1]\nThen I get [5, 7, 0, 0, 6]\nValue: (5 * 93) + (7 * 19) + (0 * 57) + (0 * 56) + (6 * 89) = 465 + 133 + 0 + 0 + 534 = 1132, still too low.\n\nLet's try [2, 3, 2, 2, 2]\nThen I get [4, 5, 0, 0, 5]\nValue: (4 * 93) + (5 * 19) + (0 * 57) + (0 * 56) + (5 * 89) = 372 + 95 + 0 + 0 + 445 = 912, still bad.\n\nLet's go back to offering [1, 1, 0, 0, 0] to Player 1. Then I keep [5, 7, 2, 2, 7]. The total value to me is:\n(5 * 93) + (7 * 19) + (2 * 57) + (2 * 56) + (7 * 89) = 465 + 133 + 114 + 112 + 623 = 1447, still not good enough.\n\nLet me offer [0, 0, 1, 1, 0] to Player 1.\nThen I get [6, 8, 1, 1, 7]. The total value to me is:\n(6 * 93) + (8 * 19) + (1 * 57) + (1 * 56) + (7 * 89) = 558 + 152 + 57 + 56 + 623 = 1446\n\nLet me offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 1] to Player 1.\nThen I get [6, 8, 2, 2, 6].

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 1436. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1436. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 915 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 3, 7, 5, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    92 x 5 + 80 x 3 + 53 x 7 + 71 x 5 + 9 x 1\n    which is 1435 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1436. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1436. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 915 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 3, 7, 5, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    92 x 5 + 80 x 3 + 53 x 7 + 71 x 5 + 9 x 1\n    which is 1435 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1436. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 5, 3, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 4]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 5, 4, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 5, 4, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [8, 2, 3, 5, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    16 x 8 + 14 x 2 + 18 x 3 + 31 x 5 + 65 x 3\n    which is 560 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 563. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

This means accepting an offer in a later round is worth less than accepting it now.\n\n2)  **Assess the value of offers:**\n    *   Current offer to me: [1, 1, 0, 0, 0].  This means I receive 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 of item 3, 0 of item 4, and 0 of item 5.\n        *   Value of accepting: 1 * 96 + 1 * 95 + 0 * 31 + 0 * 88 + 0 * 22 = 191.

Let's try another to ensure its not too good.\n\n        *   **Scenario 3: Give away a little more:**\n        Give 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 of item 3, 0 of item 4, 0 of item 5, and keep the rest.\n              *   My value: (6 * 96) + (4 * 95) + (3 * 31) + (5 * 88) + (3 * 22) = 576 + 380 + 93 + 440 + 66 = 1555\n\n3)  **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n    *   The current offer is terrible.\n    *   Scenario 1 has a terrible payoff.\n    *   Scenario 2 seems OK, since the value is above the outside offer. But, if I accept the current offer, I know that I am leaving a lot of value on the table. This is more of a \"take it or leave it\" kind of negotiation.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 316. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 642 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 1, 3, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    22 x 0 + 10 x 3 + 81 x 1 + 2 x 3 + 99 x 2\n    which is 315 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 316. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    41 x 0 + 67 x 0 + 40 x 0 + 47 x 1 + 43 x 1\n    which is 90 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 94. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 3, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 3, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and decide on the best action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 842\n*   **My item values:** item 1 = 22, item 2 = 71, item 3 = 51, item 4 = 60, item 5 = 6\n*   **Total items:** item 1 = 3, item 2 = 4, item 3 = 5, item 4 = 5, item 5 = 4\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its face value, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 0.81 times its face value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [1, 1, 3, 1, 1]. This means I keep:\n    *   item 1: 3 - 1 = 2\n    *   item 2: 4 - 1 = 3\n    *   item 3: 5 - 3 = 2\n    *   item 4: 5 - 1 = 4\n    *   item 5: 4 - 1 = 3\n    My value for this offer is: (2 * 22) + (3 * 71) + (2 * 51) + (4 * 60) + (3 * 6) = 44 + 213 + 102 + 240 + 18 = 617. This is less than my outside offer of 842.\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 842, or close enough that the discounted value in later rounds might be appealing.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is worth 617 to me, which is significantly less than my outside offer of 842. Accepting it would be Mistake 4.\n\nLet's try to construct a counteroffer where I keep most of the valuable items and give away the less valuable ones. I want to keep my value above 842. It's Round 1 so the discount is not yet significant.\n\nI will attempt to calculate a good counter offer. I will offer player 1 a minimal amount of my most valuable items, but more of the less valuable ones.\nLet's try offering [2, 3, 1, 2, 2] to Player 1. This means I keep:\n*   item 1: 3 - 2 = 1\n*   item 2: 4 - 3 = 1\n*   item 3: 5 - 1 = 4\n*   item 4: 5 - 2 = 3\n*   item 5: 4 - 2 = 2\nMy value for this is: (1 * 22) + (1 * 71) + (4 * 51) + (3 * 60) + (2 * 6) = 22 + 71 + 204 + 180 + 12 = 489. This is not greater than 842, so I can do better.\n\nLet's try another counteroffer: Offer [0, 0, 1, 0, 0].\nThis means I keep:\n* item 1: 3\n* item 2: 4\n* item 3: 4\n* item 4: 5\n* item 5: 4\nMy value = (3 * 22) + (4 * 71) + (4 * 51) + (5 * 60) + (4 * 6) = 66 + 284 + 204 + 300 + 24 = 878. This is greater than my outside offer, so this is a reasonable first counteroffer.\n\n**Decision:** I will make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]}\n```",

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 3, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 3, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 3, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 842.\n   - My item values are: item 1 = 22, item 2 = 71, item 3 = 51, item 4 = 60, item 5 = 6.\n   - The total pool of items is: 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor is 0.9. This means that accepting an offer in a later round is worth less than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer: I am offered [2, 1, 3, 1, 1]. This means Player 1 is offering me 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n   - Value of current offer:\n      - 2 * 22 + 1 * 71 + 3 * 51 + 1 * 60 + 1 * 6 = 44 + 71 + 153 + 60 + 6 = 334\n   - Comparison to outside offer: 334 < 842. Accepting the current offer is worse than my outside offer.\n\n   - Potential counteroffers: I need to find an offer that is greater than 842 after keeping what's left for myself. The current offer to me is [2, 1, 3, 1, 1], so that means I would keep [3-2, 4-1, 5-3, 5-1, 4-1] which is [1, 3, 2, 4, 3]. This is worth 1 * 22 + 3 * 71 + 2 * 51 + 4 * 60 + 3 * 6 = 22 + 213 + 102 + 240 + 18 = 595.  This is less than the outside offer.\n   - I should try to make a counteroffer that gives more to me. I want to find something > 842.\n\n   - Let's try giving Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Then I keep [3, 4, 5, 5, 4]. This is worth 3 * 22 + 4 * 71 + 5 * 51 + 5 * 60 + 4 * 6 = 66 + 284 + 255 + 300 + 24 = 929. This is better than the outside offer.\n\n   - Let's try giving Player 1 [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Then I keep [2, 4, 5, 5, 4]. This is worth 2 * 22 + 4 * 71 + 5 * 51 + 5 * 60 + 4 * 6 = 44 + 284 + 255 + 300 + 24 = 907. This is better than the outside offer.\n\n   - Let's try giving Player 1 [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]. Then I keep [3, 3, 5, 5, 4]. This is worth 3 * 22 + 3 * 71 + 5 * 51 + 5 * 60 + 4 * 6 = 66 + 213 + 255 + 300 + 24 = 858. This is better than the outside offer.\n   - Let's try giving Player 1 [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]. Then I keep [3, 4, 4, 5, 4]. This is worth 3 * 22 + 4 * 71 + 4 * 51 + 5 * 60 + 4 * 6 = 66 + 284 + 204 + 300 + 24 = 878. This is better than the outside offer.\n   - Let's try giving Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]. Then I keep [3, 4, 5, 4, 4]. This is worth 3 * 22 + 4 * 71 + 5 * 51 + 4 * 60 + 4 * 6 = 66 + 284 + 255 + 240 + 24 = 869. This is better than the outside offer.\n   - Let's try giving Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]. Then I keep [3, 4, 5, 5, 3]. This is worth 3 * 22 + 4 * 71 + 5 * 51 + 5 * 60 + 3 * 6 = 66 + 284 + 255 + 300 + 18 = 923. This is better than the outside offer.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - Accepting the current offer gives me 334, which is much worse than my outside offer of 842.\n   - Walking away gives me 842.\n   - Making a counteroffer can give me more than 842.\n\nGiven that I have only one round left and the other player is only offering 334, I should make a final counteroffer that is much more favorable to me, or else I should walk away. Let's make a counteroffer of giving the other player [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Then I keep [2, 4, 5, 5, 4]. This is worth 907. I think this is a reasonable counteroffer to make.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

                    "prompt": "\n    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\n    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\n    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\n    There are 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\n    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\n    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 101.\n    Your private values are 10 for item 1, 80 for item 2, 29 for item 3, 84 for item 4, 91 for item 5.\n    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to your total value of all items, which is 1279. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 815. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 815. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 882 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 3, 4, 1, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    10 x 1 + 80 x 3 + 29 x 4 + 84 x 1 + 91 x 4\n    which is 814 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 815. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 3, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 3, 1, 1]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?
