Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 144. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 144. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 675 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 0, 2, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    92 x 0 + 7 x 2 + 47 x 0 + 64 x 2 + 15 x 0\n    which is 142 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 144. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best course of action for Round 1.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** 144\n*   **Item values:** Item 1: 92, Item 2: 7, Item 3: 47, Item 4: 64, Item 5: 15\n*   **Total item pool:** Item 1: 5, Item 2: 4, Item 3: 2, Item 4: 4, Item 5: 0\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in a later round is worth less to me.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider different divisions of items and their value to me. I want to keep as much of the high-value items (1 and 4) as possible.\n\n3) **Develop a strategy:**\n\nSince this is Round 1 and there is no offer on the table, I should make an initial counteroffer that is favorable to me but also potentially acceptable to the other player. My goal is to secure a good deal early on and avoid the discounting effect of later rounds.\n\nLet's explore a few potential counteroffers:\n\n*   **Offer 1: Give Player 2 half of everything (rounded down where necessary)**\n    *   Give [2, 2, 1, 2, 0] to Player 2\n    *   Keep [3, 2, 1, 2, 0]\n    *   My value: (3 * 92) + (2 * 7) + (1 * 47) + (2 * 64) + (0 * 15) = 276 + 14 + 47 + 128 + 0 = 465\n    *   This is much greater than my outside offer of 144.\n\n*   **Offer 2: Be aggressive and give Player 2 less.**\n    *   Give [1, 1, 0, 1, 0] to Player 2\n    *   Keep [4, 3, 2, 3, 0]\n    *   My value: (4 * 92) + (3 * 7) + (2 * 47) + (3 * 64) + (0 * 15) = 368 + 21 + 94 + 192 + 0 = 675\n    *   This is a very high value and probably not acceptable to Player 2.\n\n*   **Offer 3: Try to get most of item 1 and item 4.**\n    *   Give [1, 2, 1, 1, 0] to Player 2\n    *   Keep [4, 2, 1, 3, 0]\n    *   My value: (4 * 92) + (2 * 7) + (1 * 47) + (3 * 64) + (0 * 15) = 368 + 14 + 47 + 192 + 0 = 621\n    *   This is still a high value.\n\nGiven these options, I think a good balance between being greedy and making a potentially acceptable offer is to start with the first offer. If the other player rejects, I can adjust in later rounds. It gives Player 2 a fair share, and my value is still significantly above my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 1, 2, 0]}\n```",

If I reject, the next round's value will be multiplied by 0.9.\n\nGiven that the current offer is worth 418, it's a pretty good offer. Trying to squeeze out a better deal might not be worth the risk of ending up with just my outside offer of 76 next round.\nTherefore, my best strategy here is to accept the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 3, 3, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    85 x 1 + 75 x 3 + 22 x 3 + 68 x 0 + 20 x 0\n    which is 376 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 377. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [7, 4, 0, 5, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    33 x 7 + 94 x 4 + 72 x 0 + 98 x 5 + 16 x 0\n    which is 1097 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1104. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's start by analyzing the current situation:\n\n1) Analysis of the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 1104.\n   - My values for items 1 through 5 are 33, 94, 72, 98, and 16, respectively.\n   - The total pool of items is 7 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor gamma is 0.9. This means that offers accepted in later rounds are worth less than offers accepted now.\n\n2) Assessing the value of offers:\n   - Current offer: There is no current offer.\n   - Potential counteroffers: I need to consider different divisions of items and calculate their value.\n   - Comparison to outside offer: I need to ensure any counteroffer I make results in a value greater than or equal to 1104.\n\nNow, let's try to construct an advantageous counteroffer, keeping in mind the mistakes to avoid. I will start by trying to offer Player 2 a small amount for each of the valuable items, keeping most for myself.\nLet's propose offering the other player 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4 and 0 unit of item 5. Then, I would keep 5 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4 and 2 unit of item 5. The calculation would be:\n\n5 units of item 1 = 5 * 33 = 165\n4 units of item 2 = 4 * 94 = 376\n0 units of item 3 = 0 * 72 = 0\n4 units of item 4 = 4 * 98 = 392\n2 units of item 5 = 2 * 16 = 32\nTotal value = 165 + 376 + 0 + 392 + 32 = 965\n\n965 < 1104.\n\nNow, let's propose offering the other player 1 units of item 1, 0 unit of item 2, 0 unit of item 3, 0 unit of item 4 and 0 unit of item 5. Then, I would keep 6 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4 and 2 unit of item 5. The calculation would be:\n\n6 units of item 1 = 6 * 33 = 198\n5 units of item 2 = 5 * 94 = 470\n0 units of item 3 = 0 * 72 = 0\n5 units of item 4 = 5 * 98 = 490\n2 units of item 5 = 2 * 16 = 32\nTotal value = 198 + 470 + 0 + 490 + 32 = 1190\n\n1190 > 1104.\n\n3) Decision:\n\nI will propose offering the other player 1 unit of item 1, 0 unit of item 2, 0 unit of item 3, 0 unit of item 4 and 0 unit of item 5.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

Since the current offer (65) is significantly less than my outside offer (924), accepting is not a good option.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. I want to maximize my value, so I need to figure out a reasonable offer that Player 1 might accept, while still giving me a value greater than 924 (after discounting in later rounds).\n\nI have the following items to distribute:\n- Item 1: 7 units\n- Item 2: 5 units\n- Item 3: 0 units\n- Item 4: 5 units\n- Item 5: 2 units\n\nLet's propose an offer where I keep most of the valuable items (item 2), and give Player 1 more of the less valuable items. My aim is to get close to my outside option, considering that the discount factor will lower values in later rounds.\n\nLet's propose the following counteroffer, where the numbers represent what *I give to Player 1*:\n[6, 0, 0, 0, 0] - I give Player 1 6 units of item 1\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0] - I give Player 1 0 units of item 2\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0] - I give Player 1 0 units of item 3\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0] - I give Player 1 0 units of item 4\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0] - I give Player 1 0 units of item 5\n\nThis means I keep:\n- Item 1: 1 unit (1 * 65 = 65)\n- Item 2: 5 units (5 * 84 = 420)\n- Item 3: 0 units (0 * 76 = 0)\n- Item 4: 5 units (5 * 36 = 180)\n- Item 5: 2 units (2 * 15 = 30)\nTotal Value: 65 + 420 + 0 + 180 + 30 = 695\n\nGiven that this is round 1, the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 1, so the value is unchanged. 695 is still lower than my outside offer, so it is not enough.\n\nLet's try another counteroffer, giving more value to myself:\n[4, 0, 0, 0, 0] - I give Player 1 4 units of item 1\n[0, 0, 0, 2, 0] - I give Player 1 2 units of item 4\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0] - I give Player 1 0 units of item 5\n\nThis means I keep:\n- Item 1: 3 units (3 * 65 = 195)\n- Item 2: 5 units (5 * 84 = 420)\n- Item 3: 0 units (0 * 76 = 0)\n- Item 4: 3 units (3 * 36 = 108)\n- Item 5: 2 units (2 * 15 = 30)\nTotal Value: 195 + 420 + 0 + 108 + 30 = 753\n\nStill not higher than my outside offer of 924.\nLet me make one more attempt, to give them only item 1.\n[7, 0, 0, 5, 2]\nThis means I keep:\n- Item 1: 0 units (0 * 65 = 0)\n- Item 2: 5 units (5 * 84 = 420)\n- Item 3: 0 units (0 * 76 = 0)\n- Item 4: 0 units (0 * 36 = 0)\n- Item 5: 0 units (0 * 15 = 0)\nTotal Value = 420\n\nI need to keep the most valuable items for me, even if it seems greedy. This also leaves items for Player 1 to counteroffer with.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 909. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player1, 2 units of each item (keeping 2 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 642 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 3, 2, 3, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 3, 2, 3, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the current offer and determine the best course of action.\n\nThe current offer gives me:\n*   Item 1: 3 units\n*   Item 2: 3 units\n*   Item 3: 2 units\n*   Item 4: 3 units\n*   Item 5: 1 unit\n\nMy values for these items are:\n*   Item 1: 1\n*   Item 2: 84\n*   Item 3: 23\n*   Item 4: 98\n*   Item 5: 8\n\nSo, the value of the current offer to me is:\n(3 * 1) + (3 * 84) + (2 * 23) + (3 * 98) + (1 * 8) = 3 + 252 + 46 + 294 + 8 = 603\n\nMy outside offer is 909. Since 603 is less than 909, accepting the offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider a counteroffer. I want to maximize my value while giving Player 1 enough to accept. Let's aim for a split that gives me slightly more than my outside offer, taking into account the discount factor in future rounds.\n\nSince this is round 1, the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 1.\n\nI have the following items available:\n*   Item 1: 4 units\n*   Item 2: 6 units\n*   Item 3: 4 units\n*   Item 4: 4 units\n*   Item 5: 3 units\n\nI want to keep as much of item 2 and item 4 as possible, since they have the highest value for me. Item 1 and item 5 have the lowest value for me.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I give Player 1:\n* Item 1: 1\n* Item 2: 3\n* Item 3: 2\n* Item 4: 1\n* Item 5: 2\n\nThis would leave me with:\n* Item 1: 3\n* Item 2: 3\n* Item 3: 2\n* Item 4: 3\n* Item 5: 1\n\nThe value of this to me is:\n(3 * 1) + (3 * 84) + (2 * 23) + (3 * 98) + (1 * 8) = 3 + 252 + 46 + 294 + 8 = 603. This is not good enough.\n\nLet's try something more aggressive and aim for a total value close to my outside option of 909.\n\nLet's offer:\n* Item 1: 4\n* Item 2: 6\n* Item 3: 4\n* Item 4: 0\n* Item 5: 3\n\nThat keeps 0 of each item, so my valuation is zero, so I want more.\n\nLet me calculate the total value of all the items to myself:\n4 * 1 + 6 * 84 + 4 * 23 + 4 * 98 + 3 * 8 = 4 + 504 + 92 + 392 + 24 = 1016.\n\nLet me try to aim for about 909/1016 = ~0.89 of the items.\nSo I want to keep roughly 89% of the items for myself.\n\nOkay, let's try to give Player 1 only the following:\n* Item 1: 2\n* Item 2: 1\n* Item 3: 2\n* Item 4: 0\n* Item 5: 1\n\nThis would leave me with:\n* Item 1: 2\n* Item 2: 5\n* Item 3: 2\n* Item 4: 4\n* Item 5: 2\n\nThe value of this to me is:\n(2 * 1) + (5 * 84) + (2 * 23) + (4 * 98) + (2 * 8) = 2 + 420 + 46 + 392 + 16 = 876.\n\nThis is still below my outside offer of 909. Let's try a more favorable offer to me:\n* Item 1: 3\n* Item 2: 1\n* Item 3: 2\n* Item 4: 0\n* Item 5: 1\n\nThis would leave me with:\n* Item 1: 1\n* Item 2: 5\n* Item 3: 2\n* Item 4: 4\n* Item 5: 2\n\nThe value of this to me is:\n(1 * 1) + (5 * 84) + (2 * 23) + (4 * 98) + (2 * 8) = 1 + 420 + 46 + 392 + 16 = 875.\n\nSince round 1 offer to me is 603 and my outside offer is 909, it makes sense to walk away, as any offer to player 1 will have to give away items of high value.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 5, 2, 4, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    47 x 0 + 64 x 5 + 92 x 2 + 39 x 4 + 25 x 4\n    which is 760 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 763. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

This means offers in later rounds are worth less (e.g., an offer worth 800 in round 2 is worth 800 * 0.9 = 720 to me now).\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer: None.\n   - Potential counteroffers: I need to find an offer that gives me more than 763 in value.\n\n3) **Considerations for the first offer:**\n\nSince this is the first round, I want to make an offer that is somewhat reasonable but still leaves me with a good chunk of the value. I also want to avoid offering nothing or everything. Let's start by trying to give away roughly half the value to the other player, and adjusting until it reaches a value over 763 for me.\n\nLet's start by proposing giving the following items to Player 2: 0 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 2 of item 4, and 2 of item 5.\nThis would leave me with:\n- 1 item 1\n- 3 item 2\n- 3 item 3\n- 2 item 4\n- 2 item 5\n\nValue to me:\n(1 * 47) + (3 * 64) + (3 * 92) + (2 * 39) + (2 * 25) = 47 + 192 + 276 + 78 + 50 = 643\n\nThis is way below 763.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 976. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1206 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 2, 5, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    57 x 4 + 100 x 2 + 100 x 5 + 100 x 0 + 45 x 1\n    which is 973 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 976. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step to make an informed decision.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 976\n*   My item values: Item 1: 57, Item 2: 100, Item 3: 100, Item 4: 100, Item 5: 45\n*   Total items: Item 1: 4, Item 2: 2, Item 3: 5, Item 4: 0, Item 5: 5\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means that offers in later rounds are worth less to me.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   Current offer: None.\n*   Potential counteroffers: I need to determine what offer to make that is better than my outside offer. I want to give away as little as possible while still potentially being accepted by the other player.\n\n3) **Developing a good initial offer:**\n\nSince I don't know Player 2's values, a good starting point is to try to give Player 2 items that I value less and keep items I value more. I need to make sure whatever I keep is worth more than my outside option.\n\nLet's try offering Player 2 all of item 1 and a portion of other items:\n\nKeeping [0, 2, 5, 0, 5] for myself:\n* Item 1: 0 * 57 = 0\n* Item 2: 2 * 100 = 200\n* Item 3: 5 * 100 = 500\n* Item 4: 0 * 100 = 0\n* Item 5: 5 * 45 = 225\n* Total: 925\n\nThis is less than my outside offer, so it is not an acceptable offer to keep, meaning offering the remaining items to Player 2 is not a valid strategy.\n\nLet's try offering Player 2 a smaller portion:\nOffering Player 2 [2, 0, 2, 0, 2]:\nThis would mean I keep [2, 2, 3, 0, 3]\n* Item 1: 2 * 57 = 114\n* Item 2: 2 * 100 = 200\n* Item 3: 3 * 100 = 300\n* Item 4: 0 * 100 = 0\n* Item 5: 3 * 45 = 135\n* Total: 749\n\nThis is still less than my outside offer value of 976, so I'll need to be more conservative.\n\nLet's try offering Player 2 [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]\nThis means I would keep [3, 2, 4, 0, 4]\n* Item 1: 3 * 57 = 171\n* Item 2: 2 * 100 = 200\n* Item 3: 4 * 100 = 400\n* Item 4: 0 * 100 = 0\n* Item 5: 4 * 45 = 180\n* Total: 951\n\nThis is still less than my outside offer, so I need to keep more.\n\nLet's try offering Player 2 [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\nThis means I keep [4, 2, 5, 0, 4]\n* Item 1: 4 * 57 = 228\n* Item 2: 2 * 100 = 200\n* Item 3: 5 * 100 = 500\n* Item 4: 0 * 100 = 0\n* Item 5: 4 * 45 = 180\n* Total: 1108\n\nThis is greater than my outside offer. It is also an improvement on a completely greedy offer where I would be offering nothing to the player 2. I think this is a reasonable starting point to elicit a response.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]}\n",

This means accepting an offer in round 2 is worth 0.9 times the face value, and in round 3 it is worth 0.9^2 = 0.81 times the face value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [2, 1, 2, 0, 2]. This means I get 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5. My total value from this offer is:\n    (2 * 57) + (1 * 100) + (2 * 100) + (0 * 100) + (2 * 45) = 114 + 100 + 200 + 0 + 90 = 504\n    Since this is round 2, the discounted value is 504 * 0.9 = 453.6. This is significantly less than my outside offer of 976.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to propose an offer that gives me a value greater than 976. Let's try to construct a counteroffer.\n    I start by keeping all the items for myself: [4, 2, 5, 0, 5].

Therefore, accepting is not a good option.\n\nI can either walk away and receive 976, or I can propose a counteroffer. Let's propose a counteroffer where I keep almost all items for myself. I will offer Player 2 my lowest valued item, item 5, one unit. This would be offering [0, 0, 0, 0, 1].\nMy total value: (4 * 57) + (2 * 100) + (5 * 100) + (0 * 100) + (4 * 45) = 228 + 200 + 500 + 0 + 180 = 1108.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. It's round 2, and Player 1 is offering me [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]. This means they want me to have 1 unit of item 5 and they keep the rest. My values are: item 1: 72, item 2: 10, item 3: 10, item 4: 77, item 5: 7. So, their offer gives me a value of 1 * 7 = 7.\n\nMy outside offer is 36. Since 7 is less than 36, accepting the offer would be a bad choice.\n\nNow let's consider making a counteroffer. I have the following items: 4 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 5 units of item 5.\n\nTo maximize my value, I want to keep the items I value highly (1 and 4) and give away items I value less (2, 3, and 5).  However, I also need to consider what Player 1 might accept.\n\nLet's calculate the value if I keep everything:\nItem 1: 4 * 72 = 288\nItem 2: 2 * 10 = 20\nItem 3: 5 * 10 = 50\nItem 4: 0 * 77 = 0\nItem 5: 5 * 7 = 35\nTotal: 393\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I give Player 1 just a bit more than their current offer: give them 2 units of item 5.\nMy value would be:\nItem 1: 4 * 72 = 288\nItem 2: 2 * 10 = 20\nItem 3: 5 * 10 = 50\nItem 4: 0 * 77 = 0\nItem 5: 3 * 7 = 21\nTotal: 379\nThis is still way more than my outside offer of 36.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to get more of item 1, as I value it highly. If I offer player 1 the remaining items.\nThen player 1 gets: \nItem 1: 0 * 72 = 0\nItem 2: 2 * 10 = 20\nItem 3: 5 * 10 = 50\nItem 4: 0 * 77 = 0\nItem 5: 5 * 7 = 35\nSo I offer [0,2,5,0,5].\nThen I keep everything of item 1 which gives a value of 288 and nothing of item 2,3,4,5. This gives 288.\n\nSince it's round 2, if I make a counteroffer, it needs to be appealing enough for Player 1 to accept, otherwise they might walk in round 3 and we both get our outside offers discounted by 0.9^2. I am going to make a counteroffer that increases their item 5 amount to 3.\n\nMy offer to Player 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3]\nThen I get:\nItem 1: 4 * 72 = 288\nItem 2: 2 * 10 = 20\nItem 3: 5 * 10 = 50\nItem 4: 0 * 77 = 0\nItem 5: 2 * 7 = 14\nTotal value: 372.\nDiscounted by 0.9 = 334.8\nMy outside offer discounted by 0.9 is 32.4\n\nSo I offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 3].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 3]}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 2, 5, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    57 x 4 + 100 x 2 + 100 x 5 + 100 x 0 + 45 x 1\n    which is 973 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 976. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 1, 2, 0, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\n1) **Current Situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 976\n*   My item values: item 1 = 57, item 2 = 100, item 3 = 100, item 4 = 100, item 5 = 45\n*   Total items: 4 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5\n*   Discount factor: 0.9. Since this is round 3, the discount factor is 0.9^(3-1) = 0.9^2 = 0.81\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [0, 0, 0, 0, 3]. This means I would receive 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n    *   Value of current offer: (0 * 57) + (0 * 100) + (0 * 100) + (0 * 100) + (3 * 45) = 135\n    *   Discounted value of current offer: 135 * 0.81 = 109.35\n\n*   **Outside Offer:** My outside offer is worth 976. Discounted value of outside offer: 976 * 0.81 = 790.56\n*   **Possible Counteroffers:** I need to make a counteroffer that is worth more than my outside offer when I keep the rest.\n\nConsider keeping all of items 1, 2, 3, and 4 and only one of item 5. Then I offer all the rest to the opponent. This means giving [0,0,0,0,4] to the opponent.\nMy value: (4 * 57) + (2 * 100) + (5 * 100) + (0 * 100) + (1 * 45) = 228 + 200 + 500 + 0 + 45 = 973. Discounted value is 788.13, which is less than the discounted outside offer, so I don't like this offer.\nIf I keep two of item 5, my value goes up to 973 + 45 = 1018, so still not enough to accept.\n\nI have been trying to get the other player to give me item 5 because I think I can make more value.\n\nLet's consider giving [4, 2, 5, 0, 2]. This keeps zero of items 1,2,3 and 3 of item 5 and zero of item 4.\nMy value is (0 * 57) + (0 * 100) + (0 * 100) + (0 * 100) + (3 * 45) = 135, which is low.\n\nLet's consider offering [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I keep everything. My value is\n(4 * 57) + (2 * 100) + (5 * 100) + (0 * 100) + (5 * 45) = 228 + 200 + 500 + 0 + 225 = 1153.\nDiscounted value is 933.93. \n\nLet's consider offering [0,0,0,0,1] to Player 2. Then I keep 4, 2, 5, 0, 4.\nMy value is (4 * 57) + (2 * 100) + (5 * 100) + (0 * 100) + (4 * 45) = 228 + 200 + 500 + 0 + 180 = 1108. Discounted = 897.48.\nSo I don't want to do this.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\nThe current offer is terrible (109.35 value). The best offer is to keep all items with a discounted value of 933.93. My discounted outside option is 790.56. I should counter offer to keep all the items, since that is the only way for me to get a good deal here.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 88. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 447 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    30 x 0 + 6 x 1 + 32 x 0 + 62 x 1 + 19 x 1\n    which is 87 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 88. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

This means offers in later rounds are worth less (e.g., an offer worth 100 in round 2 is only worth 90).\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer: None.\n   - Potential counteroffers: Need to find a division that gives me a value greater than 88.\n\n3) **Initial strategy:**\n   - As the first player, I should make a reasonable counteroffer that is beneficial to me while leaving some room for negotiation.\n\nI want to create an offer such that Player 2 gets some items, but I retain items with high value to me. Let's try an initial offer where I give player 2 some of the less valuable items and keep the majority of the more valuable items for myself.\n\nHere's a potential counteroffer: Give Player 2 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5. This means I keep 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n\nMy value for this offer would be:\n(2 * 30) + (1 * 6) + (2 * 32) + (2 * 62) + (2 * 19) = 60 + 6 + 64 + 124 + 38 = 292\n\nSince 292 > 88, this offer is better than my outside option.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 1, 0, 1]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 556. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player1, 2 units of each item (keeping 2 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 735 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 1, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [3, 2, 3, 0, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 2, 3, 0, 3]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\nCurrent offer to me: [3, 2, 3, 0, 3]\n\nThis means Player 1 gets:\nItem 1: 4 - 3 = 1\nItem 2: 2 - 2 = 0\nItem 3: 3 - 3 = 0\nItem 4: 2 - 0 = 2\nItem 5: 3 - 3 = 0\n\nMy values are:\nItem 1: 96\nItem 2: 61\nItem 3: 8\nItem 4: 31\nItem 5: 49\n\nValue of current offer to me:\n(3 * 96) + (2 * 61) + (3 * 8) + (0 * 31) + (3 * 49) = 288 + 122 + 24 + 0 + 147 = 581\n\nSince this is round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9\n\nDiscounted value of current offer to me: 581 * 0.9 = 522.9\n\nMy outside offer is 556.  Since 522.9 < 556, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider a counteroffer. I need to offer something that Player 1 is likely to accept, while still giving me a value greater than my outside offer (556), accounting for the discount factor.\n\nI could try to take almost everything and offer the other player very little, but that would likely lead to them walking away. I want to propose an allocation that gives me at least 556/0.9 = 617.78 in value.\n\nLet's try offering Player 1: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nThis means I get:\nItem 1: 4 - 1 = 3\nItem 2: 2 - 1 = 1\nItem 3: 3 - 1 = 2\nItem 4: 2 - 1 = 1\nItem 5: 3 - 1 = 2\n\nValue to me:\n(3 * 96) + (1 * 61) + (2 * 8) + (1 * 31) + (2 * 49) = 288 + 61 + 16 + 31 + 98 = 494\n\nDiscounted value: 494 * 0.9 = 444.6.  This is still below my outside offer.\n\nLet me try offering Player 1 only a tiny bit of items.\n\nLet's offer Player 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nThis means I get:\nItem 1: 4 - 0 = 4\nItem 2: 2 - 0 = 2\nItem 3: 3 - 0 = 3\nItem 4: 2 - 0 = 2\nItem 5: 3 - 0 = 3\n\nValue to me:\n(4 * 96) + (2 * 61) + (3 * 8) + (2 * 31) + (3 * 49) = 384 + 122 + 24 + 62 + 147 = 739\n\nDiscounted value: 739 * 0.9 = 665.1\n\nThis is the best possible outcome for me, but is unlikely that Player 1 accepts. However, it is worth a shot.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    30 x 0 + 6 x 1 + 32 x 0 + 62 x 1 + 19 x 1\n    which is 87 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 88. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 1, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [3, 2, 3, 0, 3]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Current Situation Analysis:**\n\n   - My outside offer value: 88\n   - My values per unit of item: [30, 6, 32, 62, 19]\n   - Total items: 4 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 3 of item 5.\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This only matters if I were to make a counteroffer, but as we are in the final round, any counteroffer that Player 2 might make counts as a walk anyway.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - Current offer: I'm being offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I keep all the items.\n      - My value if I accept: (4 * 30) + (2 * 6) + (3 * 32) + (2 * 62) + (3 * 19) = 120 + 12 + 96 + 124 + 57 = 409\n      - This is much greater than my outside offer of 88.\n\n   - Potential counteroffers: Since this is the last round, any counteroffer I make is final, and any counteroffer Player 2 makes counts as a walk anyway.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 601. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player1, 2 units of each item (keeping 2 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 651 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 2, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 3, 2, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the current offer and determine the best course of action.\n\nThe current offer gives me:\n* Item 1: 1 unit\n* Item 2: 3 units\n* Item 3: 2 units\n* Item 4: 2 units\n* Item 5: 0 units\n\nMy values for each item are:\n* Item 1: 62\n* Item 2: 20\n* Item 3: 22\n* Item 4: 32\n* Item 5: 81\n\nSo, the value of the current offer to me is:\n(1 * 62) + (3 * 20) + (2 * 22) + (2 * 32) + (0 * 81) = 62 + 60 + 44 + 64 + 0 = 230\n\nSince my outside offer is 601, accepting the current offer of 230 is worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. My goal is to get a deal worth more than 601. If I were to demand everything, Player 1 would likely walk away. I need to find a split that gives Player 1 enough value to accept, while still giving me more than 601. I need to consider Player 1's valuations, which I don't know.\n\nHowever, since this is round 1, I have some room to negotiate. It is often better to make a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer, allowing for future negotiation. I will make a counteroffer that gives Player 1 significantly more than I am currently receiving, but still gives me more than the current offer, to see Player 1's response.\n\nLet's start by offering Player 1 half of each item.\n* Item 1: 5 units total, offer 2 to player 1. Keep 3, value 3*62 = 186\n* Item 2: 9 units total, offer 4 to player 1. Keep 5, value 5*20 = 100\n* Item 3: 7 units total, offer 3 to player 1. Keep 4, value 4*22 = 88\n* Item 4: 8 units total, offer 4 to player 1. Keep 4, value 4*32 = 128\n* Item 5: 2 units total, offer 1 to player 1. Keep 1, value 1*81 = 81\n\nTotal value to me: 186 + 100 + 88 + 128 + 81 = 583. This is still less than my outside offer.\n\nTo guarantee a payoff higher than my outside offer, I need to offer very little to Player 1. However, that makes a deal unlikely. Let me try to offer a deal that gives Player 1 a bit more than the current offer's value to me (230). Since I don't know Player 1's values, I will try to make a somewhat fair-seeming split that favors me, and see how player 1 reacts.\n\nLet's give Player 1: 2 of item 1, 5 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 4 of item 4, 1 of item 5.\nThen I get: 3 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 4 of item 4, 1 of item 5.\n\nMy value: (3*62) + (4*20) + (4*22) + (4*32) + (1*81) = 186 + 80 + 88 + 128 + 81 = 563. Still not greater than 601.\n\nLet's re-evaluate. I think I should offer 0 of everything, so that Player 1 gets nothing and I get everything, or WALK. But, I need to consider if I can get a better deal by giving player 1 some items. If Player 1 accepts this I get a great deal.\n\nSo, I will offer Player 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 8, 0, 8, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    23 x 0 + 89 x 8 + 85 x 0 + 100 x 8 + 1 x 0\n    which is 1512 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1513. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

So let's start by making a counteroffer, giving Player 2 a large fraction of items. Let's start by offering half of each item. Given that this is round 1 and time is on my side, I can afford to start with a somewhat conservative offer.\n   - Let's start by an offer where I give:\n        *   Item 1: 1 unit\n        *   Item 2: 2 units\n        *   Item 3: 1 unit\n        *   Item 4: 3 units\n        *   Item 5: 2 units\n    - I keep the rest, which is:\n        *   Item 1: 1 unit\n        *   Item 2: 3 units\n        *   Item 3: 2 unit\n        *   Item 4: 3 units\n        *   Item 5: 2 units\n    - Value of what I keep: 1 * 29 + 3 * 45 + 2 * 44 + 3 * 29 + 2 * 53 = 29 + 135 + 88 + 87 + 106 = 445.\n\nSince 445 is greater than my outside option of 413, this is an offer that is better than my outside option. Now, let's make a slightly better offer for me.\n\nLet's try giving Player 2 the following offer:\n*   Item 1: 1 unit\n*   Item 2: 3 unit\n*   Item 3: 1 unit\n*   Item 4: 3 units\n*   Item 5: 2 units\n\nThen I keep:\n*   Item 1: 1 unit\n*   Item 2: 2 unit\n*   Item 3: 2 unit\n*   Item 4: 3 units\n*   Item 5: 2 units\n\nValue of what I keep: 1 * 29 + 2 * 45 + 2 * 44 + 3 * 29 + 2 * 53 = 29 + 90 + 88 + 87 + 106 = 400.\n\n400 is worse than my outside offer of 413. Therefore, this is not a valid offer.\n\nLet's try another offer:\n*   Item 1: 0 unit\n*   Item 2: 2 unit\n*   Item 3: 1 unit\n*   Item 4: 2 units\n*   Item 5: 2 units\n\nThen I keep:\n*   Item 1: 2 unit\n*   Item 2: 3 unit\n*   Item 3: 2 unit\n*   Item 4: 4 units\n*   Item 5: 2 units\n\nValue of what I keep: 2 * 29 + 3 * 45 + 2 * 44 + 4 * 29 + 2 * 53 = 58 + 135 + 88 + 116 + 106 = 503.\n\nSince 503 is greater than my outside option of 413, this is an offer that is better than my outside option.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 1, 2, 2]}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 3, 6, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    29 x 0 + 45 x 0 + 44 x 3 + 29 x 6 + 53 x 2\n    which is 412 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 413. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 1, 2, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 2, 0, 3, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 0, 3, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 413\n*   My item values: item 1 = 29, item 2 = 45, item 3 = 44, item 4 = 29, item 5 = 53\n*   Total items: 2 of item 1, 5 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 6 of item 4, 4 of item 5\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. Since we are in round 2, the discount factor will be 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am offered [0, 2, 0, 3, 0]. This means Player 2 is giving me 0 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n\n    Value of current offer: (0 * 29) + (2 * 45) + (0 * 44) + (3 * 29) + (0 * 53) = 0 + 90 + 0 + 87 + 0 = 177\n    Discounted value of current offer: 177 * 0.9 = 159.3\n\n*   Since 159.3 < 413, accepting the current offer is worse than my outside offer.\n\nNow let's consider some potential counteroffers. I want to keep as much of the valuable items (items 2, 3, and 5) as possible. I have to offer something to the other player though.\n\nLet's calculate the value if I keep all of Items 2, 3, and 5 for myself: 5*45 + 3*44 + 4*53 = 225 + 132 + 212 = 569. If I offer Player 2 all of items 1 and 4, that means my offer would be [2,0,0,6,0]. The value to me of keeping the other items would be 569, higher than my outside offer. Let's try to improve that.\n\nHere's an approach where I attempt to give Player 2 a good offer that is still worse than my outside offer: If the value is too high I should consider giving away some item 5 (worth 53).\noffer_to_player_2 = [0, 2, 1, 2, 2]\nmy_value = (2-0)*29 + (5-2)*45 + (3-1)*44 + (6-2)*29 + (4-2)*53 = 58 + 135 + 88 + 116 + 106 = 503\nThis is greater than my outside offer of 413. But it's only in round 2, so let's try to get a little more from the deal.\n\nLet's consider offering [0, 3, 1, 3, 2]:\nmy_value = (2-0)*29 + (5-3)*45 + (3-1)*44 + (6-3)*29 + (4-2)*53 = 58 + 90 + 88 + 87 + 106 = 429\nDiscounted value: 429 * 0.9 = 386.1.  Still less than my outside offer.\n\nLet's consider offering [0, 3, 1, 3, 1]:\nmy_value = (2-0)*29 + (5-3)*45 + (3-1)*44 + (6-3)*29 + (4-1)*53 = 58 + 90 + 88 + 87 + 159 = 482\nDiscounted Value: 482 * 0.9 = 433.8 This is better than my outside offer, so let's lower my offer on Item 5.\n\nLet's consider offering [0, 3, 1, 3, 0]:\nmy_value = (2-0)*29 + (5-3)*45 + (3-1)*44 + (6-3)*29 + (4-0)*53 = 58 + 90 + 88 + 87 + 212 = 535\nDiscounted Value: 535 * 0.9 = 481.5\n\nLet's consider offering [0, 3, 1, 4, 1]:\nmy_value = (2-0)*29 + (5-3)*45 + (3-1)*44 + (6-4)*29 + (4-1)*53 = 58 + 90 + 88 + 58 + 159 = 453\nDiscounted Value: 453 * 0.9 = 407.7\nThat is less than my outside offer so let's not do that.\n\nLet's go back to offering [0, 3, 1, 3, 1], but try to decrease the value: [0, 3, 1, 4, 0]:\nmy_value = (2-0)*29 + (5-3)*45 + (3-1)*44 + (6-4)*29 + (4-0)*53 = 58 + 90 + 88 + 58 + 212 = 506\nDiscounted value = 455.4. Let's go with that.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is bad.

The value is 536 * 0.9^(2-1) = 536 * 0.9 = 482.4\n\nThis value (482.4) is less than my outside offer of 563.\n\n**Possible Actions and Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **ACCEPT:**  The discounted value of accepting the offer is 482.4, which is less than my outside offer of 563.  Therefore, accepting is not the best option.\n\n2.  **WALK:** Walking away guarantees my outside offer of 563.\n\n3.  **COUNTEROFFER:** To make a worthwhile counteroffer, the potential value *after* the discount should exceed my outside offer of 563. This is the last round where I can make a counteroffer, thus it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nSince a counteroffer will be treated as a walk, and the current offer is worse than walking away, the best course of action is to WALK.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 716. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1119 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 2, 1, 0, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    52 x 2 + 85 x 2 + 70 x 1 + 92 x 0 + 74 x 5\n    which is 714 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 716. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Let's explore a few possibilities, aiming for a balance. It's probably not wise to offer everything or nothing. I will also explore how that looks like to give away roughly half the items of each kind to the other player.\n    *   **Offer 1: [1, 1, 1, 1, 3]** (Giving 1 of items 1-4 and 3 of item 5 to Player 2)\n        *   Items kept: [2, 2, 2, 2, 3]\n        *   Value: (2 * 52) + (2 * 85) + (2 * 70) + (2 * 92) + (3 * 74) = 104 + 170 + 140 + 184 + 222 = 820.\n        *   This offer is better than the outside offer.\n\n    *   **Offer 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]** (Offering nothing to Player 2)\n        *   Items kept: [3, 3, 3, 3, 6]\n        *   Value: (3 * 52) + (3 * 85) + (3 * 70) + (3 * 92) + (6 * 74) = 156 + 255 + 210 + 276 + 444 = 1341.\n        *   While the maximum value, starting with a completely greedy offer may not be the best strategy\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nGiven that it's Round 1, offering nothing or all items is not a smart approach.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\n1) **Current Situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 716\n*   My values per item: 52 for item 1, 85 for item 2, 70 for item 3, 92 for item 4, 74 for item 5.\n*   Total items: 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5.\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means accepting an offer next round is worth 90% of its value this round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** I am offered [0, 2, 0, 0, 6]. This means I get 0 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 6 units of item 5. This leaves me with:\n    *   3 units of item 1\n    *   1 unit of item 2\n    *   3 units of item 3\n    *   3 units of item 4\n    *   0 units of item 5\n\n    My value for this outcome is:\n    (3 * 52) + (1 * 85) + (3 * 70) + (3 * 92) + (0 * 74) = 156 + 85 + 210 + 276 + 0 = 727\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** 727 > 716, so accepting the current offer is better than walking away *right now*. However, we need to factor in the discount factor for later rounds.\n\n3) **Potential Counteroffers:**\n\nLet's analyze the previous offers to understand the other agent's preferences.\n\n*   Round 1, Player 1 offered: [1, 1, 1, 1, 3]\n*   Round 1, Player 2 offered: [0, 2, 0, 0, 6]\n\nPlayer 2 seems to highly value item 2 and item 5. I value item 4 most, followed by item 2.\n\nSince the current offer is slightly above my outside offer, and we are in round 2 (leaving only round 3 where I have no control), I should try to get more value by making a counteroffer.\n\n**Possible Counteroffer Strategy:**\nGive player 2 some of what they seem to want to try to get player 4.\n\nLet's consider offering [1, 2, 1, 0, 4].\n*   Player 2 gets: 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5.\n*   I get: 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5.\nMy value would be: (2 * 52) + (1 * 85) + (2 * 70) + (3 * 92) + (2 * 74) = 104 + 85 + 140 + 276 + 148 = 753\n\nThis offer yields 753, which is better than my outside offer of 716, so this is a possibility.\n\nLet's consider offering [1, 2, 0, 0, 5].\n*   Player 2 gets: 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 0 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5.\n*   I get: 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 1 units of item 5.\nMy value would be: (2 * 52) + (1 * 85) + (3 * 70) + (3 * 92) + (1 * 74) = 104 + 85 + 210 + 276 + 74 = 749\n\n**Decision:**\n\nI will make a counteroffer to try and get a better deal than my outside offer. I'll offer the following:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 1, 0, 4]}\n",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 2, 1, 0, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    52 x 2 + 85 x 2 + 70 x 1 + 92 x 0 + 74 x 5\n    which is 714 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 716. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

I need to figure out if there's a better deal I can get by offering something different to Player 1. Given that this is the first round, I should aim for a more favorable split. Let's consider aiming for an equal split.\n\nHere's what an equal split would look like (approximately, since we have odd numbers of items):\n\n*   Item 1: Player 1 gets 0, I get 1\n*   Item 2: Player 1 gets 2, I get 3\n*   Item 3: Player 1 gets 2, I get 2\n*   Item 4: Player 1 gets 1, I get 2\n*   Item 5: Player 1 gets 1, I get 1\n\nIf I offer Player 1 [0, 2, 2, 1, 1], my value is:\n(1 * 10) + (3 * 44) + (2 * 22) + (2 * 63) + (1 * 16) = 10 + 132 + 44 + 126 + 16 = 328\n\nWhile this is less than the current offer's value to me, this is only round 1, and Player 1 might accept it.\n\nAnother option is to make a slight adjustment to the current offer to test the waters. For example, offer Player 1 one more unit of item 2. The offer would be [0, 2, 1, 0, 0].\n\nIf I offer Player 1 [0, 2, 1, 0, 0], my value is:\n(1 * 10) + (3 * 44) + (3 * 22) + (3 * 63) + (2 * 16) = 10 + 132 + 66 + 189 + 32 = 429\n\nLet's compare both offers:\n- Equal split offer: value = 328\n- Slight adjustment: value = 429\n- Current offer: value = 473\n\nI think offering the slight adjustment is the best strategy. It is a reasonable offer but better for me than the equal split. Player 1 is likely to accept it or make a counteroffer close to it, increasing my payoff compared to accepting right away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 1, 0, 0]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    81 x 1 + 20 x 1 + 71 x 2 + 31 x 3 + 39 x 0\n    which is 336 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 337. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 2, 1, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 1, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Since we are in round 2, accepting now means my value is multiplied by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [0, 2, 1, 0, 0]. This means I get 0 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5. My value for this offer is:\n    (0 * 81) + (2 * 20) + (1 * 71) + (0 * 31) + (0 * 39) = 0 + 40 + 71 + 0 + 0 = 111.\n    Since we are in round 2, the discounted value is 111 * 0.9 = 99.9. This is much lower than my outside offer of 337.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that gives me a value higher than 337. Let's see what I would have if I kept everything:\n    (1 * 81) + (5 * 20) + (4 * 71) + (3 * 31) + (2 * 39) = 81 + 100 + 284 + 93 + 78 = 636.\n\nLet's consider offering Player 2 only the items they are offering me in the current round, namely 0 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 0 of item 4, and 0 of item 5.\nThis means I would keep 1 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 3 of item 4, and 2 of item 5.

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 130. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 130. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 858 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 1, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    70 x 0 + 47 x 1 + 74 x 1 + 8 x 1 + 87 x 0\n    which is 129 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 130. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Since this is round 1, the discount factor doesn't directly impact the decision *yet*, but it will in future rounds. The later a deal is made, the less valuable it is.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table, so I cannot evaluate it.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** This is where it gets interesting. I need to propose an offer to Player 2 that is good enough to be accepted, but also leaves me with a value greater than my outside offer. I need to consider what Player 2 might value these items at. I have no information about player 2's valuation so I should bias my offer to be in my favor.\n    For a start, let's consider an offer where I give away 1 unit of each item to player 2.\n\n    My remaining items would be:\n    2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4, 1 units of item 5\n    Total Value = 2*70 + 3*47 + 0*74 + 1*8 + 1*87 = 140 + 141 + 0 + 8 + 87 = 376\n\n    This value exceeds my outside offer of 130. This seems like a safe starting offer. Let's try an initial offer of [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (giving 1 unit of each to Player 2)\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Since there is no current offer, I cannot accept.\n*   Walking away would give me 130.\n*   I will propose a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 179. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player1, 2 units of each item (keeping 2 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 684 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 3, 0, 1, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 3, 0, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 3, 0, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\nThe current offer on the table is [0, 3, 0, 1, 0]. This means I get 0 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n\nMy private values are:\n- Item 1: 41\n- Item 2: 7\n- Item 3: 93\n- Item 4: 21\n- Item 5: 66\n\nMy value for the current offer is:\n(0 * 41) + (3 * 7) + (0 * 93) + (1 * 21) + (0 * 66) = 0 + 21 + 0 + 21 + 0 = 42\n\nSince this is round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\nSo, the present value of accepting the current offer is 42 * 0.9 = 37.8.\n\nMy outside offer is 179.\n\nSince 37.8 is significantly less than 179, accepting the current offer is not a good choice. I need to either walk away or make a counteroffer.\n\nLet's consider a possible counteroffer. I have the following items:\n- Item 1: 3 units\n- Item 2: 4 units\n- Item 3: 1 unit\n- Item 4: 2 units\n- Item 5: 2 units\n\nI need to make a counteroffer that is better than walking away (179). Let's consider giving Player 1 only items they value less, and keeping the items that I value more.\n\nI could try to take all the item 3 and item 5, since I value them highly. Let's see if giving Player 1 [3, 4, 0, 2, 0] is reasonable. This would mean I get [0, 0, 1, 0, 2]. This gives me a value of 1 * 93 + 2 * 66 = 93 + 132 = 225. Discounted by 0.9 it's 225 * 0.9 = 202.5 which is greater than my outside offer.\n\nLet's see if I can improve this. I could try giving Player 1 [3, 3, 0, 2, 0] , which means I keep [0, 1, 1, 0, 2] -> 0 + 7 + 93 + 0 + 132 = 232, and discounted 208.8\n\nOr [3, 2, 0, 2, 0] , I get to keep [0, 2, 1, 0, 2] = 14 + 93 + 132 = 239 * 0.9 = 215.1\n\nI could also try to offer player 1 the amount they offered me originally [0,3,0,1,0], and keep the rest. [3, 1, 1, 1, 2], my value would be 123 + 7 + 93 + 21 + 132 = 376, discounted 338.4, which is very high. However, it's likely they would reject this offer, since it's very close to my full value.\n\nGiven the fact that it's round 2, and I want to maximize my chance of getting a deal, I'm going to give Player 1 almost all the items except item 3.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 4, 0, 2, 1]}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 1, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Let's offer 1 unit of Item 1, 1 Unit of Item 2, and 1 Unit of Item 5.\n\n    Player 2 receives a value of 1*17 + 1*22 + 1*29 = 17+22+29 = 68\n    I keep: 3x17 + 2x22 + 7x98 + 3x84 + 2x29 = 51 + 44 + 686 + 252 + 58 = 1091\n    This leaves me with a value of 1091 which is greater than my outside offer of 1058. This looks like a reasonable initial counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]}\n```",

The key is to try and secure Items 1, 2, and 5 for myself and offer most of items 3 and some of items 4 to Player 1. Let's start by testing a proposed offer of [1, 1, 5, 1, 1] for the amount given to Player 1.\nThis leaves me with:\n*   Item 1: 4 - 1 = 3 units\n*   Item 2: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n*   Item 3: 7 - 5 = 2 units\n*   Item 4: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n*   Item 5: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n\nThe value of this outcome to me would be:\n(3 * 66) + (2 * 87) + (2 * 73) + (2 * 24) + (2 * 43) = 198 + 174 + 146 + 48 + 86 = 652\n\nThis result is below my outside offer of 1117 and the discount factor of 0.9 will be applied in the next round, making it even less appealing. So, let's try and get more for myself by offering Player 1 less of item 3.\n\nLet's consider an offer of [1, 1, 4, 1, 1]. This leaves me with:\n*   Item 1: 4 - 1 = 3 units\n*   Item 2: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n*   Item 3: 7 - 4 = 3 units\n*   Item 4: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n*   Item 5: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n\nThe value of this outcome to me would be:\n(3 * 66) + (2 * 87) + (3 * 73) + (2 * 24) + (2 * 43) = 198 + 174 + 219 + 48 + 86 = 725.\n\nThis is still below my outside offer, so I will walk.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 10, 3, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    93 x 0 + 51 x 0 + 61 x 10 + 63 x 3 + 20 x 1\n    which is 819 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 820. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

This means that offers accepted in later rounds are worth less to both players.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   Since there is no current offer, I need to consider potential counteroffers.\n*   I want to find an offer that gives Player 2 enough to make them accept, while still leaving me with a value greater than my outside offer of 820.\n\n3) **Consider a potential offer:**\n\nLet's start with a simple offer and see how it values.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 820. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 864 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 10, 3, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    93 x 0 + 51 x 0 + 61 x 10 + 63 x 3 + 20 x 1\n    which is 819 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 820. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 5, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 5, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n1) **Current Situation Analysis:**\n\n*   **Outside Offer Value:** 820\n*   **Item Values:** Item 1 = 93, Item 2 = 51, Item 3 = 61, Item 4 = 63, Item 5 = 20\n*   **Total Item Pool:** Item 1 = 3, Item 2 = 3, Item 3 = 10, Item 4 = 4, Item 5 = 2\n*   **Discount Factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means accepting an offer in round 2 is worth 0.9 times the face value, and in round 3, it would be 0.9^2 times the face value.\n\n2) **Value Assessment:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** Player 2 is offering me [0, 0, 5, 0, 0]. This means I would receive:\n    *   0 units of item 1: 0 * 93 = 0\n    *   0 units of item 2: 0 * 51 = 0\n    *   5 units of item 3: 5 * 61 = 305\n    *   0 units of item 4: 0 * 63 = 0\n    *   0 units of item 5: 0 * 20 = 0\n    *   Total Value: 305\n\n    Since it is round 2, we multiply by the discount factor: 305 * 0.9 = 274.5. This is less than my outside offer of 820.\n\n*   **Consider the offer from Player 1 in the prior round:** Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] which means they wanted me to have 1 unit of each item. This would be 1*93 + 1*51 + 1*61 + 1*63 + 1*20 = 288. With discount, this is 288 * 0.9 = 259.2, so this is worse than the current offer.\n\n*   **Consider the prior offer from Player 2:** Player 2 offered [0, 0, 5, 0, 0], which is the same as the current offer.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to construct an offer that is better than my outside offer of 820, after applying the discount factor (0.9). This means the offer needs to be worth more than 820/0.9 = 911.11 to me. Let's explore a few options, remembering that I have 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 10 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5 to start.\n\n    *   **Keep all of items 1 and 4, and the rest of Item 3**\n        Giving Player 2: [0, 3, 0, 0, 2]\n        Value to me: (3 * 93) + (3 * 61) + (4 * 63) = 279 + 183 + 252 = 714. This is way too low.\n\n    *   **Give Player 2 everything except all of items 1 and 4, and 2 units of Item 3.**\n        Giving Player 2: [0, 3, 8, 0, 2]\n        Value to me: (3 * 93) + (2 * 61) + (4 * 63) = 279 + 122 + 252 = 653. This is even lower.\n\n    *   **Let me try and get as much as possible from this negotiation:**\n        Giving Player 2 [0, 3, 6, 0, 2]\n        Value to me: (3 * 93) + (4 * 61) + (4 * 63) = 279 + 244 + 252 = 775. This is still too low.\n\n    *   **Let me try giving the other player the minimum of the values that are important to me and keeping what's most important.** I should give away all the items 2 and 5.\n        Giving Player 2: [0, 3, X, Y, 2]\n        Value to me: (3 * 93) + (10-X * 61) + (4-Y * 63) =\n        279 + 610 - 61X + 252 - 63Y = 1141 - 61X - 63Y\n        So, 1141 - 61X - 63Y > 911.11\n        229.89 > 61X + 63Y\n        If I have 2 Item 3 and 2 Item 4, then it will result in 61*2 + 63*2 = 248, which is over, so I can't do that.\n        If I give away all of Item 3 (10) and all of Item 4 (4).\n        Giving Player 2: [0, 3, 10, 4, 2]\n        Value to me: 0. Too low.\n\n        I will give 0 items of type 1 and type 4.\n        Giving Player 2: [0, 3, X, 0, 2]\n        Value to me: (3 * 93) + (10-X * 61) + (4 * 63) =\n        279 + 610 - 61X + 252 = 1141 - 61X\n\n        1141 - 61X > 911.11\n        229.89 > 61X\n        3.77 > X\n        So, give 3 to Item 3\n        Value to me: (3 * 93) + (7 * 61) + (4 * 63) = 279 + 427 + 252 = 958. This is above 911.11 so let's go with this.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\nThe current offer is bad (274.5 < 820). I should make a counteroffer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 3, 0, 2]}\n",

I will also take into account that the other agent also has the discount factor, and will probably try to counteroffer.\n   - I need to ensure that the value of the items I keep is greater than my outside offer.\n\nLet's try offering Player 2 half of each item where possible, rounding up or down as needed to make integer values.\n\nOffer to Player 2: [2, 1, 2, 1, 3]\nThis means I keep: [2, 1, 2, 2, 4]\n\nMy value for keeping [2, 1, 2, 2, 4]:\n2 * 32 + 1 * 21 + 2 * 6 + 2 * 59 + 4 * 69 = 64 + 21 + 12 + 118 + 276 = 491\n\nThis is less than my outside offer of 492. It is close, but I will try a slighly more aggressive offer.\n\nOffer to Player 2: [1, 0, 1, 1, 3]\nThis means I keep: [3, 2, 3, 2, 4]\n\nMy value for keeping [3, 2, 3, 2, 4]:\n3 * 32 + 2 * 21 + 3 * 6 + 2 * 59 + 4 * 69 = 96 + 42 + 18 + 118 + 276 = 550\n\nThis is more than my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 1, 3]}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 3, 1, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    32 x 0 + 21 x 0 + 6 x 3 + 59 x 1 + 69 x 6\n    which is 491 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 492. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This means I would receive 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n\nMy private values are:\n- Item 1: 4\n- Item 2: 57\n- Item 3: 35\n- Item 4: 46\n- Item 5: 81\n\nTherefore, the value of Player 1's current offer to me is:\n(0 * 4) + (0 * 57) + (1 * 35) + (0 * 46) + (1 * 81) = 0 + 0 + 35 + 0 + 81 = 116\n\nSince it is round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\nSo the present value of the offer is 116 * 0.9 = 104.4\n\nMy outside offer is 729. Since 104.4 < 729, accepting this offer is worse than walking away. I need to make a counteroffer that is better than my outside option when discounted.\n\nLet's consider making a counteroffer. I have the following items:\n- Item 1: 4 units\n- Item 2: 2 units\n- Item 3: 4 units\n- Item 4: 3 units\n- Item 5: 7 units\n\nLet's start by considering a counteroffer that gives Player 1 the items they offered me last round.\nIn round 1, I offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. This means I would receive:\n- Item 1: 4 - 1 = 3 units\n- Item 2: 2 - 1 = 1 units\n- Item 3: 4 - 1 = 3 units\n- Item 4: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n- Item 5: 7 - 1 = 6 units\n\nThe value of this to me would be:\n(3 * 4) + (1 * 57) + (3 * 35) + (2 * 46) + (6 * 81) = 12 + 57 + 105 + 92 + 486 = 752\n\nThe discounted value is 752 * 0.9 = 676.8\nThis is still less than my outside offer of 729, so it is not a good counteroffer.\n\nGiven that I only have one round left to make a counteroffer, and the discounted value decreases with each round, it seems unlikely I can reach an agreement better than my outside offer. I should try to get as much as possible to avoid walking.\nLet's consider giving very little to Player 1:\nCounteroffer: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nIf I make a counteroffer of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], it's as if I walked away as it's the last round.\nI will still try to make a reasonable counteroffer.\nLet's offer Player 1 [1, 0, 1, 0, 2]. Then I would receive:\n- Item 1: 3\n- Item 2: 2\n- Item 3: 3\n- Item 4: 3\n- Item 5: 5\nValue = (3*4) + (2*57) + (3*35) + (3*46) + (5*81) = 12 + 114 + 105 + 138 + 405 = 774\nDiscounted value = 774 * 0.9 = 696.6\nStill less than 729.\n\nConsidering it is the last round for a counteroffer, and my discounted values are all below my outside option. I'll stick to my outside option.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 530. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 530. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 786 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 5, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    67 x 0 + 39 x 1 + 68 x 5 + 57 x 1 + 31 x 3\n    which is 529 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 530. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 90% of the value of the same offer accepted in round 1, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 81% of the value of the same offer accepted in round 1.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - There is no current offer on the table.\n   - I need to consider potential counteroffers and their value to me.\n   - Any offer I make must be better than my outside offer of 530.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - Since there is no current offer, I need to propose an initial offer.\n   - I want to find an offer that maximizes my potential gain, considering the discount factor.\n   - I need to avoid the five mistakes outlined in the prompt.\n\nTo start, let's try to create an offer that gives Player 2 roughly half of the total value.

This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its value in round 1, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 0.9^2 = 0.81 times its value in round 1. This encourages reaching an agreement sooner rather than later.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - There is no current offer.\n   - I need to formulate an initial offer. I want to maximize my value while making it appealing enough for Player 2 to consider. I need to keep in mind that the discount factor encourages early agreement.\n   - Since my outside offer is 338, I must make sure I get at least this value.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nLet's try an offer where I give Player 2 half of all the items rounding down when the items are odd.\n\nOffer: [2, 2, 1, 1, 4]  (What I offer to Player 2)\nThis means I keep [2, 3, 2, 1, 4].

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 4, 3, 6, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    23 x 4 + 1 x 4 + 66 x 3 + 73 x 6 + 66 x 5\n    which is 1062 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1074. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This means waiting reduces the value by 10% per round.\n\n2)  **Assessing Offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** There is no current offer.\n\nLet's consider a potential counteroffer. Since I want to maximize my value, I should start by offering something that gives me a value higher than my outside offer. Offering nothing would result in Player 2 walking away, which I want to avoid in the first round. I need to propose an offer that Player 2 is likely to accept, but also one that is better than my outside offer.\n\nLet's start with trying to give Player 2 just a little bit of each item.\n\n*Offer 1: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]*\nThis means I keep [4, 3, 3, 5, 4]\n\nValue for me:\n4 * 23 + 3 * 1 + 3 * 66 + 5 * 73 + 4 * 66 = 92 + 3 + 198 + 365 + 264 = 922\n\nSince 922 < 1074, this offer is not good enough. I will not offer this.\n\n*Offer 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]*\nThis means I keep [5, 4, 4, 6, 5]\n\nValue for me:\n5 * 23 + 4 * 1 + 4 * 66 + 6 * 73 + 5 * 66 = 115 + 4 + 264 + 438 + 330 = 1151\n\nThis is my maximum possible value. I will not offer this.\n\nLet's try a fair offer (approximately equal split in value):\n\nTotal value of all the items is 1151. Half of that is approximately 575. So the other player's value needs to be at least this much.\n\nSince I don't know the other player's value, I need to make an estimate. A good strategy is to divide items proportionally to the *quantity* of each item, which will be acceptable to a wide range of player values.\n\nTotal units = 5 + 4 + 4 + 6 + 5 = 24\nSo I'll offer approximately n/24 of the total quantity of each item, where n is a variable to be chosen.\nFor example, if n = 12, I will offer approximately half of each item.\n\nOkay, so the approximate proportional split can be found by solving the equation \nMy Value + Other's value = 1151.\nLet's start by trying n = 12.\n\nOffer 3: [2, 2, 2, 3, 2]\nThis is a simple, reasonable offer, and the total number of items given is 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 2 = 11.\nThis means I keep [3, 2, 2, 3, 3]\n\nValue for me:\n3 * 23 + 2 * 1 + 2 * 66 + 3 * 73 + 3 * 66 = 69 + 2 + 132 + 219 + 198 = 620\n\nSince 620 < 1074, this offer is not good enough. I will not offer this.\n\nLet's try a slightly more aggressive offer:\nOffer 4: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nThis means I keep [4, 3, 3, 5, 4]\n\nValue for me:\n4 * 23 + 3 * 1 + 3 * 66 + 5 * 73 + 4 * 66 = 92 + 3 + 198 + 365 + 264 = 922\n\nStill not high enough. Let's try to give up the smallest value item I have.\nSince my value for item 2 is so small, I'm going to offer the 4 units of item 2 to the other player. And I'll offer 0 units of each other item.\n\nOffer 5: [0, 4, 0, 0, 0]\nThis means I keep [5, 0, 4, 6, 5]\n\nValue for me:\n5 * 23 + 0 * 1 + 4 * 66 + 6 * 73 + 5 * 66 = 115 + 0 + 264 + 438 + 330 = 1147\n\nStill not higher than 1074. Okay, I'll make this offer anyway.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 4, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

This means Player 1 is offering me 0 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n\nMy values for each item are: 59, 38, 98, 96, 43.\n\nTherefore, the value of this offer to me is:\n(0 * 59) + (4 * 38) + (0 * 98) + (0 * 96) + (0 * 43) = 0 + 152 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 152\n\nMy outside offer is 623. Since 152 is less than 623, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. I want to maximize my value, so I should aim to keep items that I value highly (items 3 and 4) and offer items that I value less (items 2 and 5). Item 1 is in the middle.\nSince this is the first round, there are two rounds of negotiation left, so I don't want to offer too much.\n\nHere's a possible counteroffer strategy:\nGive Player 1:\n- Most of item 2\n- A small portion of item 5\nKeep for myself:\n- Most of item 3\n- Most of item 4\n- Some of item 1.\nLet's try offering Player 1 half of each item where possible and more of item 2.\nCounteroffer: [2, 4, 2, 3, 2]\n\nThis means I keep:\n- 3 units of item 1 (3 * 59 = 177)\n- 0 units of item 2 (0 * 38 = 0)\n- 2 units of item 3 (2 * 98 = 196)\n- 3 units of item 4 (3 * 96 = 288)\n- 3 units of item 5 (3 * 43 = 129)\n\nTotal value to me: 177 + 0 + 196 + 288 + 129 = 790\n\nSince 790 is greater than my outside offer of 623, this counteroffer is potentially better than walking away, *before* considering Player 1's reaction and the discount factor in later rounds.\n\nGiven the difference between the current offer and the counteroffer and outside offer, a counteroffer is the best action here.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 4, 2, 3, 2]}\n```",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 1074. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1074. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 687 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 4, 3, 6, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    23 x 4 + 1 x 4 + 66 x 3 + 73 x 6 + 66 x 5\n    which is 1062 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1074. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 4, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 4, 2, 3, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 4, 2, 3, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n   - My outside offer value: 1074\n   - My item values: Item 1: 23, Item 2: 1, Item 3: 66, Item 4: 73, Item 5: 66\n   - Total item pool: 5 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means an agreement in round 2 is worth 0.9 times the value of the items, and an agreement in round 3 is worth 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 times the value of the items.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer:** I'm being offered [2, 4, 2, 3, 2]. This means I keep:\n      - Item 1: 5 - 2 = 3 units\n      - Item 2: 4 - 4 = 0 units\n      - Item 3: 4 - 2 = 2 units\n      - Item 4: 6 - 3 = 3 units\n      - Item 5: 5 - 2 = 3 units\n   - Value of accepting the current offer:\n      - 3 * 23 + 0 * 1 + 2 * 66 + 3 * 73 + 3 * 66 = 69 + 0 + 132 + 219 + 198 = 618\n   - Since this is round 2, the discounted value is 618 * 0.9 = 556.2.\n   - 556.2 < 1074\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find an offer that, when I keep the rest, is worth more than 1074.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   - Accepting the current offer is worth 556.2, which is much less than my outside offer of 1074.\n   - I should not accept the current offer.\n   - I need to craft a counteroffer that benefits me more than my outside offer.\n\nLet's try an extreme counteroffer first. What if I offer the other player nothing? In this case, I keep everything:\n- Item 1: 5 units * 23 = 115\n- Item 2: 4 units * 1 = 4\n- Item 3: 4 units * 66 = 264\n- Item 4: 6 units * 73 = 438\n- Item 5: 5 units * 66 = 330\nTotal Value = 115 + 4 + 264 + 438 + 330 = 1151\nRound 2 discount = 1151 * 0.9 = 1035.9\n\nThis is still less than my outside offer. Let's try this with round 3 discount\nRound 3 discount = 1151 * 0.81 = 932.31\n\nMy initial offer in round 1 was [0, 4, 0, 0, 0]. If I make the same offer again, the value is:\n- Item 1: 5 units * 23 = 115\n- Item 2: 0 units * 1 = 0\n- Item 3: 4 units * 66 = 264\n- Item 4: 6 units * 73 = 438\n- Item 5: 5 units * 66 = 330\nTotal Value = 115 + 0 + 264 + 438 + 330 = 1147\nRound 2 discount = 1147 * 0.9 = 1032.3\nRound 3 discount = 1147 * 0.81 = 929.07\n\nSince it's round 2, and the value is heavily discounted, it is best to walk away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 842. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player1, 2 units of each item (keeping 2 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 822 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 5, 4, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 5, 4, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the current offer and decide on the best action.\n\nThe current offer to me (Player 2) is [0, 5, 4, 0, 0]. This means I receive 0 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n\nMy private values are: 99 for item 1, 16 for item 2, 77 for item 3, 28 for item 4, 54 for item 5.\n\nLet's calculate the value of the current offer to me:\n- Item 1: 0 * 99 = 0\n- Item 2: 5 * 16 = 80\n- Item 3: 4 * 77 = 308\n- Item 4: 0 * 28 = 0\n- Item 5: 0 * 54 = 0\nTotal value = 0 + 80 + 308 + 0 + 0 = 388\n\nMy outside offer is 842.  Since 388 < 842, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. I want to keep as much of item 1, item 3, and item 5 as possible, as those have the highest value for me. I need to offer Player 1 something to make a deal worthwhile for them. Since there are only 3 rounds, I can't afford to make small incremental improvements to my offer.\n\nLet's try to come up with a split that's better than walking away.\nI have 3 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5.\n\nI'll make a counteroffer where I give Player 1 more of item 2 and item 4, which are less valuable to me. How about offering Player 1 all of item 2 and item 4?\n\nCounteroffer: [3, 0, 4, 0, 3] (This represents what I give to Player 1)\nWhat I keep: 0 of item 1, 5 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 6 of item 4, 0 of item 5\nValue to me: 0 * 99 + 5*16 + 0*77 + 6*28 + 0*54 = 0 + 80 + 0 + 168 + 0 = 248\nSince 248 * 0.9^(1-1) = 248 < 842, this counteroffer is clearly not worthwhile.\n\nLet me try an offer that gives them a bit of everything.\nCounteroffer: [1, 3, 2, 3, 1]\nWhat I keep: 2 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 3 of item 4, 2 of item 5\nValue to me: 2*99 + 2*16 + 2*77 + 3*28 + 2*54 = 198 + 32 + 154 + 84 + 108 = 576\nSince 576 < 842, this is still worse than my outside offer.\n\nI need to consider that I'm in round 1, and if I don't get significantly more value now I might as well walk.\n\nLet's just walk.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",
