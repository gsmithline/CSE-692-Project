Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 841. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 841. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 984 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 4, 3, 5, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    97 x 0 + 35 x 4 + 92 x 3 + 72 x 5 + 32 x 2\n    which is 840 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 841. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 3, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    81 x 0 + 35 x 2 + 70 x 3 + 23 x 0 + 23 x 1\n    which is 303 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 310. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 3, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    81 x 0 + 35 x 2 + 70 x 3 + 23 x 0 + 23 x 1\n    which is 303 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 310. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

I will offer Player 1 all of item 1 and all of item 4, plus one unit of item 5.\n\nSo my counteroffer would be: [7, 0, 0, 3, 1]\n\nThis means I would keep:\n*   0 units of item 1\n*   3 units of item 2\n*   5 units of item 3\n*   0 units of item 4\n*   5 units of item 5\n\nMy value would be:\n(0 * 16) + (3 * 83) + (5 * 96) + (0 * 29) + (5 * 86) = 0 + 249 + 480 + 0 + 430 = 1159\n\nSince 1159 is greater than my outside offer of 679, this seems like a worthwhile counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [7, 0, 0, 3, 1]}\n```",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 851. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 851. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 801 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 2, 5, 0, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    67 x 4 + 53 x 2 + 67 x 5 + 52 x 0 + 28 x 5\n    which is 849 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 851. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    46 x 0 + 73 x 0 + 7 x 1 + 42 x 0 + 30 x 0\n    which is 7 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 12. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 460. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 903 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 3, 3, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    96 x 1 + 84 x 0 + 58 x 3 + 59 x 3 + 4 x 3\n    which is 459 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 460. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

Since this is the first round, I should start with an offer that favors me but isn't ridiculous.\n\nLet me calculate the value of keeping most high-value items for myself:\n- If I offer Player 2 [1, 0, 1, 3, 3], keeping [6, 3, 2, 4, 0] for myself, my value would be:\n  * 6\u00d796 = 576 (item 1)\n  * 3\u00d784 = 252 (item 2)\n  * 2\u00d758 = 116 (item 3)\n  * 4\u00d759 = 236 (item 4)\n  * 0\u00d74 = 0 (item 5)\n  * Total: 1180\n\nThis is significantly better than my outside offer of 460.\n\nStep 3: Make a decision\nThe offer [1, 0, 1, 3, 3] to Player 2 gives them something while allowing me to keep most of my high-value items. It's much better than my outside offer (1180 > 460). I'm giving Player 2 the items that are worth less to me (especially item 5 which is only worth 4 per unit to me), and keeping most of the items that are valuable to me.\n\nLet me verify this doesn't violate any of the potential mistakes:\n- Not worse than a previous offer (this is my first offer)\n- Better for me than my outside offer (1180 > 460)\n- Not offering nothing or everything (giving Player 2 some items)\n- Not accepting a worse offer than my outside offer (not applicable)\n- Not walking away from a better offer (not applicable)\n\nThis seems like a reasonable initial offer that strongly favors me but gives Player 2 something to work with.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 3, 3]}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 987. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player1, 2 units of each item (keeping 2 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 870 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 1, 3, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 1, 3, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the current offer and decide on the best action.\n\nThe current offer to me is [3, 1, 3, 2, 0].

I need to decide whether to walk away or make a counteroffer. Let's consider a counteroffer.  I will aim to get closer to my outside offer.\n\nI have the following amounts of each item to allocate between myself and Player 1:\n* Item 1: 5 units\n* Item 2: 4 units\n* Item 3: 4 units\n* Item 4: 7 units\n* Item 5: 2 units\n\nI want to keep as much as possible while still trying to make Player 1 an offer they will accept. I will prioritize the items for which I have higher values, which are item 2 (89), item 5 (68), and item 1 (63). I will make an offer that values the items player 1 receives at slightly above what I am being offered now.\n\nRight now, player 1 is getting (from my perspective):\nItem 1: 5-3 = 2 units\nItem 2: 4-1 = 3 units\nItem 3: 4-3 = 1 unit\nItem 4: 7-2 = 5 units\nItem 5: 2-0 = 2 units\n\nLet's try an offer where I give player 1 a slightly better bundle:\nOffer: [2, 3, 1, 5, 2]\n\nIf I offer [2, 3, 1, 5, 2] to Player 1, then I receive:\nItem 1: 5-2 = 3 units.  Value = 3 * 63 = 189\nItem 2: 4-3 = 1 unit.  Value = 1 * 89 = 89\nItem 3: 4-1 = 3 units.  Value = 3 * 12 = 36\nItem 4: 7-5 = 2 units.  Value = 2 * 58 = 116\nItem 5: 2-2 = 0 units.  Value = 0 * 68 = 0\n\nTotal value = 189 + 89 + 36 + 116 + 0 = 430\n\nI can improve the value for myself.\nOffer: [1, 2, 0, 4, 1]\n\nIf I offer [1, 2, 0, 4, 1] to Player 1, then I receive:\nItem 1: 5-1 = 4 units.  Value = 4 * 63 = 252\nItem 2: 4-2 = 2 unit.  Value = 2 * 89 = 178\nItem 3: 4-0 = 4 units.  Value = 4 * 12 = 48\nItem 4: 7-4 = 3 units.  Value = 3 * 58 = 174\nItem 5: 2-1 = 1 units.  Value = 1 * 68 = 68\n\nTotal value = 252 + 178 + 48 + 174 + 68 = 720\n\nThis is better than the current offer of 430, but still far from my outside option of 987.\nLet's improve the value for me further:\nOffer: [0, 1, 0, 3, 0]\nIf I offer [0, 1, 0, 3, 0] to Player 1, then I receive:\nItem 1: 5-0 = 5 units.  Value = 5 * 63 = 315\nItem 2: 4-1 = 3 unit.  Value = 3 * 89 = 267\nItem 3: 4-0 = 4 units.  Value = 4 * 12 = 48\nItem 4: 7-3 = 4 units.  Value = 4 * 58 = 232\nItem 5: 2-0 = 2 units.  Value = 2 * 68 = 136\n\nTotal value = 315 + 267 + 48 + 232 + 136 = 998\n\nThis is better than my outside option!\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 3, 0]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 2, 3, 3, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    36 x 1 + 52 x 2 + 17 x 3 + 64 x 3 + 60 x 2\n    which is 503 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 504. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 1, 3, 2, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 0, 3, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 3, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Let me try a slightly revised offer that might be more appealing to Player 2 while still keeping my value above my outside offer.\n   \n   If I offer [3, 2, 3, 3, 0] to Player 2, I would keep [2, 2, 1, 4, 2].\n   \n   Let me calculate the value of what I'd keep:\n   - 2 \u00d7 36 = 72 (item 1)\n   - 2 \u00d7 52 = 104 (item 2)\n   - 1 \u00d7 17 = 17 (item 3)\n   - 4 \u00d7 64 = 256 (item 4)\n   - 2 \u00d7 60 = 120 (item 5)\n   \n   Total value = 569\n   With discount: 569 \u00d7 0.9 = 512.1\n\n   This is still above my outside offer (504), and might be more acceptable to Player 2 since I'm giving up more of item 4, which they seem to want based on their counteroffer.\n\nTherefore, I'll make this counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 2, 3, 3, 0]}",

Since it is round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.  Therefore, the present value of accepting the current offer is 577 * 0.9 = 519.3.\n\nMy outside offer is 987. Since 519.3 < 987, accepting the offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNow I should think about a counteroffer.

Let's try and extract more value.\n\nSince this is round 2, I need to seriously consider my outside option.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 487. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 900 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 5, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    47 x 0 + 67 x 0 + 98 x 1 + 36 x 5 + 52 x 4\n    which is 486 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 487. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1107. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player1, 2 units of each item (keeping 2 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 858 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 3, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 2, 3, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the current offer and decide on the best action.\n\nThe current offer to me is [2, 2, 3, 1, 1]. This means Player 1 is offering me:\n- 2 units of item 1\n- 2 units of item 2\n- 3 units of item 3\n- 1 unit of item 4\n- 1 unit of item 5\n\nMy private values are:\n- Item 1: 37\n- Item 2: 84\n- Item 3: 82\n- Item 4: 74\n- Item 5: 9\n\nSo, the value of the current offer to me is:\n(2 * 37) + (2 * 84) + (3 * 82) + (1 * 74) + (1 * 9) = 74 + 168 + 246 + 74 + 9 = 571\n\nMy outside offer is 1107.\n\nSince 571 is significantly less than my outside offer of 1107, I should not accept the current offer.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. To maximize my value, I want to keep as much of the items with high value to me (items 2, 3, and 4) as possible. I need to give Player 1 something to make the deal attractive to them.\n\nLet's start with a counteroffer where I give Player 1 a majority of the items that I don't value as much, namely items 1 and 5. Also I will try to keep more of the items that I value.\n\nCounteroffer: [4, 1, 2, 1, 1]\n\nThis means I would give player 1:\n- 4 units of item 1\n- 1 unit of item 2\n- 2 units of item 3\n- 1 unit of item 4\n- 1 unit of item 5\n\nThis leaves me with:\n- 2 units of item 1\n- 3 units of item 2\n- 4 units of item 3\n- 3 units of item 4\n- 1 unit of item 5\n\nThe value of this to me is:\n(2 * 37) + (3 * 84) + (4 * 82) + (3 * 74) + (1 * 9) = 74 + 252 + 328 + 222 + 9 = 885\n\n885 < 1107, so this counter offer is not very good.\n\nHow about I propose giving them all of item 1 and 5, and even amounts of the other items?\n[6, 2, 3, 2, 2]\n\nI would have:\n- 0 units of item 1\n- 2 units of item 2\n- 3 units of item 3\n- 2 units of item 4\n- 0 units of item 5\n\nValue:\n(0 * 37) + (2 * 84) + (3 * 82) + (2 * 74) + (0 * 9) = 0 + 168 + 246 + 148 + 0 = 562\n\nThis is also not better than my outside offer.\n\nGiven that it is round 1, I will make a counteroffer that aims to get me close to my outside value while also giving Player 1 some value. Let's try:\n\n[3, 1, 2, 1, 1]\nThis leaves me with:\n3 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 3 of item 4, 1 of item 5\n\nMy Value:\n3*37 + 3*84 + 4*82 + 3*74 + 1*9 = 111 + 252 + 328 + 222 + 9 = 922\n\nStill not enough. I'll walk.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 3, 3, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    93 x 0 + 50 x 1 + 80 x 3 + 97 x 3 + 50 x 2\n    which is 681 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 682. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

The second offer [3, 2, 2, 1, 1] is more balanced while still giving me good value (1003).\n\nI'll go with the first offer [2, 2, 1, 1, 1] since:\n1.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 9, 6, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    15 x 0 + 85 x 1 + 29 x 9 + 16 x 6 + 12 x 3\n    which is 478 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 479. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

I need to keep in mind that this is round 1, and there are two more rounds to potentially negotiate. I want to make a reasonable counteroffer that gives player 1 enough value to consider it, but also leaves me with a value greater than my outside offer of 852. It's important to think about what Player 1 likely values each item as, however I do not know their values. Since I only have a single unit of Item 3, I want to offer 0 units of this to Player 1.\n\nLet's try offering Player 1:\n*   3 units of item 1\n*   1 unit of item 2\n*   0 unit of item 3\n*   5 units of item 4\n*   0 unit of item 5\n\nThis would leave me with:\n*   2 units of item 1\n*   2 units of item 2\n*   1 unit of item 3\n*   2 units of item 4\n*   2 units of item 5\n\nThe value to me would be:\n(2 * 53) + (2 * 95) + (1 * 37) + (2 * 25) + (2 * 66) = 106 + 190 + 37 + 50 + 132 = 515\n\nThis is still well below my outside option, but it is a starting point.\n\nI am going to propose giving the other player:\n*   0 units of item 1\n*   0 unit of item 2\n*   0 unit of item 3\n*   0 units of item 4\n*   0 unit of item 5\n\nThis gives them nothing.\n\nThe value to me would be:\n(5 * 53) + (3 * 95) + (1 * 37) + (7 * 25) + (2 * 66) = 265 + 285 + 37 + 175 + 132 = 894\n\nThis is only marginally better than my outside option. I am unsure of what their values are, so I am going to offer them the following:\n* 2 units of item 1\n* 0 unit of item 2\n* 0 unit of item 3\n* 5 units of item 4\n* 0 unit of item 5\n\nThis gives me:\n*   3 units of item 1\n*   3 units of item 2\n*   1 unit of item 3\n*   2 units of item 4\n*   2 units of item 5\nThe value to me would be:\n(3 * 53) + (3 * 95) + (1 * 37) + (2 * 25) + (2 * 66) = 159 + 285 + 37 + 50 + 132 = 663\n\nThis is less than my outside option of 852.\n\nLet's try a different offer, where I offer them almost everything:\n* 4 units of item 1\n* 2 unit of item 2\n* 0 unit of item 3\n* 6 units of item 4\n* 1 unit of item 5\n\nThis gives me:\n*   1 units of item 1\n*   1 units of item 2\n*   1 unit of item 3\n*   1 units of item 4\n*   1 units of item 5\nThe value to me would be:\n(1 * 53) + (1 * 95) + (1 * 37) + (1 * 25) + (1 * 66) = 53 + 95 + 37 + 25 + 66 = 276\n\nThis is a terrible offer.\n\nI will offer player 1:\n* 1 units of item 1\n* 0 unit of item 2\n* 0 unit of item 3\n* 2 units of item 4\n* 0 unit of item 5\n\nThis leaves me with:\n* 4 units of item 1\n* 3 units of item 2\n* 1 unit of item 3\n* 5 units of item 4\n* 2 units of item 5\nThe value to me would be:\n(4 * 53) + (3 * 95) + (1 * 37) + (5 * 25) + (2 * 66) = 212 + 285 + 37 + 125 + 132 = 791\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 2, 0]}\n```",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 189. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 189. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 930 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 0, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    52 x 1 + 95 x 1 + 45 x 0 + 78 x 0 + 40 x 1\n    which is 187 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 189. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 1, 2, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 0, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 0, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 1, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    18 x 0 + 77 x 3 + 55 x 1 + 59 x 1 + 74 x 1\n    which is 419 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 420. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

I should try to keep most of the high-value items while offering enough to make a deal possible.\n\nMy highest value items are:\n1. Item 2 (77 per unit)\n2. Item 5 (74 per unit)\n3. Item 4 (59 per unit)\n4. Item 3 (55 per unit)\n5. Item 1 (18 per unit)\n\nI should try to keep most of the high-value items while giving away more of the low-value items.\n\nLet me consider offering:\n- 3 units of item 1 (keeping 1)\n- 1 unit of item 2 (keeping 4)\n- 2 units of item 3 (keeping 2)\n- 0 units of item 4 (keeping 2)\n- 2 units of item 5 (keeping 5)\n\nValue calculation for what I keep:\n- 1 unit of item 1: 1 \u00d7 18 = 18\n- 4 units of item 2: 4 \u00d7 77 = 308\n- 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 55 = 110\n- 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 59 = 118\n- 5 units of item 5: 5 \u00d7 74 = 370\nTotal value = 924, which is well above my outside offer of 420.\n\nStep 3: Making a decision\nThis offer allows me to keep most of my high-value items while offering the other player some items. The value of what I keep (924) is significantly higher than my outside offer (420), so this is a good starting position.\n\nSince this is a negotiation, I might need to compromise in future rounds, but starting with this position gives me room to adjust while maintaining a good outcome for myself.\n\nTherefore, my counteroffer is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 1, 2, 0, 2]}",

This means I would receive:\n\n*   3 units of item 1\n*   1 unit of item 2\n*   2 units of item 3\n*   0 units of item 4\n*   2 units of item 5\n\nMy values for these items are: 94, 43, 43, 14, 45\n\nSo, the total value of the offer to me is:\n(3 * 94) + (1 * 43) + (2 * 43) + (0 * 14) + (2 * 45) = 282 + 43 + 86 + 0 + 90 = 501\n\nNow I need to compare this value (501) to my outside offer (581).

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items.

Let's see what happens if I accept the offer made by Player 2 in round 1.\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 2, 1, 1, 3] means I had 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\nValue = (1*94) + (2*43) + (1*43) + (1*14) + (3*45) = 94 + 86 + 43 + 14 + 135 = 372.\nThe discounted value of that offer is 372 * 0.9 = 334.8.\n\nLet's try and improve on the current offer slightly. I need to offer Player 1 less of the items I value less. Let's offer player 1:\n[3, 3, 3, 1, 4]\n\nThis would leave me with:\n1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 3 units of item 5.\nMy value is 94 + 86 + 43 + 14 + 135 = 372.\nDiscounted value: 372 * 0.9 = 334.8. This is worse than my outside option.\n\nGiven my outside offer is significantly better than the current offer, and this is round 2, there is minimal time left to try for a better deal. I should walk away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 254. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 771 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 2, 1, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    72 x 2 + 50 x 2 + 9 x 1 + 56 x 0 + 70 x 0\n    which is 253 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 254. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Since the current offer (333) is significantly less than my outside offer (709), I should not accept.\n\nNow, let's consider a counteroffer.

Since there are only 3 rounds, I might want to make a relatively aggressive offer to see if Player 1 will accept.\n\nHere's what I have: 6 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\nI value item 2 the most (84), followed by item 1 (50), item 5 (33), item 4 (25), and item 3 (20).\n\nA possible counteroffer could be to give Player 1 everything except most of item 2, some of item 1, and possibly a small amount of item 5.

My private values are 50, 84, 20, 25, and 33 for items 1 through 5. My outside offer is 709. The discount factor is 0.9.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the value of the current offer to me:\n- Item 1: 3 units * 50 = 150\n- Item 2: 2 units * 84 = 168\n- Item 3: 2 units * 20 = 40\n- Item 4: 2 units * 25 = 50\n- Item 5: 0 units * 33 = 0\nTotal value of the offer = 150 + 168 + 40 + 50 + 0 = 408\n\nNow, I need to consider the discount factor. This is round 2, so the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\nPresent value of the offer = 408 * 0.9 = 367.2\n\nSince my outside offer is 709, and the present value of the current offer is 367.2, accepting the offer is much worse than walking away. Therefore, I need to make a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer when discounted. The total number of each item is 6, 3, 2, 4, 2. The value of all the items to me is (6 * 50) + (3 * 84) + (2 * 20) + (4 * 25) + (2 * 33) = 300 + 252 + 40 + 100 + 66 = 758.\nIf I keep all the items, the value is 758. Discounting gives a present value of 758*0.9 = 682.2\n\nTo make a beneficial counteroffer, I want to obtain a discounted amount greater than my outside offer value. Let me think what the ideal amounts to give would be to Player 1... My strategy is to offer Player 1 a very small amount so that my value would be significantly greater than my outside offer. Let's offer the other player [2,1,1,1,1].

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 3, 1, 3, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    94 x 3 + 39 x 3 + 21 x 1 + 11 x 3 + 15 x 4\n    which is 513 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 514. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

So, any offer I accept must be worth at least 608.\n\nLet's start by proposing an even split, which would give me:\n* Item 1: 1.5 units\n* Item 2: 2 units\n* Item 3: 1.5 units\n* Item 4: 2.5 units\n* Item 5: 2 units\n\nValue of even split:\n* Item 1: 1.5 * 59 = 88.5\n* Item 2: 2 * 34 = 68\n* Item 3: 1.5 * 37 = 55.5\n* Item 4: 2.5 * 71 = 177.5\n* Item 5: 2 * 20 = 40\n* Total value = 88.5 + 68 + 55.5 + 177.5 + 40 = 429.5\n\nThis is still far below my outside offer, so I will propose an offer that gives me more. Let's try to get the following:\n* Item 1: 3 units\n* Item 2: 4 units\n* Item 3: 1 units\n* Item 4: 3 units\n* Item 5: 2 units\n\nThis means I will offer Player 1:\n* Item 1: 0 units\n* Item 2: 0 units\n* Item 3: 2 units\n* Item 4: 2 units\n* Item 5: 2 units\n\nValue to me:\n* Item 1: 3 * 59 = 177\n* Item 2: 4 * 34 = 136\n* Item 3: 1 * 37 = 37\n* Item 4: 3 * 71 = 213\n* Item 5: 2 * 20 = 40\n* Total: 177 + 136 + 37 + 213 + 40 = 603\n\nThis is very close to my outside offer. If I offered myself 4 units of Item 4 instead of 3, and gave only 1 unit of Item 4 to Player 1:\n* Item 1: 3 * 59 = 177\n* Item 2: 4 * 34 = 136\n* Item 3: 1 * 37 = 37\n* Item 4: 4 * 71 = 284\n* Item 5: 2 * 20 = 40\n* Total: 177 + 136 + 37 + 284 + 40 = 674\n\nI offer Player 1:\n* Item 1: 0 units\n* Item 2: 0 units\n* Item 3: 2 units\n* Item 4: 1 units\n* Item 5: 2 units\n\nThis is clearly better than my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 2, 1, 2]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 3, 1, 3, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    94 x 3 + 39 x 3 + 21 x 1 + 11 x 3 + 15 x 4\n    which is 513 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 514. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 495. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player1, 2 units of each item (keeping 2 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 609 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 4, 1, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 4, 1, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. I am Player 2. The current offer on the table is [0, 4, 1, 0, 1]. This means Player 1 is offering me 0 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n\nMy private values are:\n- Item 1: 81\n- Item 2: 23\n- Item 3: 73\n- Item 4: 17\n- Item 5: 9\n\nMy outside offer value is 495.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the current offer to me:\n- 0 units of item 1: 0 * 81 = 0\n- 4 units of item 2: 4 * 23 = 92\n- 1 unit of item 3: 1 * 73 = 73\n- 0 units of item 4: 0 * 17 = 0\n- 1 unit of item 5: 1 * 9 = 9\nTotal value of current offer: 0 + 92 + 73 + 0 + 9 = 174\n\nSince 174 is much less than my outside offer of 495, I should not accept this offer.\n\nNow, let's consider a counteroffer. I have the following items:\n- 3 units of item 1\n- 5 units of item 2\n- 2 units of item 3\n- 1 unit of item 4\n- 5 units of item 5\n\nI need to decide how many of each item to offer to Player 1. My goal is to maximize my value, considering the discount factor in later rounds. I want to get at least 495 value at the end.\n\nSince this is round 1, the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 1.\n\nLet's calculate the total possible value if I kept all the items for myself:\n- 3 units of item 1: 3 * 81 = 243\n- 5 units of item 2: 5 * 23 = 115\n- 2 units of item 3: 2 * 73 = 146\n- 1 unit of item 4: 1 * 17 = 17\n- 5 units of item 5: 5 * 9 = 45\nTotal value if I keep everything: 243 + 115 + 146 + 17 + 45 = 566\n\nI need to offer something to Player 1 that is attractive, but still leaves me with more than 495. Item 2 has my lowest value.\n\nLet's try offering Player 1 all the items that I value less (item 2, item 4, and item 5) in exchange for items 1 and 3. I value item 1 and item 3 the most.\n\nLet's start by offering them everything except item 1 and item 3. In that case the offer will be [3, 5, 2, 1, 5].\nValue to me: 0.\n\nIf I offer them 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 0 of item 4, and 0 of item 5. Then the value of the offer for me is 566. However, this is unlikely to be accepted.\n\nLet's create a counteroffer such that I keep 2 units of item 1 and 1 unit of item 3. Offer [1, 5, 1, 1, 5].\nMy value: 2*81 + 1*73 = 162 + 73 = 235.\nToo low.\n\nLet's try offering: [0, 4, 0, 0, 4]. This means I have: 3, 1, 2, 1, 1.\nValue: 3*81 + 1*23 + 2*73 + 1*17 + 1*9 = 243+23+146+17+9 = 438.\nStill lower than my outside offer.\n\nI should counteroffer in a way that leaves me a value higher than 495.\n\nLet's offer [0, 5, 1, 1, 5]. My items are 3, 0, 1, 0, 0. My value: 3*81 + 1*73 = 243 + 73 = 316.\nThis is lower than my outside offer.\n\nLet's make a more generous offer. Offer [1, 4, 0, 0, 4]. That means I keep 2 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 1 of item 5. My value is: 2*81 + 1*23 + 2*73 + 1*17 + 1*9 = 162 + 23 + 146 + 17 + 9 = 357.\nStill not good enough.\n\nOkay. Given the situation and the high outside offer, I should be conservative and offer something that guarantees me at least close to the outside offer. Let's try to aim for 495.\n\nLet's offer [0,0,0,0,0]. My value is 566.\n\nLet's offer [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]. My value is 566 - 23 = 543.\nLet's offer [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]. My value is 566 - 46 = 520.\nLet's offer [0, 3, 0, 0, 0]. My value is 566 - 69 = 497.\n\nLet's offer them [0, 3, 0, 0, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 1, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    83 x 1 + 4 x 1 + 44 x 1 + 42 x 0 + 72 x 1\n    which is 203 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 204. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 4, 1, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 3, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 3, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 306. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 306. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 648 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 2, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    8 x 0 + 15 x 1 + 97 x 2 + 84 x 1 + 12 x 1\n    which is 305 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 306. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best course of action for Player 2.\n\n**Current Situation:**\n\n*   **Round:** 2\n*   **Current Offer to Player 2:** \\[1, 1, 0, 0, 5]\n*   **Player 2's Values:** item 1: 55, item 2: 46, item 3: 75, item 4: 36, item 5: 17\n*   **Player 2's Outside Offer:** 526\n*   **Discount Factor:** 0.9\n\n**Evaluating the Current Offer:**\n\nLet's calculate the value of the current offer to Player 2:\n\n*   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 55 = 55\n*   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 46 = 46\n*   0 units of item 3: 0 * 75 = 0\n*   0 units of item 4: 0 * 36 = 0\n*   5 units of item 5: 5 * 17 = 85\n\nTotal value of the offer = 55 + 46 + 0 + 0 + 85 = 186\n\nSince it's round 2, we need to discount this value: 186 * 0.9^(2-1) = 186 * 0.9 = 167.4\n\nThe discounted value of the current offer (167.4) is significantly less than Player 2's outside offer (526). Therefore, accepting the current offer is not a good option.\n\n**Considering a Counteroffer:**\n\nWe need to determine a counteroffer that is better than walking away with the outside offer and that Player 1 might accept. Let's consider Player 1's offer in round 1 of \\[2, 0, 0, 1, 5]. This seems close to player 1 wanting almost all of item 1 and 5.\n\nLet's consider the total number of each item available:\n* item 1: 2\n* item 2: 1\n* item 3: 3\n* item 4: 5\n* item 5: 7\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where player 2 gets the remaining items not in the round 1 counteroffer.\n\nThe round 1 counteroffer to player 1 was: \\[2, 0, 0, 1, 5]\nThus player 2 had [0, 1, 3, 4, 2]. The value of this is 1 * 46 + 3 * 75 + 4 * 36 + 2 * 17 = 46 + 225 + 144 + 34 = 449.\n\nThis discounted is 449 * 0.9 = 404.1 which is still less than the outside offer.\n\nLet's attempt to give player 1 almost everything except for item 3, since item 3 has the highest value to player 2.\n\nNew Counteroffer: \\[2, 1, 0, 5, 7]\nValue to Player 2 would then be 3 * 75 = 225.\nDiscounted is 225 * 0.9 = 202.5 which is still bad.\n\nLet's try a slightly more balanced counteroffer.\n\nCounteroffer: [1, 0, 1, 2, 3]\n\nValue to player 2 would be (2-1)*55 + (1-0)*46 + (3-1)*75 + (5-2)*36 + (7-3)*17 = 55 + 46 + 150 + 108 + 68 = 427\nDiscounted is 427 * 0.9 = 384.3\n\nLet's give player 1 one item of item 3.\nCounteroffer: [1, 0, 2, 2, 3]\n\nValue to player 2 would be (2-1)*55 + (1-0)*46 + (3-2)*75 + (5-2)*36 + (7-3)*17 = 55 + 46 + 75 + 108 + 68 = 352\nDiscounted is 352 * 0.9 = 316.8\n\nLet's try to aim for just above the outside option. Let's lower values of 1 and 5.\nCounteroffer: [1, 0, 1, 3, 4]\n\nValue to player 2 would be (2-1)*55 + (1-0)*46 + (3-1)*75 + (5-3)*36 + (7-4)*17 = 55 + 46 + 150 + 72 + 51 = 374.\nDiscounted is 374 * 0.9 = 336.6\n\nCounteroffer: [1, 0, 0, 3, 4]\n\nValue to player 2 would be (2-1)*55 + (1-0)*46 + (3-0)*75 + (5-3)*36 + (7-4)*17 = 55 + 46 + 225 + 72 + 51 = 449\nDiscounted is 449 * 0.9 = 404.1\n\nCounteroffer: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nValue to player 2 would be (2-0)*55 + (1-0)*46 + (3-0)*75 + (5-0)*36 + (7-0)*17 = 110 + 46 + 225 + 180 + 119 = 680\nDiscounted is 680 * 0.9 = 612\n\n**Decision:**\n\nThe best option is to offer player 1 everything.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 3, 5, 7]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 2, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party.

Since the value of the current offer (381) is significantly less than my outside offer, I should not accept.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. I have the following amounts of items:\n* Item 1: 5\n* Item 2: 10\n* Item 3: 4\n* Item 4: 4\n* Item 5: 3\n\nTo determine a good counteroffer, I want to keep the items that I value most.

Let's consider offering player 1 the following:\n* Item 1: 0\n* Item 2: 5\n* Item 3: 0\n* Item 4: 0\n* Item 5: 0\n\nThis would mean I keep:\n* Item 1: 5\n* Item 2: 5\n* Item 3: 4\n* Item 4: 4\n* Item 5: 3\n\nThe value of this to me would be:\n(5 * 81) + (5 * 54) + (4 * 23) + (4 * 56) + (3 * 72) = 405 + 270 + 92 + 224 + 216 = 1207\n\nSince 1207 > 961, this looks like a decent offer.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 10, 3, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    26 x 1 + 48 x 10 + 20 x 3 + 25 x 1 + 6 x 3\n    which is 609 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 610. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This means I would get:\n- Item 1: 5 - 0 = 5 units\n- Item 2: 10 - 1 = 9 units\n- Item 3: 4 - 0 = 4 units\n- Item 4: 4 - 0 = 4 units\n- Item 5: 3 - 2 = 1 unit\n\nMy value for this offer is:\n(5 * 81) + (9 * 54) + (4 * 23) + (4 * 56) + (1 * 72) = 405 + 486 + 92 + 224 + 72 = 1279\n\nSince this is round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.  So the present value of this offer is 1279 * 0.9 = 1151.1.\n\nMy outside offer is 961.  Since 1151.1 is greater than 961, accepting is better than walking away *at this moment*.\n\nNow, let's consider if a counteroffer is better. We are in round 2, so if I make a counteroffer, and it is not accepted, I have to walk away in round 3.\n\nHere's my reasoning for making a counteroffer:\nPlayer 1's current offer is quite unfavorable to them. I get almost everything. Let's consider making an offer that is more fair, but still advantageous for me. I will make an offer that gives Player 1 slightly more than they are currently getting (while still giving me enough to be better than walking away).\n\nHere's a possible counteroffer: [1, 2, 1, 1, 2]\n\nIf I offer Player 1 [1, 2, 1, 1, 2], then I get:\n- Item 1: 5 - 1 = 4 units\n- Item 2: 10 - 2 = 8 units\n- Item 3: 4 - 1 = 3 units\n- Item 4: 4 - 1 = 3 units\n- Item 5: 3 - 2 = 1 unit\n\nMy value for this is:\n(4 * 81) + (8 * 54) + (3 * 23) + (3 * 56) + (1 * 72) = 324 + 432 + 69 + 168 + 72 = 1065\n\nThe discounted value is 1065 * 0.9 = 958.5\n\n958.5 is less than my walkaway value of 961, so this would be a bad move.\n\nSince accepting gives me 1151.1 and walking gives me 961.0, I should accept.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 472. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 582 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 2, 1, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    3 x 0 + 20 x 0 + 96 x 2 + 7 x 1 + 68 x 4\n    which is 471 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 472. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the offer and determine my best course of action.\n\nThe current offer on the table for me is: [4, 2, 0, 4, 1].  This means Player 1 is offering me 4 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n\nMy values per unit are: 19, 73, 84, 95, 89.\n\nLet's calculate the value of this offer to me:\n*   4 units of item 1: 4 * 19 = 76\n*   2 units of item 2: 2 * 73 = 146\n*   0 units of item 3: 0 * 84 = 0\n*   4 units of item 4: 4 * 95 = 380\n*   1 unit of item 5: 1 * 89 = 89\n\nTotal value of the offer: 76 + 146 + 0 + 380 + 89 = 691\n\nMy outside offer is 1359. Since 691 < 1359, accepting this offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNow, I need to consider making a counteroffer. To make a good counteroffer, I need to figure out how to divide the items to get a value greater than 1359, while also making the deal attractive enough for Player 1 to accept. I will start by offering what Player 1 originally asked for, and see if there are any items to shift around.\n\nPlayer 1's original offer gave Player 1: [4, 2, 0, 4, 1]\nTherefore player 1 asked for 5 - 4 = 1 item 1\n6 - 2 = 4 item 2\n2 - 0 = 2 item 3\n5 - 4 = 1 item 4\n4 - 1 = 3 item 5\n\nMy outside option is very high compared to the initial offer. A reasonable starting point for a counteroffer might be splitting things more evenly, but it's unlikely Player 1 would accept that. Perhaps a slight improvement on the current offer could be enough. I will try to take a little more of my highest value items, items 4 and 5.\n\nLet's consider offering Player 1: [3, 4, 1, 0, 2]. This leaves me with:\n2 units of item 1: 2 * 19 = 38\n2 units of item 2: 2 * 73 = 146\n1 units of item 3: 1 * 84 = 84\n5 units of item 4: 5 * 95 = 475\n2 units of item 5: 2 * 89 = 178\nTotal value = 38 + 146 + 84 + 475 + 178 = 921\nThis is still significantly less than my outside offer.\n\nLet's calculate what Player 1 gets from this offer:\n3 * Player 1 Value 1 + 4 * Player 1 Value 2 + 1 * Player 1 Value 3 + 0 * Player 1 Value 4 + 2 * Player 1 Value 5\nI don't know Player 1's values. It's hard to make a good offer.\n\nGiven the large difference between my value for the initial offer (691) and my outside offer (1359), and the limited number of rounds, I should aim for a deal that gives me close to my outside offer. Without knowing Player 1's value, it's hard to guess what they'd accept. It's probably too risky to propose an offer that would be very favorable to me.\n\nLet me try a more conservative counteroffer, giving Player 1 slightly more value: [2, 3, 1, 2, 1]\n\nThis leaves me with:\n3 units of item 1: 3 * 19 = 57\n3 units of item 2: 3 * 73 = 219\n1 unit of item 3: 1 * 84 = 84\n3 units of item 4: 3 * 95 = 285\n3 units of item 5: 3 * 89 = 267\nTotal value = 57 + 219 + 84 + 285 + 267 = 912\n\nStill too low. I'm highly likely to walk away.\n\nI'll try another counter offer, this time trying to get at least close to my outside option.\nOffer Player 1: [1, 2, 0, 1, 0]\nThis leaves me with:\n4 units of item 1: 4 * 19 = 76\n4 units of item 2: 4 * 73 = 292\n2 units of item 3: 2 * 84 = 168\n4 units of item 4: 4 * 95 = 380\n4 units of item 5: 4 * 89 = 356\nTotal value = 76 + 292 + 168 + 380 + 356 = 1272\n\nStill less than 1359.\n\nIt's risky, but my outside offer is pretty good.\nI'll counteroffer again.\n\nOffer Player 1: [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\nThis leaves me with:\n5 units of item 1: 5 * 19 = 95\n5 units of item 2: 5 * 73 = 365\n2 units of item 3: 2 * 84 = 168\n5 units of item 4: 5 * 95 = 475\n4 units of item 5: 4 * 89 = 356\nTotal value = 95 + 365 + 168 + 475 + 356 = 1459\n\nThis is greater than my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 472. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 582 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 2, 1, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    3 x 0 + 20 x 0 + 96 x 2 + 7 x 1 + 68 x 4\n    which is 471 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 472. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [4, 2, 0, 4, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Counteroffering risks further discounting and possibly losing this favorable deal.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 1284. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1284. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 777 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [9, 3, 5, 4, 8] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    7 x 9 + 82 x 3 + 34 x 5 + 72 x 4 + 64 x 8\n    which is 1279 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1284. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "I'll analyze this negotiation step by step:\n\n1) Current situation:\n   - My outside offer value: 1284\n   - My item values: Item 1: 7, Item 2: 82, Item 3: 34, Item 4: 72, Item 5: 64\n   - Total pool: 9 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 8 units of item 5\n   - Discount factor: \u03b3 = 0.9\n   - We're in round 2, so any deal will be worth 0.9 times its original value\n\n2) Value assessment:\n   - Current offer to me: [4, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n   - If I accept this offer, I would get:\n     - 4 units of item 1: 4 \u00d7 7 = 28\n     - 0 units of item 2: 0 \u00d7 82 = 0\n     - 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 34 = 34\n     - 0 units of item 4: 0 \u00d7 72 = 0\n     - 0 units of item 5: 0 \u00d7 64 = 0\n     - Total: 62 \u00d7 0.9 (round 2 discount) = 55.8\n   - This is much worse than my outside offer of 1284\n\n3) Counteroffer calculation:\n   - I need to keep enough items to exceed my outside offer value of 1284\n   - Let me calculate a favorable division (what I keep):\n     - Keep all of item 2 (high value): 3 \u00d7 82 = 246\n     - Keep all of item 4 (high value): 4 \u00d7 72 = 288\n     - Keep all of item 5 (medium-high value): 8 \u00d7 64 = 512\n     - Keep 5 units of item 3: 5 \u00d7 34 = 170\n     - Keep 5 units of item 1: 5 \u00d7 7 = 35\n     - Total value for me: 1251\n   \n   - This means I would offer Player 2:\n     - 4 units of item 1\n     - 0 units of item 2\n     - 1 unit of item 3\n     - 0 units of item 4\n     - 0 units of item 5\n\n   - With round 2 discount (0.9), my value would be: 1251 \u00d7 0.9 = 1125.9\n   - This is still less than my outside offer, but the difference isn't drastic\n\n4) Refining my counteroffer:\n   - I need to keep more items to exceed my outside offer after discount\n   - Let me try keeping 6 units of item 1: 6 \u00d7 7 = 42\n   - And keeping all other items as before\n   - New total for me: 1251 + 7 = 1258\n   - With discount: 1258 \u00d7 0.9 = 1132.2\n   \n   - This means I would offer Player 2:\n     - 3 units of item 1\n     - 0 units of item 2\n     - 1 unit of item 3\n     - 0 units of item 4\n     - 0 units of item 5\n\n   - This is still below my outside offer after discount\n\n5) Decision:\n   - Even with an optimized division, after the round 2 discount, I can't exceed my outside offer value\n   - The best course of action is to WALK and take my outside offer of 1284\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",
