Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 200. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 200. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 567 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

Since this is round 1, the discount factor doesn't affect the current round as (r-1) = 0, and any power of zero is 1. Therefore, the values aren't discounted in the first round.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer**: The current offer on the table is [2, 1, 1, 4, 1], meaning I would receive:\n\n  - 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 74 = 148\n  - 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 2 = 2\n  - 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 42 = 42\n  - 4 units of item 4: 4 \u00d7 72 = 288\n  - 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 7 = 7\n\n  Total value of the current offer: 148 + 2 + 42 + 288 + 7 = 487\n\n- **Comparison with Outside Offer**:\n  - Current Offer: 487\n  - Outside Offer: 421\n\nThe current offer is better than my outside offer.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\n- **Should I Accept the Current Offer?**: Yes, since 487 (value of current offer) is greater than 421 (outside offer value) and the discount factor will only reduce the value in subsequent rounds.\n- **Mistakes to Avoid**:\n  - Mistake 5 would occur if I walked away from a better offer than my outside offer.\n  - Mistake 4 would occur if I accepted an offer worse for me than my outside offer. I am not making any of these mistakes.\n\nGiven the analysis, the optimal action is to accept the current offer as it provides a higher value than my outside option.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

Therefore, reaching a deal earlier could retain more of the offer's value.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n- **Current Offer Analysis:**\n  - Current offer to me: [1, 3, 4, 2, 1]\n  - Value calculation:\n    - Item 1: 1 \u00d7 31 = 31\n    - Item 2: 3 \u00d7 77 = 231\n    - Item 3: 4 \u00d7 33 = 132\n    - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 46 = 92\n    - Item 5: 1 \u00d7 52 = 52\n  - Total value to me = 31 + 231 + 132 + 92 + 52 = 538\n\n- **Comparison to Outside Offer:**\n  - Current offer value (538) is greater than my outside offer value (510).\n  - Therefore, this offer is promising, as it already surpasses my fallback option.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n- **Accept the Current Offer:** Since 538 is already higher than 510, it would be a rational choice to accept as this offer exceeds my outside offer.\n- **Mistakes to Avoid:**\n  - The only mistake relevant here would potentially be mistake 4 (Accepting an offer worse than my outside offer), but since 538 > 510, this isn't the case.\n\nBased on these considerations, the rational decision is:\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 1, 0, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 1, 0, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 259. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1206 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Accepting this offer would align with my objective of maximizing my value as it is better than my guaranteed fallback.\n  \n- **Should I walk away and take my outside offer?** No, as walking away would give me a lower value (183) versus the current offer (311).\n\n- **Should I propose a specific counteroffer?** While proposing a counteroffer might yield a higher value, it also risks Player 1 rejecting it in subsequent rounds and the discount factor reducing the present value of the negotiation outcome.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 296. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 633 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 2, 1, 2, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 2, 1, 2, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To decide the best action, let's walk through the analysis step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **Outside Offer Value**: 296.\n- **Values of the Items**:\n  - Item 1: 65\n  - Item 2: 14\n  - Item 3: 81\n  - Item 4: 23\n  - Item 5: 28\n- **Total Pool of Items**:\n  - 4 units of Item 1\n  - 3 units of Item 2\n  - 3 units of Item 3\n  - 4 units of Item 4\n  - 6 units of Item 5\n- **Discount Factor (gamma)**: 0.98\n\nThe discount factor encourages us to consider the benefit of taking a current offer as opposed to waiting, as future offers are discounted.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\nGiven the current offer on the table [3, 2, 1, 2, 2], calculate the value to me:\n\n- 3 units of Item 1: 3 \u00d7 65 = 195\n- 2 units of Item 2: 2 \u00d7 14 = 28\n- 1 unit of Item 3: 1 \u00d7 81 = 81\n- 2 units of Item 4: 2 \u00d7 23 = 46\n- 2 units of Item 5: 2 \u00d7 28 = 56\n\n**Total Value of Current Offer**: 195 + 28 + 81 + 46 + 56 = 406\n\n**Comparison to Outside Offer**: 406 is greater than 296, so the current offer is preferable to walking away for my outside offer.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nGiven my analysis:\n- **Accepting the Current Offer**: The value of 406 is higher than my outside offer of 296. Accepting the offer yields a better payoff than walking away.\n- **Walking Away**: This would result in a value of 296, which is less advantageous than the current offer.\n- **Counteroffer**: Any counteroffer should aim to maintain or improve my payoff. Since the current offer already provides a higher value than the outside offer and it is round 1, it might provoke future concessions from Player 1 if I propose a reasonable counteroffer.\n\nConsidering the above analysis, it is most beneficial to accept the current offer since it is above my outside offer and satisfies my interest immediately without risking future uncertainties or discounted values.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 2, 2, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 2, 2, 3]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "To make a decision, we'll go through the steps provided:\n\n### 1) Analyze the Current Situation:\n- **My outside offer value:** 335\n- **Values of the items to me:**\n  - Item 1: 24\n  - Item 2: 42\n  - Item 3: 44\n  - Item 4: 60\n  - Item 5: 30\n\n- **Total pool of items:**\n  - 5 units of item 1\n  - 4 units of item 2\n  - 3 units of item 3\n  - 3 units of item 4\n  - 5 units of item 5\n\n- **Discount factor:** Gamma = 0.98. This influences the value where if we don't accept now, future rounds have a slightly decreased present value of the same offer.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n- **Current offer on the table (to you): [1, 0, 2, 2, 3]**\n  - Item 1: 1 unit \u00d7 24 = 24\n  - Item 2: 0 units \u00d7 42 = 0\n  - Item 3: 2 units \u00d7 44 = 88\n  - Item 4: 2 units \u00d7 60 = 120\n  - Item 5: 3 units \u00d7 30 = 90\n  - Total value = 24 + 0 + 88 + 120 + 90 = 322\n\n- If I accept, my value is 322. I compare this to my outside offer value of 335:\n  - Accepting this offer is worse than my outside offer of 335.\n  - Discount factor reduced value for future: Since it's round 1, the discount factor would be applied beginning from round 2 if I await another round. Immediate value needs no adjustment.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision Based on the Analysis:\nGiven this analysis:\n- Accepting the current offer yields a payoff of 322, which is less than my outside offer of 335.\n- Walking away guarantees me a value of 335.\n- To consider a counteroffer:\n  - I could propose a split where my share is worth at least 335.\n\nConsidering these points, the decision will focus on ensuring my offer proposal (a counteroffer) is worth at least 335. However, first, I calculate:\n\nLet's try:\n- Items 1: 2 units, Items 2: 2 units, Items 3: 1 unit, Items 4: 1 unit, Items 5: 2 units offered to Player 1. This leaves for me:\n\nItem 1: 3 units = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72  \nItem 2: 2 units = 2 \u00d7 42 = 84  \nItem 3: 2 units = 2 \u00d7 44 = 88  \nItem 4: 2 units = 2 \u00d7 60 = 120  \nItem 5: 3 units = 3 \u00d7 30 = 90  \n\nTotal value to me: 72 + 84 + 88 + 120 + 90 = 454\n\nThis counteroffer would make sure my value is above my outside offer and well above the current offer. Given this, the best choice is to counteroffer as outlined.\n\nTherefore, my action will be to propose the following counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 1, 1, 2]}\n```",

Given that item 2 has the highest value for me (89), and items 3 and 4 have lower values, I could try to get more of item 2 and give up more of items 3 and 4.\n\nLet me propose a counteroffer where I keep more of the high-value items:\n- I'll offer Player 2: [1, 1, 2, 2, 3]\n- Keeping for myself: 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 2 units of item 5\n\nValue calculation for my counteroffer:\n- 4 units of item 1: 4 \u00d7 62 = 248\n- 3 units of item 2: 3 \u00d7 89 = 267\n- 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 28 = 28\n- 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 14 = 14\n- 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 25 = 50\n\nTotal value: 248 + 267 + 28 + 14 + 50 = 607\nWith discount: 607 \u00d7 0.98 = 594.86\n\nThis counteroffer would be worth 594.86 to me, which is better than both my outside offer (77) and Player 2's current offer (512.54).\n\nTherefore, I'll make this counteroffer, as it's better for me while still giving Player 2 significant value in the items they may value more.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 2, 2, 3]}",

If concluding this round, this factor doesn't apply to this decision now because if I accept, I get the full value calculated right away.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer on the Table**: [1, 1, 2, 2, 3]\n  - Value calculation:\n    - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 24 = 24\n    - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 42 = 42\n    - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 44 = 88\n    - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 60 = 120\n    - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 30 = 90\n  - Total value if I accept = 24 + 42 + 88 + 120 + 90 = 364\n\n- **Comparison to Outside Offer**: The value of 364 from the current offer is greater than my outside offer of 335.\n\n### 3) Decision Making\n\n- **Option to ACCEPT**: The current offer provides a value of 364, which is greater than my outside offer. Accepting this offer would avoid the potential decrease in value with further rounds due to the discount factor.\n\n- **Option to WALK**: Walking away would secure me a value of 335, which is less than the current offer.\n\n- **Option to COUNTEROFFER**: While I could propose a counteroffer to increase my advantage slightly, the current offer is already favorable compared to my outside offer. Pursuing further negotiation might risk player 1 retracting to a worse offer or the discount rate diminishing my overall gain.\n\nGiven these considerations, the best decision is to accept the current offer, as it provides a higher value than my outside option.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "To determine the best course of action, let's walk through the situation step-by-step:\n\n1) **Analyze the Current Situation:**\n\n   - My outside offer value is 330.\n\n   - My values per unit of each item are:\n     - Item 1: 64\n     - Item 2: 94\n     - Item 3: 48\n     - Item 4: 41\n     - Item 5: 31\n\n   - Total units of items available: 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5.\n\n   - Discount factor (\\(\\gamma\\)) is 0.98. This factor decreases the present value of outcomes that conclude in later rounds.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n\n   - **Current Offer** [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]:\n\n     - Value from 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 64 = 64\n     - Value from 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 94 = 0\n     - Value from 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 48 = 48\n     - Value from 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 41 = 0\n     - Value from 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 31 = 0\n\n     - Total value of the current offer to me = 64 + 0 + 48 + 0 + 0 = 112\n\n     - Since 112 is less than my outside offer of 330, and significantly worse, I should not accept the current offer.\n\n3) **Make a Decision:**\n\n   - Accept the current offer? No, because my total value from the current offer (112) is less than my outside offer (330).\n   \n   - Walk away? Not yet, because I should explore if a better counteroffer could be made.\n\n   - Propose a counteroffer? Yes, I should make a counteroffer that ensures my value is greater than 330.\n\n   Let's create a counteroffer that maximizes my value while being reasonable:\n\n   - Consider keeping at least enough units of higher-value items to surpass my outside offer value of 330.\n\n   - For example, if I propose to keep:\n\n     - 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 64 = 128\n     - 3 units of item 2: 3 \u00d7 94 = 282\n     - 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 48 = 96\n     - 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 41 = 41\n     - 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 31 = 31\n\n     - Total value = 128 + 282 + 96 + 41 + 31 = 578\n\n   This allocation is more than viable, so offer Player 1 the following:\n   - Offer: [1, 0, 2, 1, 3] to Player 1, keeping [2, 3, 2, 1, 1] for myself.\n\nMy counteroffer:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 2, 1, 3]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 946. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 855 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 119. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 471 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 1, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 1, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

This does not apply as the current offer (164) is better than my outside offer (119).\n  \n- **Decision**: Since the current offer provides a higher value than my outside offer and considering the discounting factor that reduces future value, it is beneficial to accept this offer.\n\nTherefore, the best action is to accept the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

Looking at my item values:\n\n- Item 1 (66 per unit) and Item 5 (58 per unit) are my most valuable\n- Item 2 (13 per unit) and Item 4 (19 per unit) are my least valuable\n- Item 3 has medium value (32 per unit)\n\nA strategic approach would be to keep most of my high-value items while offering more of my lower-value items to Player 2.\n\nLet me calculate a potential offer where I keep most of items 1, 3, and 5, while offering more of items 2 and 4:\n- Offer to Player 2: [2, 4, 0, 3, 0] \n  (2 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5)\n\nValue I keep:\n- 8 units of item 1 = 8 \u00d7 66 = 528\n- 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39\n- 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 32 = 64\n- 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57\n- 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 58 = 116\n- Total value kept: 804\n\nThis is significantly better than my outside offer of 442.\n\n### Step 3: Making a decision\n\nThis offer gives me a value of 804, which is well above my outside offer of 442. It offers Player 2 some of each item except for the two most valuable to me (items 3 and 5). This allows me to keep all of my high-value items while appearing to make a reasonable offer.\n\nSince this is round 1, I should make a somewhat conservative offer that protects my interests but leaves room for negotiation.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

Also, item 2 is valuable (37), and I should keep most of those units. Let me reconsider my offer:\n\nIf I offer Player 2: [2, 1, 1, 3, 1]\nI would keep: [2, 2, 3, 2, 3]\nValue to me:\n- 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 13 = 26\n- 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 37 = 74\n- 3 units of item 3: 3 \u00d7 79 = 237\n- 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 29 = 58\n- 3 units of item 5: 3 \u00d7 34 = 102\n\nTotal value to me: 26 + 74 + 237 + 58 + 102 = 497\nWith discount: 497 \u00d7 0.98 = 487.06\n\nThis is better than my outside offer (452) and slightly better than my previous offer (474.32).\n\n## Step 3: Make a decision\n\nThe current offer from Player 2 is worth only 196 to me, which is much less than my outside offer of 452. I should not accept.\n\nI could walk away, but I still have a chance to make a deal better than my outside offer.\n\nMy new counteroffer of [2, 1, 1, 3, 1] would be worth 487.06 to me after the discount, which is better than my outside offer of 452.\n\nTherefore, I'll make this counteroffer, which gives me a better potential outcome than both walking away and accepting the current offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 1, 3, 1]}",

This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

                    "response": "To determine the best action, I will go through the step-by-step process outlined in the instructions.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 1047.\n   - My private values per unit of each item are: \n     - Item 1: 2\n     - Item 2: 62\n     - Item 3: 22\n     - Item 4: 94\n     - Item 5: 84\n   - The total pool of items is:\n     - 4 units of item 1\n     - 3 units of item 2\n     - 4 units of item 3\n     - 5 units of item 4\n     - 4 units of item 5\n   - Discount factor (gamma) is 0.98. This reduces the value of future deals by applying a factor of 0.98 for each additional round after the first.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer: [2, 1, 1, 3, 1]\n     - Value to me:\n       - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 2 = 4\n       - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 62 = 62\n       - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 22 = 22\n       - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282\n       - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 84 = 84\n     - Total value before discount = 454\n     - Total value after round 2 discount = 454 \u00d7 (0.98) = 445.92\n\n   - Compare this to my outside offer of 1047. The current offer is considerably lower than my outside offer value, even after discounting.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - Accept the current offer? No, as the current offer's value (445.92) is much lower than my outside offer (1047).\n   - Walk away? This would secure my outside offer value, which is better than the current offer.\n   - Propose a counteroffer?\n\n   To decide on a counteroffer, it should be more valuable than my outside offer. I need to ensure the sum of values for the items I keep is higher than my outside offer.\n\nA feasible counteroffer could be:\n   - Keep more of the high-value items (items 2, 4, and 5) and give Player 1 a fair distribution of the remaining items:\n     - Offer [0, 0, 3, 2, 0]\n     - Keep:\n       - 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 2 = 8\n       - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186\n       - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 22 = 22\n       - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282\n       - 4 units of item 5 = 4 \u00d7 84 = 336\n     - Total value = 834\n\n   However, this value is still lower than my outside offer (1047), which makes it risky if not accepted. Given the high value of my outside offer, walking away could be the best option as it guarantees an optimal outcome.\n\nTherefore, my action is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 0, 0, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 0, 0, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To decide on the appropriate action, let's analyze the current situation step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **My Outside Offer Value**: 693\n- **Values of the items to me**:\n  - Item 1: 96\n  - Item 2: 53\n  - Item 3: 83\n  - Item 4: 8\n  - Item 5: 75\n- **Total Pool of Items**:\n  - Item 1: 8 units\n  - Item 2: 1 unit\n  - Item 3: 1 unit\n  - Item 4: 4 units\n  - Item 5: 4 units\n- **Discount Factor**: Gamma = 0.98. This means if it takes more rounds to come to an agreement, any future offer's value will be slightly less valuable to me in present terms compared to an immediate agreement.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Current Offer\n\n**Current Offer**:\n- Offer to me: [3, 0, 0, 1, 2]\n- My total value if I accept:\n  - 3 units of Item 1 = 3 \u00d7 96 = 288\n  - 0 units of Item 2 = 0 \u00d7 53 = 0\n  - 0 units of Item 3 = 0 \u00d7 83 = 0\n  - 1 unit of Item 4 = 1 \u00d7 8 = 8\n  - 2 units of Item 5 = 2 \u00d7 75 = 150\n  - **Total Value** = 288 + 0 + 0 + 8 + 150 = 446\n\n**Comparison to Outside Offer**:\n- The value of accepting the current offer (446) is less than my outside offer value (693).\n\n### Step 3: Decision Making\n\nGiven this analysis:\n- The current offer is **worse** than my outside offer.\n- Accepting the current offer would be a mistake since it yields less value than my fallback option.\n\n**Decision**: I should propose a counteroffer that maintains or exceeds the value of my outside offer.\n\n### Proposed Counteroffer\n\nTo propose a counteroffer, I need to ensure that my retained items have a total value higher than 693. Here's a potential counteroffer strategy:\n\n- Offer Player 1: [5, 1, 0, 2, 0]\n\n**Value to Me**:\n- Retain 3 units of Item 1 = 3 \u00d7 96 = 288\n- Retain 0 units of Item 2 = 0 \u00d7 53 = 0\n- Retain 1 unit of Item 3 = 1 \u00d7 83 = 83\n- Retain 2 units of Item 4 = 2 \u00d7 8 = 16\n- Retain 4 units of Item 5 = 4 \u00d7 75 = 300\n- **Total Retained Value** = 288 + 0 + 83 + 16 + 300 = 687, which is just under my outside offer value, so I may want to adjust slightly.\n\nOn re-evaluation, I should slightly modify the counter to ensure it exceeds my current outside offer. So let's try:\n\n- Offer Player 1: [4, 1, 0, 2, 0]\n\n**Revised Value to Me**:\n- Retain 4 units of Item 1 = 4 \u00d7 96 = 384\n- Retain 0 units of Item 2 = 0 \u00d7 53 = 0\n- Retain 1 unit of Item 3 = 1 \u00d7 83 = 83\n- Retain 2 units of Item 4 = 2 \u00d7 8 = 16\n- Retain 4 units of Item 5 = 4 \u00d7 75 = 300\n- **Total Retained Value** = 384 + 0 + 83 + 16 + 300 = 783\n\nThis exceeds my outside offer value.\n\nGiven this analysis, my action is:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 1, 0, 2, 0]}\n```",

The current offer valuation (465.5) is less than my outside offer.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision:\n- The current offer is worse than my outside offer. Accepting this offer would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\n- Walking away will give me 693, which is better than accepting the current offer.\n- A better approach is to propose a counteroffer that maximizes my value while considering that Player 1 must also prefer not to walk away.\n\nLet's make a counteroffer while avoiding Mistake 2 (offering worse than my outside offer), Mistake 3 (offering everything/nothing), and ensuring Player 1 receives some items of value.\n\n### Counteroffer strategy:\nMy overall aim is to keep the value to me above my outside offer. Let's consider a balanced counteroffer:\n\n**Counteroffer: [3, 0, 1, 1, 0]**\n- Remaining items for me:\n  - 5 units of item 1 = 5 \u00d7 96 = 480\n  - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 53 = 53\n  - 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 83 = 0\n  - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24\n  - 4 units of item 5 = 4 \u00d7 75 = 300\n- Total value before discount = 480 + 53 + 0 + 24 + 300 = 857\n- After discount (round 2): 857 \u00d7 0.98 = 839.86\n\nSince 839.86 is greater than 693, this counteroffer is superior to my outside offer.\n\n**My action**: I will propose the following counteroffer.\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 0, 1, 1, 0]}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

Important items based on my valuation are item 2 and item 5. Item 2 has a high value per unit, so I should try to retain more of it. \n\nProposed counteroffer: Let's give Player 1 one unit of each item except item 2:\n\n   - Offer: [0, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n   - My value for this offer:\n     - Item 1 (full): 1 \u00d7 51 = 51\n     - Item 2 (keep 2): 2 \u00d7 96 = 192\n     - Item 3 (full): 3 \u00d7 18 = 54\n     - Item 4 (2 units kept): 2 \u00d7 17 = 34\n     - Item 5 (5 units kept): 5 \u00d7 93 = 465\n   - Total value = 51 + 192 + 54 + 34 + 465 = 796\n\nThis offer provides a significantly higher value than my outside offer, so it doesn't contradict Mistake 2.\n\nBased on this analysis, my action is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 1, 1]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 3, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 0, 1, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 3, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 0, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Let me think through this negotiation step by step.\n\n1) Current situation analysis:\n   - My outside offer value: 765\n   - My item values: item 1 = 41, item 2 = 22, item 3 = 15, item 4 = 53, item 5 = 92\n   - Total pool: 1 unit of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5\n   - Discount factor: 0.98, and we're in round 3, so any deal will be worth 0.98\u00b2 = 0.9604 of its face value\n\n2) Assessing the value of offers:\n   - Current offer from Player 2 gives me: [1, 2, 3, 3, 4]\n   - Value calculation for current offer:\n     * 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 41 = 41\n     * 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 22 = 44\n     * 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45\n     * 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159\n     * 4 units of item 5 = 4 \u00d7 92 = 368\n     * Total raw value = 657\n     * Discounted value (round 3) = 657 \u00d7 0.9604 = 631.18\n\n   - My outside offer value = 765 (not discounted)\n\n3) Decision making:\n   - Current offer value (631.18) < Outside offer (765)\n   - This is the final round, so any counteroffer I make will likely result in Player 2 walking away, leading to outside offers\n   - Since my outside offer is better than the current offer, I should WALK\n\nSince this is the final round and the current offer value (631.18) is less than my outside offer value (765), taking my outside offer is the best option.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",
