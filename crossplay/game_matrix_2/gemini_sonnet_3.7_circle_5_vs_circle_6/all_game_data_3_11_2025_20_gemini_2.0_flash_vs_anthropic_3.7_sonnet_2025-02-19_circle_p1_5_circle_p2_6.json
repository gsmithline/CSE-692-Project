Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1337. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 834 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 6, 6, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    7 x 0 + 84 x 3 + 79 x 6 + 70 x 6 + 38 x 5\n    which is 1336 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1337. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

They offered me [0, 1, 1, 2, 0], meaning I would get:\n- 0 units of item 1: 0 \u00d7 52 = 0\n- 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 73 = 73\n- 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 63 = 63\n- 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 37 = 74\n- 0 units of item 5: 0 \u00d7 73 = 0\nTotal value: 210\n\nThis is significantly below my outside offer of 1257, so accepting would be a mistake.\n\nLet me determine what a reasonable counteroffer would be. If I look at what Player 1 offered, they seem to be keeping most items for themselves, especially items 1 and 5 (which they're keeping completely). \n\nI need to make an offer that gives me value above my outside offer, while being reasonable to Player 1. Looking at my values, items 2 and 5 are most valuable to me (73 each), followed by item 3 (63), then item 1 (52), and finally item 4 (37).\n\nLet me try keeping most of the high-value items for myself:\n- I keep 3 units of item 1, offer 0 to Player 1\n- I keep 4 units of item 2, offer 1 to Player 1\n- I keep 6 units of item 3, offer 1 to Player 1\n- I keep 5 units of item 4, offer 3 to Player 1\n- I keep 5 units of item 5, offer 0 to Player 1\n\nValue for me:\n- 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (item 1)\n- 4 \u00d7 73 = 292 (item 2)\n- 6 \u00d7 63 = 378 (item 3)\n- 5 \u00d7 37 = 185 (item 4)\n- 5 \u00d7 73 = 365 (item 5)\nTotal: 1376\n\nThis gives me 1376, which is greater than my outside offer of 1257, so this is a good starting point.\n\n3) Decision:\nSince the current offer (210) is much lower than my outside offer (1257), accepting would be a mistake.\nMy counteroffer of [0, 1, 1, 3, 0] would give me a value of 1376, which is better than my outside offer.\n\nTherefore, I will make this counteroffer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 1, 3, 0]}",

This means that an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 0.98 times the value of the same offer accepted in round 2. Since it is now round 2, accepting now gets a discount factor of 0.98^(2-1) = 0.98 compared to 0.98^(3-1) = 0.9604 in round 3, so the difference is 0.0196.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer (to me):** [0, 1, 1, 3, 0]\n    *   This means I receive 0 of Item 1, 1 of Item 2, 1 of Item 3, 3 of Item 4, and 0 of Item 5.\n    *   My value for this offer: (0 * 7) + (1 * 84) + (1 * 79) + (3 * 70) + (0 * 38) = 0 + 84 + 79 + 210 + 0 = 373\n*   **Items I would keep if I accept:**\n    *   Item 1: 3 - 0 = 3\n    *   Item 2: 5 - 1 = 4\n    *   Item 3: 7 - 1 = 6\n    *   Item 4: 8 - 3 = 5\n    *   Item 5: 5 - 0 = 5\n    *   My value for what I keep: (3 * 7) + (4 * 84) + (6 * 79) + (5 * 70) + (5 * 38) = 21 + 336 + 474 + 350 + 190 = 1371\n*   **Value of accepting the current offer adjusted for the discount factor:**\n    * 1371 * 0.98 = 1343.58\n\nSince 1371 > 1337, it's better to accept the current offer than to WALK.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer, keeping [3, 4, 6, 5, 5] and giving [0, 1, 1, 3, 0] is worth 1371 to me.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 628. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 798 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 6, 1, 4, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    65 x 0 + 71 x 6 + 37 x 1 + 41 x 4 + 52 x 0\n    which is 627 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 628. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 746. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 675 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 3, 1, 4, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    35 x 3 + 93 x 3 + 9 x 1 + 46 x 4 + 42 x 4\n    which is 745 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 746. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

This means that an offer accepted in a later round is worth slightly less than the same offer accepted now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - There is currently no offer on the table.\n   - I need to determine a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Develop a strategy to generate a counteroffer:**\n\nI need to come up with an offer (items given to Player 2) such that the remaining items I keep are worth more than 746. I will aim to give Player 2 a fair share of the items while ensuring my own value exceeds my outside offer. I'll start by offering a relatively even split where possible, and adjusting based on my high-value items (item 2 especially) and low-value items (item 3).\nI will start by offering Player 2 half the items. However, since items cannot be split, I will aim to give half or slightly less, while ensuring I maximize my value.\nLet's try offering the following to Player 2:\nItem 1: 2\nItem 2: 1\nItem 3: 3\nItem 4: 2\nItem 5: 2\n\nThis leaves me with:\nItem 1: 3\nItem 2: 2\nItem 3: 3\nItem 4: 3\nItem 5: 3\n\nMy value would be:\n3 * 35 + 2 * 93 + 3 * 9 + 3 * 46 + 3 * 42 = 105 + 186 + 27 + 138 + 126 = 582.\n\nThis is not better than my outside offer.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 3, 1, 4, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    35 x 3 + 93 x 3 + 9 x 1 + 46 x 4 + 42 x 4\n    which is 745 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 746. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 2, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 5, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 5, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and decide on the best action.\n\n1. **Analyze the current situation:**\n    - My outside offer value: 746\n    - My item values: item 1 = 35, item 2 = 93, item 3 = 9, item 4 = 46, item 5 = 42\n    - Total items: 5 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5\n    - Discount factor: 0.98. This means accepting an offer now is slightly better than waiting until the next round, but the difference is small.\n\n2. **Assess the value of offers:**\n    - Current offer: [0, 0, 0, 5, 0] means I get 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 5 of item 4, and 0 of item 5.\n    - My value of the current offer: (0 * 35) + (0 * 93) + (0 * 9) + (5 * 46) + (0 * 42) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 230 + 0 = 230.\n    - Since 230 is much less than my outside offer of 746, accepting this offer would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\n\n3. **Consider a counteroffer:**\n    - I want to find an offer that is better than 746 for me, and also potentially attractive to Player 2.\n    - Let's calculate my total possible value: (5 * 35) + (3 * 93) + (6 * 9) + (5 * 46) + (5 * 42) = 175 + 279 + 54 + 230 + 210 = 948.\n    - I will propose an offer where I give away some of the less valuable items to Player 2, while keeping the valuable item 2.\n\nLet's try an offer: I keep all of item 2 and the remaining items are distributed such that I retain most of item 1, while offering the rest of the other items.\n\nMy counteroffer (what I give to Player 2) = [1, 0, 4, 2, 2]\nThis means I keep:\nItem 1: 5 - 1 = 4 units, value 4 * 35 = 140\nItem 2: 3 - 0 = 3 units, value 3 * 93 = 279\nItem 3: 6 - 4 = 2 units, value 2 * 9 = 18\nItem 4: 5 - 2 = 3 units, value 3 * 46 = 138\nItem 5: 5 - 2 = 3 units, value 3 * 42 = 126\nTotal value for me: 140 + 279 + 18 + 138 + 126 = 701\n\nSince 701 is still less than my outside option of 746, I need to re-evaluate.\nLet's consider the opposite strategy: giving away the less valuable items but keeping the valuable ones.\nCounteroffer = [0, 0, 6, 5, 5]\n\nThis means I keep:\nItem 1: 5 - 0 = 5 units, value 5 * 35 = 175\nItem 2: 3 - 0 = 3 units, value 3 * 93 = 279\nItem 3: 6 - 6 = 0 units, value 0 * 9 = 0\nItem 4: 5 - 5 = 0 units, value 0 * 46 = 0\nItem 5: 5 - 5 = 0 units, value 0 * 42 = 0\nTotal value for me: 175 + 279 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 454\nStill less than 746.\n\nNow, I'll try to retain as much as possible from items 1 and 2.\nCounteroffer = [2, 0, 6, 5, 5]\nItem 1: 5 - 2 = 3 units, value 3 * 35 = 105\nItem 2: 3 - 0 = 3 units, value 3 * 93 = 279\nItem 3: 6 - 6 = 0 units, value 0 * 9 = 0\nItem 4: 5 - 5 = 0 units, value 0 * 46 = 0\nItem 5: 5 - 5 = 0 units, value 0 * 42 = 0\nTotal value: 105 + 279 = 384\n\nCounteroffer = [0, 0, 3, 0, 0]\nItem 1: 5 - 0 = 5 units, value 5 * 35 = 175\nItem 2: 3 - 0 = 3 units, value 3 * 93 = 279\nItem 3: 6 - 3 = 3 units, value 3 * 9 = 27\nItem 4: 5 - 0 = 5 units, value 5 * 46 = 230\nItem 5: 5 - 0 = 5 units, value 5 * 42 = 210\nTotal Value: 175+279+27+230+210 = 921\n\nSince the game is in round 2, I will propose a counteroffer that benefits me better than walking away.

Item 2 hasn't appeared in their offers, suggesting they might not value it highly.\n\nMy most valuable items are:\n1. Item 1 (70 per unit)\n2. Item 2 (56 per unit)\n3. Item 5 (36 per unit)\n4. Item 3 (27 per unit)\n5. Item 4 (7 per unit)\n\nI should keep most of my high-value items (1, 2, 5) and offer more of my low-value items (3, 4).\n\nLet's try a counteroffer where I offer:\n- 0 units of item 1 (keeping all 5)\n- 0 units of item 2 (keeping all 3)\n- 4 units of item 3 (keeping 2)\n- 5 units of item 4 (keeping 0)\n- 1 unit of item 5 (keeping 4)\n\nWhat I would keep:\n- 5 units of item 1 = 5 \u00d7 70 = 350\n- 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168\n- 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 27 = 54\n- 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 7 = 0\n- 4 units of item 5 = 4 \u00d7 36 = 144\n- Total value: 716\n\nThis is lower than my outside offer. Let me adjust.\n\nLet's try again with:\n- 0 units of item 1 (keeping all 5)\n- 0 units of item 2 (keeping all 3) \n- 3 units of item 3 (keeping 3)\n- 5 units of item 4 (keeping 0)\n- 0 units of item 5 (keeping all 5)\n\nWhat I would keep:\n- 5 units of item 1 = 5 \u00d7 70 = 350\n- 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168\n- 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 27 = 81\n- 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 7 = 0\n- 5 units of item 5 = 5 \u00d7 36 = 180\n- Total value: 779\n\nStill below my outside offer. I need to keep more of something.\n\nFinal attempt with a minimal offer:\n- 0 units of item 1 (keeping all 5)\n- 0 units of item 2 (keeping all 3)\n- 1 unit of item 3 (keeping 5)\n- 5 units of item 4 (keeping 0)\n- 0 units of item 5 (keeping all 5)\n\nWhat I would keep:\n- 5 units of item 1 = 5 \u00d7 70 = 350\n- 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168\n- 5 units of item 3 = 5 \u00d7 27 = 135\n- 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 7 = 0\n- 5 units of item 5 = 5 \u00d7 36 = 180\n- Total value: 833\n\nThis is still below my outside offer of 891. It seems that the most value I can get from any division is less than my outside offer.\n\n## 4) Decision\n\nSince both accepting the current offer and any reasonable counteroffer would result in a value less than my outside offer, the rational choice is to walk away and take my outside offer of 891.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best course of action for round 1.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** 813\n*   **Item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 87\n    *   Item 2: 83\n    *   Item 3: 87\n    *   Item 4: 66\n    *   Item 5: 83\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 4\n    *   Item 2: 4\n    *   Item 3: 3\n    *   Item 4: 1\n    *   Item 5: 2\n*   **Discount factor:** 0.98. This means that an offer accepted in a later round is worth slightly less. Since it's round 1, the discount factor isn't a huge concern yet, but it's good to keep in mind.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Since I'm going first, I need to make an initial offer. I want to find an offer that is both appealing to Player 2 and gives me a value greater than my outside offer. I need to offer enough to entice the other player, but not so much that I get less than my outside offer.\n\n    Let's start by considering an even split, and adjust from there:\n    Offer Player 2 half of each item (rounding down):\n    *   Item 1: 2\n    *   Item 2: 2\n    *   Item 3: 1\n    *   Item 4: 0\n    *   Item 5: 1\n\n    This leaves me with:\n    *   Item 1: 2\n    *   Item 2: 2\n    *   Item 3: 2\n    *   Item 4: 1\n    *   Item 5: 1\n\n    My value would be:\n    2 * 87 + 2 * 83 + 2 * 87 + 1 * 66 + 1 * 83 = 174 + 166 + 174 + 66 + 83 = 663\n\n    This is less than my outside offer of 813. I need to offer less to Player 2.\n\n    Let's try offering Player 2:\n    * Item 1: 1\n    * Item 2: 1\n    * Item 3: 1\n    * Item 4: 0\n    * Item 5: 1\n    \n    This leaves me with:\n    * Item 1: 3\n    * Item 2: 3\n    * Item 3: 2\n    * Item 4: 1\n    * Item 5: 1\n    \n    My value would be:\n    3 * 87 + 3 * 83 + 2 * 87 + 1 * 66 + 1 * 83 = 261 + 249 + 174 + 66 + 83 = 833\n\n    This is greater than my outside offer of 813.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nI should propose the counteroffer: offer Player 2 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5. This gives me a value of 833, which is greater than my outside offer of 813.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 0, 1]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 813.\n   - My values for the items are: item 1 = 87, item 2 = 83, item 3 = 87, item 4 = 66, item 5 = 83.\n   - The total pool of items is: 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 2 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor is 0.98. This means that accepting an offer in round 2 gives me 0.98 times the value of the offer, and accepting in round 3 gives me 0.98^2 times the value of the offer.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current Offer:** The current offer is [3, 3, 1, 0, 0] (items offered to me). This means I would receive 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5. This implies that I keep 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 2 unit of item 5.\n      - Value of current offer to me: (1 * 87) + (1 * 83) + (2 * 87) + (1 * 66) + (2 * 83) = 87 + 83 + 174 + 66 + 166 = 576\n      - Discounted value in round 2: 576 * 0.98 = 564.48\n\n   - **Outside Offer:** My outside offer is worth 813.\n\n   - **Previous Offer:** The previous offer by Player 1 was [1, 1, 1, 0, 1]. If I accept that, I get: 1*87 + 1*83 + 1*87 + 0*66 + 1*83 = 87 + 83 + 87 + 0 + 83 = 340. Discounted by 0.98, it's 340 * 0.98 = 333.2.\n\n   - **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to explore counteroffers that give me a value greater than 813.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\nThe current offer gives me a value of 564.48 (discounted), which is much less than my outside offer of 813. Therefore, accepting is not a good idea. Walking away guarantees me 813. I need to explore counteroffers to see if I can improve my situation. Let's try a few:\n\n*   **Counteroffer 1: Give away most items.**\n    I give away 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 1 units of item 5. That is offer of [3, 3, 2, 0, 1].\n    This means I keep 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 units of item 5.\n    The value to me is (1 * 87) + (1 * 83) + (1 * 87) + (1 * 66) + (1 * 83) = 87 + 83 + 87 + 66 + 83 = 406. Discounted in this round, this becomes 406 * 0.98 = 397.88. Since 397.88 < 813, this offer is not good enough.\n\n*   **Counteroffer 2: Give away few items.**\n    I give away 1 unit of item 1, 1 units of item 2, 0 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5 to opponent. This means that I would offer [1, 1, 0, 0, 0] and I would keep the rest.\n     The value to me is (3 * 87) + (3 * 83) + (3 * 87) + (1 * 66) + (2 * 83) = 261 + 249 + 261 + 66 + 166 = 1003. Discounted in this round, this becomes 1003 * 0.98 = 982.94. Since 982.94 > 813, this is better than my outside offer.\n\nGiven the current state of the negotiation, the best course of action is to make a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 24. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 414 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 4, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    4 x 4 + 1 x 4 + 49 x 0 + 55 x 0 + 29 x 0\n    which is 20 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 24. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 409. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 579 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 4, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    9 x 0 + 83 x 2 + 47 x 4 + 16 x 1 + 38 x 1\n    which is 408 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 409. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 0, 3, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 0, 3, 1, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [3, 0, 4, 1, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [2, 0, 3, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 0, 3, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and decide on the best action for Player 1 in Round 3.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 409\n*   **Item values:** Item 1: 9, Item 2: 83, Item 3: 47, Item 4: 16, Item 5: 38\n*   **Total items:** Item 1: 7, Item 2: 2, Item 3: 7, Item 4: 2, Item 5: 2\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.98.  Since this is round 3, if we accept, the value is multiplied by 0.98^(3-1) = 0.98^2 = 0.9604\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer (to me):** [2, 0, 3, 1, 0]\n    This means I receive 2 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 0 units of item 5. My value for this offer is:\n    (2 * 9) + (0 * 83) + (3 * 47) + (1 * 16) + (0 * 38) = 18 + 0 + 141 + 16 + 0 = 175\n    Adjusted for the discount factor: 175 * 0.9604 = 168.07\n\n*   **Evaluate WALK option:** If I WALK, I get my outside offer of 409.\n\n*   **Consider Counteroffer options:** I need to figure out what I could get if I make a counteroffer, considering Player 2's likely response and the discount factor.  Since this is the last round, a counteroffer is essentially a walk because if they offer back it's treated as a walk. So I just need to see if I can get something better than my outside offer *without* another turn. I will receive the items which I dont give to them.\n\nLet's consider offering Player 2 only the items they seem to value least, based on the negotiation history. They seem unconcerned with items 2 and 5, so let's try an offer where I keep most of the items I value, focusing on getting above my outside offer.\n\nConsider the allocation to Player 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nI keep: [7, 2, 7, 2, 2]\nMy value = (7*9) + (2*83) + (7*47) + (2*16) + (2*38) = 63 + 166 + 329 + 32 + 76 = 666\nSince the discount factor is applied to any agreement, the discounted value would be 666 * 0.9604 = 639.5.  This is still much better than the outside offer of 409.\n\nHowever, it seems unlikely that they would agree to give me all the items. So, I must choose between accepting the current offer, which is not great, or walking away and getting 409.\n\nSince 409 > 168.07, I should WALK.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

This suggests they might be testing how much I'll accept or they highly value most items.\n\nSince their offer (value 63) is far below my outside offer (230), I should definitely not accept it.\n\nMy counteroffer of [3, 2, 0, 3, 2] keeps all of item 3 (my highest value item) for myself while offering Player 1 all of item 1 (my lowest value item) and balanced amounts of the other items.\n\nThis counteroffer gives me a value of 462, which is significantly better than my outside offer of 230, so it's a good strategic move.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 2, 0, 3, 2]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 815. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 657 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 5, 2, 1, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    30 x 3 + 94 x 5 + 14 x 2 + 33 x 1 + 48 x 4\n    which is 813 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 815. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 5, 2, 1, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    30 x 3 + 94 x 5 + 14 x 2 + 33 x 1 + 48 x 4\n    which is 813 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 815. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Based on Player 1's offer, they're splitting most items evenly, which means they might value all items somewhat similarly. However, I particularly value item 5 (86 per unit) and item 3 (56 per unit), followed by item 2 (54 per unit).\n\nI should try to keep more of items 5, 3, and 2 while offering more of items 1 and 4 which I value less.\n\nA potential counteroffer could be [3, 1, 2, 3, 1], giving Player 1:\n- 3 units of item 1 (keeping 1 for myself)\n- 1 unit of item 2 (keeping 2 for myself)\n- 2 units of item 3 (keeping 3 for myself)\n- 3 units of item 4 (keeping 1 for myself)\n- 1 unit of item 5 (keeping 3 for myself)\n\nLet me calculate my value if this counteroffer is accepted:\n- 1 \u00d7 17 = 17 (item 1)\n- 2 \u00d7 54 = 108 (item 2)\n- 3 \u00d7 56 = 168 (item 3)\n- 1 \u00d7 21 = 21 (item 4)\n- 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (item 5)\n\nTotal value: 17 + 108 + 168 + 21 + 258 = 572\n\nThis counteroffer would give me 572, which is significantly better than both my outside offer (367) and the current offer (414).\n\nGiven this analysis, I'll make this counteroffer to try to improve my position.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 1, 2, 3, 1]}",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    38 x 0 + 31 x 0 + 97 x 0 + 88 x 0 + 10 x 2\n    which is 20 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 22. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 2, 2, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 1, 2, 3, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 1, 2, 3, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

This means waiting for a future round reduces the value by a factor of 0.98.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [3, 1, 2, 3, 1].

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 3, 5, 5, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    25 x 1 + 37 x 3 + 32 x 5 + 82 x 5 + 8 x 0\n    which is 706 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 707. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n   - My outside offer value: 403\n   - Item values: item 1 = 71, item 2 = 99, item 3 = 15, item 4 = 79, item 5 = 15\n   - Total items: 5 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 7 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5.\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.98.  The discount factor affects whether I should accept an offer now or make a counteroffer and risk a lower value in the next round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer:** I am being offered [4, 0, 3, 0, 2].  This means I would receive:\n      - 4 units of item 1: 4 * 71 = 284\n      - 0 units of item 2: 0 * 99 = 0\n      - 3 units of item 3: 3 * 15 = 45\n      - 0 units of item 4: 0 * 79 = 0\n      - 2 units of item 5: 2 * 15 = 30\n      - Total value of current offer: 284 + 0 + 45 + 0 + 30 = 359\n\n   - **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (359) is less than my outside offer (403). Therefore, accepting this offer would be Mistake 4.\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider counteroffers that are better than my outside offer. Let's consider keeping all of item 2 and item 4, some of item 1, and nothing of items 3 and 5.\n      - If I keep all of item 2 and item 4: 3 * 99 + 7 * 79 = 297 + 553 = 850.  I need to get rid of items 3 and 5 so that these items go to Player 2 in my counteroffer. I would also like to keep 1 unit of Item 1, and give the rest away to player 2. Then I would have:\n      - 1 * 71 + 3 * 99 + 7 * 79 + 0 * 15 + 0 * 15 = 71 + 297 + 553 = 921\n\n      - The current offer on the table is that I receive [4, 0, 3, 0, 2], or that Player 2 receives [1, 3, 3, 7, 0]. Player 1's previous offer was [2, 1, 3, 3, 1]. Since the outside offer is more than the current offer, it makes sense to counteroffer rather than walking away. The goal is to develop an offer which is greater than 403 to me and greater than whatever player 2 would receive from their outside offer.\n\n     So now, let's create a counteroffer. Let's give Player 2 a higher amount of Item 3. To start, let's see if I offer player 2 the following: [0, 3, 6, 0, 2]. I would then receive items [5, 0, 0, 7, 0]. The value for me is: 5*71 + 7*79 = 355 + 553 = 908. This is good. Now what about player 2. They get [0, 3, 6, 0, 2] Their value is 0+ 3*value2 + 6*value3 + 0 + 2*value5.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   Since the current offer (359) is worse than my outside offer (403), I should not accept. I will make a counteroffer that secures me a value greater than 403.\n\nLet's try offering [1, 3, 6, 0, 2]. This means I keep: [4, 0, 0, 7, 0].\nMy value is 4*71 + 7*79 = 284 + 553 = 837.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 5, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    71 x 0 + 99 x 3 + 15 x 5 + 79 x 0 + 15 x 2\n    which is 402 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 403. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 1, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    44 x 0 + 48 x 0 + 7 x 0 + 65 x 1 + 74 x 4\n    which is 361 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 362. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 0, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 0, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

This might indicate they value these items highly. Let me construct a counteroffer that:\n1. Gives me a value significantly above my outside offer\n2. Leaves some high-value items (to me) for Player 1 as a concession\n\n## 3) Counteroffer Construction\n\nI'll start by claiming more of the items I value most (items 4 and 5), while giving away most of item 3 which has low value to me:\n\nIf I keep:\n- Item 1: 4 units = 4 \u00d7 44 = 176\n- Item 2: 4 units = 4 \u00d7 48 = 192\n- Item 3: 0 units = 0 \u00d7 7 = 0\n- Item 4: 4 units = 4 \u00d7 65 = 260\n- Item 5: 4 units = 4 \u00d7 74 = 296\n\nThis would give me a total value of 924, well above my outside offer.\n\nMy counteroffer to Player 1 would be:\n[1, 2, 2, 2, 1]\n\nLet me double-check what this leaves for me:\n- Item 1: 5-1 = 4 (worth 176 to me)\n- Item 2: 6-2 = 4 (worth 192 to me)\n- Item 3: 2-2 = 0 (worth 0 to me)\n- Item 4: 6-2 = 4 (worth 260 to me)\n- Item 5: 5-1 = 4 (worth 296 to me)\n\nTotal value to me: 924\n\nThis is well above my outside offer (362), making it a good counteroffer.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** 480\n*   **Item values:** Item 1: 28, Item 2: 76, Item 3: 74, Item 4: 71, Item 5: 52\n*   **Total items:** Item 1: 5, Item 2: 6, Item 3: 2, Item 4: 6, Item 5: 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.98. This means that accepting an offer in a later round is slightly less valuable than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [1, 2, 2, 2, 1]. This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 5 - 1 = 4\n    *   Item 2: 6 - 2 = 4\n    *   Item 3: 2 - 2 = 0\n    *   Item 4: 6 - 2 = 4\n    *   Item 5: 5 - 1 = 4\n    My value from accepting this offer is: (4 * 28) + (4 * 76) + (0 * 74) + (4 * 71) + (4 * 52) = 112 + 304 + 0 + 284 + 208 = 908\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** 908 > 480.  Accepting the current offer is better than walking away right now.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Let's consider a counteroffer to see if we can improve our position, keeping in mind the discount factor. The current round is Round 2, so we discount by 0.98^(2-1) = 0.98. Thus, the adjusted outside offer would be 480 / 0.98, approx 489.8. To be worth making a counteroffer instead of walking, our offer needs to be better than 489.8.\n\n    First, let's consider the previous offer. The other player offered me [1, 2, 2, 2, 1].\n    In this round, Player 2 is getting 5-1 = 4 items of item 1, 6-2 = 4 items of item 2, 2-2 = 0 items of item 3, 6-2 = 4 items of item 4 and 5-1 = 4 items of item 5.\n    This counteroffer gives Player 2 a value of 4*28 + 4*76 + 0*74 + 4*71 + 4*52 = 112 + 304 + 0 + 284 + 208 = 908.\n\n    I can offer them what they offered me in round 1, which is [1, 2, 0, 2, 1].\n    This gives me a value of (5-1) * 28 + (6-2) * 76 + (2-0) * 74 + (6-2) * 71 + (5-1) * 52 = 4 * 28 + 4 * 76 + 2 * 74 + 4 * 71 + 4 * 52 = 112 + 304 + 148 + 284 + 208 = 1056\n    With the discount factor it has value of 1056 * 0.98 = 1034.88. The counteroffer is valid since 1034.88 is larger than my outside offer 480.\n    Is making this counteroffer beneficial, considering that I can get 908 if I accept the current offer? Let's discount it too.\n    908 * 0.98 = 889.84. So 889.84 < 1034.88 so it's beneficial.\n\n    I can also consider offering [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], but I want to avoid Mistake 3.\n    If I offer nothing, then my value is 5 * 28 + 6 * 76 + 2 * 74 + 6 * 71 + 5 * 52 = 140 + 456 + 148 + 426 + 260 = 1430 * 0.98 = 1401.4\n    This is a very risky move, since it's unlikely the other agent will accept.\n\n    I will propose [1, 2, 0, 2, 1] to improve my negotiation position.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is better than my outside offer.\n*   A counteroffer of [1, 2, 0, 2, 1] would improve my value even more, even after taking the discount factor into account.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 0, 2, 1]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 2, 2, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    53 x 0 + 11 x 0 + 58 x 2 + 78 x 2 + 20 x 0\n    which is 272 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 273. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Let's start by figuring out the total value of all items.\n    *   Item 1: 1 * 53 = 53\n    *   Item 2: 3 * 11 = 33\n    *   Item 3: 11 * 58 = 638\n    *   Item 4: 4 * 78 = 312\n    *   Item 5: 10 * 20 = 200\n    *   Total Value = 53 + 33 + 638 + 312 + 200 = 1236\n\nLet's try an initial offer that gives the other player a relatively large portion of the less valuable items and a smaller portion of the more valuable items. Let's try offering Player 2:\nItem 1: 0\nItem 2: 2\nItem 3: 6\nItem 4: 2\nItem 5: 5\n\nThis would leave me with:\nItem 1: 1\nItem 2: 1\nItem 3: 5\nItem 4: 2\nItem 5: 5\n\nMy value would then be:\n1 * 53 + 1 * 11 + 5 * 58 + 2 * 78 + 5 * 20 = 53 + 11 + 290 + 156 + 100 = 610\n\nThis is greater than my outside offer of 273.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 2, 2, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    53 x 0 + 11 x 0 + 58 x 2 + 78 x 2 + 20 x 0\n    which is 272 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 273. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 6, 2, 5]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 5, 2, 5]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 5, 2, 5]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 273\n*   My item values: item 1 = 53, item 2 = 11, item 3 = 58, item 4 = 78, item 5 = 20\n*   Total items: item 1 = 1, item 2 = 3, item 3 = 11, item 4 = 4, item 5 = 10\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.98. This means waiting another round reduces the value by 2%.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [0, 1, 5, 2, 5]. This means I keep:\n    *   item 1: 1 - 0 = 1\n    *   item 2: 3 - 1 = 2\n    *   item 3: 11 - 5 = 6\n    *   item 4: 4 - 2 = 2\n    *   item 5: 10 - 5 = 5\n    *   Value of current offer to me: (1 * 53) + (2 * 11) + (6 * 58) + (2 * 78) + (5 * 20) = 53 + 22 + 348 + 156 + 100 = 679.\n    *   Since this is round 2, the discounted value is 679 * 0.98^(2-1) = 679 * 0.98 = 665.42\n\n*   **Compare to outside offer:** 665.42 > 273.  So, accepting the current offer is better than walking away right now.\n\n*   **Consider a counteroffer:**  The other player offered me [0, 1, 5, 2, 5] in round 2, and offered [0, 1, 5, 2, 5] in round 1. They are not budging from this.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is much better than my outside offer.\n*   Since the current offer is much better than my outside offer, it would be optimal to accept.\n*   Waiting could be riskier since the maximum number of rounds remaining is 1, and the discount factor could make a future offer less desirable.\n\nTherefore, I will accept the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

I get to keep 2 units of the items I value most, and the only downside is getting 0 units of item 4, which has my lowest value (13).\n\nSince this is only round 1, if I accept now, I get the full value of 514. If I make a counteroffer, we move to round 2 and values get discounted by 2%. Also, making a counteroffer that's worse for me than the current offer doesn't make strategic sense.\n\nTherefore, I'll accept the current offer since:\n1. It gives me a value of 514, which is better than my outside offer of 459\n2. Accepting now avoids any discount\n3. The offer aligns well with my item preferences\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 1, 7, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    93 x 0 + 100 x 1 + 12 x 1 + 16 x 7 + 48 x 5\n    which is 464 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 465. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

I must ensure that my retained items are worth at least 465 to me.\n\n3) **Making a decision:**\n\nSince there is no current offer, I need to make an initial offer.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 1, 7, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    93 x 0 + 100 x 1 + 12 x 1 + 16 x 7 + 48 x 5\n    which is 464 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 465. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 2, 3, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 2, 3, 3, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 3, 3, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 465\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 93, Item 2: 100, Item 3: 12, Item 4: 16, Item 5: 48\n*   **Total items:** Item 1: 3, Item 2: 5, Item 3: 4, Item 4: 7, Item 5: 5\n*   **Discount factor:** 0.98. This means accepting an offer in round 2 is slightly less valuable than in round 1.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [1, 2, 3, 3, 1]. This means Player 2 is offering me:\n    *   1 unit of item 1\n    *   2 units of item 2\n    *   3 units of item 3\n    *   3 units of item 4\n    *   1 unit of item 5\n\n    My value for this offer is:\n    (1 * 93) + (2 * 100) + (3 * 12) + (3 * 16) + (1 * 48) = 93 + 200 + 36 + 48 + 48 = 425\n\n    Discounted value: 425 * 0.98 = 416.5\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The discounted value of the current offer (416.5) is less than my outside offer (465). So, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that, after keeping the remaining items, gives me a value greater than 465.\n\n    Let's start by aiming to secure a value higher than the outside offer but also reasonable to propose as a counteroffer. If I keep all the item 2, I get 500, which is already higher than 465. Let's see if I could have Player 2 take only 1 unit, keeping 4 for myself. So let's try giving:\n    * Item 1: 3\n    * Item 2: 1\n    * Item 3: 4\n    * Item 4: 7\n    * Item 5: 5\n    This will mean I keep 0, 4, 0, 0, 0 for items 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The total value is 4 * 100 = 400.\n    This is less than 465, so this proposal is not helpful.\n\n    Let's try another counteroffer, giving:\n    * Item 1: 2\n    * Item 2: 0\n    * Item 3: 2\n    * Item 4: 4\n    * Item 5: 3\n\n    This means I keep:\n    * Item 1: 1\n    * Item 2: 5\n    * Item 3: 2\n    * Item 4: 3\n    * Item 5: 2\n    My value for this is: (1 * 93) + (5 * 100) + (2 * 12) + (3 * 16) + (2 * 48) = 93 + 500 + 24 + 48 + 96 = 761\n\n    This is a better value.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is worse than my outside offer.\n*   I've found a counteroffer that provides a significantly higher value than my outside offer.\n\nTherefore, I should make the counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 2, 4, 3]}\n```",

Since this is round 3, the discount factor will be 0.98^(3-1) = 0.98^2 = 0.9604\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - Current offer: Player 2 is offering me [1, 4, 2, 3, 1].  This means I receive:\n      - 1 unit of item 1\n      - 4 units of item 2\n      - 2 units of item 3\n      - 3 units of item 4\n      - 1 unit of item 5\n   - Value of current offer: (1 * 93) + (4 * 100) + (2 * 12) + (3 * 16) + (1 * 48) = 93 + 400 + 24 + 48 + 48 = 613\n   - Discounted value of current offer: 613 * 0.9604 = 588.7252\n\n   - Comparison to outside offer: 588.7252 > 465.  So, accepting is better than walking away *if* the current offer is the best I can get.\n\n   - Let's consider making a counteroffer. I need to figure out if I can make an offer that Player 2 will accept, and which will give me a *better* value than 588.7252. Since this is round 3, a counteroffer from me will be treated as a WALK for Player 2. Therefore, making a counteroffer now is equivalent to walking away, which is worse than accepting the current offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   - Accepting the current offer yields a discounted value of 588.7252.\n   - Walking away yields a value of 465.\n   - Any counteroffer is equivalent to walking away.\n\nTherefore, my best course of action is to ACCEPT the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 2, 0, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    62 x 1 + 23 x 1 + 69 x 2 + 47 x 0 + 35 x 4\n    which is 363 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 364.

This means that accepting an offer later is slightly less valuable than accepting it now.\n\n2)  **Initial Offer Strategy:**\n\n    As the first player, I want to make an offer that is likely to be accepted but also maximizes my value. I need to offer Player 2 enough to make them prefer my offer over their outside offer, but not so much that I'm worse off than taking my own outside offer.\n\n    Let's start by considering a relatively even split and then adjusting based on my valuations. I'll aim to keep a little more of the items I value highly (item 3, then item 1) and give away more of the items I value less (items 2 and 5). Item 4 is unique with only 1 unit available.\n\n    Let's propose giving Player 2 the following:\n\n    *   Item 1: 2 units\n    *   Item 2: 3 units\n    *   Item 3: 3 units\n    *   Item 4: 0 units\n    *   Item 5: 2 units\n\n    This means I keep:\n\n    *   Item 1: 2 units\n    *   Item 2: 3 units\n    *   Item 3: 3 units\n    *   Item 4: 1 unit\n    *   Item 5: 2 units\n\n    My value for this division is:\n\n    *   2 \\* 62 + 3 \\* 23 + 3 \\* 69 + 1 \\* 47 + 2 \\* 35 = 124 + 69 + 207 + 47 + 70 = 517\n\n    Since 517 > 364, this offer is better than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Action:**\n\n    I'll make the counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 3, 3, 0, 2]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 2, 0, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    62 x 1 + 23 x 1 + 69 x 2 + 47 x 0 + 35 x 4\n    which is 363 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 364. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 3, 3, 0, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 2, 1, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 1, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 364.\n   - My values for items 1-5 are 62, 23, 69, 47, 35 respectively.\n   - The total pool of items is 4, 6, 6, 1, 4.\n   - The discount factor is 0.98. This means that accepting an offer next round is worth 98% of what it's worth this round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer:** I am being offered [1, 2, 1, 0, 1] units of each item.  That means I keep:\n      - Item 1: 4 - 1 = 3\n      - Item 2: 6 - 2 = 4\n      - Item 3: 6 - 1 = 5\n      - Item 4: 1 - 0 = 1\n      - Item 5: 4 - 1 = 3\n\n      My value if I accept the current offer:\n      (3 * 62) + (4 * 23) + (5 * 69) + (1 * 47) + (3 * 35) = 186 + 92 + 345 + 47 + 105 = 775\n\n   - This offer is significantly better than my outside offer of 364.\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider whether I can get a better offer by making a counteroffer. The discount factor is 0.98, which is relatively high. I need to make an offer such that the value I get in the next round is significantly higher than the value of current offer multiplied by 0.98.\n      The current offer to me is worth 775. \n      775 * 0.98 = 759.5\n\n   I would like to explore if I can get a better deal by offering Player 2 something different.\n   My Round 1 offer was [2, 3, 3, 0, 2]. This means I would have kept:\n      - Item 1: 4 - 2 = 2\n      - Item 2: 6 - 3 = 3\n      - Item 3: 6 - 3 = 3\n      - Item 4: 1 - 0 = 1\n      - Item 5: 4 - 2 = 2\n\n      My value for Round 1 offer = (2 * 62) + (3 * 23) + (3 * 69) + (1 * 47) + (2 * 35) = 124 + 69 + 207 + 47 + 70 = 517\n\n      My Round 2 offer to me is worth 775, so it makes no sense to offer something worse.\n\n   If I were to offer the same as Player 2 to me ([1, 2, 1, 0, 1]), then I would keep [3, 4, 5, 1, 3]. The value I obtain would be 775.\n   If I offer [0, 1, 0, 0, 0], I keep [4, 5, 6, 1, 4] and obtain\n      (4 * 62) + (5 * 23) + (6 * 69) + (1 * 47) + (4 * 35) = 248 + 115 + 414 + 47 + 140 = 964\n\n   Offering Player 2 [0, 1, 0, 0, 0] is a very good offer for me. I am going to make this offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is good, much better than my outside option, with value 775. However, I think I can get an even better outcome. I will make a counteroffer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]}\n",

Since it's round 3, the discount factor will be 0.98^(3-1) = 0.98^2 = 0.9604.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [1, 1, 1, 0, 1]. This means I would receive:\n    *   1 unit of Item 1: 1 * 62 = 62\n    *   1 unit of Item 2: 1 * 23 = 23\n    *   1 unit of Item 3: 1 * 69 = 69\n    *   0 units of Item 4: 0 * 47 = 0\n    *   1 unit of Item 5: 1 * 35 = 35\n    *   Total value: 62 + 23 + 69 + 0 + 35 = 189\n\n    Since this is round 3, we need to apply the discount factor: 189 * 0.9604 = 181.5156\n\n    Comparing this to my outside offer of 364, accepting the current offer (181.5156) would be a mistake since it is less than my outside offer.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Let's consider a few potential counteroffers. The goal is to find an offer that Player 2 *might* accept, while giving me a value higher than 364 (before the discount factor is applied, since they will also be applying it). Because it is the last round, and if Player 2 makes a counteroffer, it is automatically treated as a WALK, I should choose to walk away if I cannot identify an acceptable offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince it's the final round and I need a deal that is greater than my outside offer to be advantageous, and since I suspect that Player 2 is valuing Items 3 and 1 most, and is offering me items 1,2,3 and 5 in amounts of 1 each, I should walk away and take my outside offer because I have found no deals in my limited computational power that both would be considered acceptable to the other player and result in an amount greater than 364 for me.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 338. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 765 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 3, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    97 x 1 + 52 x 0 + 70 x 3 + 6 x 0 + 30 x 1\n    which is 337 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 338. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 338. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 765 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 3, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    97 x 1 + 52 x 0 + 70 x 3 + 6 x 0 + 30 x 1\n    which is 337 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 338. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 3, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 0, 3]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Current Situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value is 338.\n*   My item values are: item 1 = 97, item 2 = 52, item 3 = 70, item 4 = 6, item 5 = 30.\n*   Total items: 1 unit of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5.\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.98. This means accepting an offer now is slightly better than accepting the same offer next round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** I am being offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 3]. This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 1 - 0 = 1\n    *   Item 2: 6 - 1 = 5\n    *   Item 3: 3 - 0 = 3\n    *   Item 4: 2 - 0 = 2\n    *   Item 5: 3 - 3 = 0\n\n    My value if I accept is: (1 * 97) + (5 * 52) + (3 * 70) + (2 * 6) + (0 * 30) = 97 + 260 + 210 + 12 + 0 = 579\n    This is much better than my outside offer of 338.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer. I also want to avoid making an offer worse than my previous offer to player 2 which was [0, 3, 1, 1, 1]. This offer to Player 2 would have given me:\n    *   Item 1: 1 - 0 = 1\n    *   Item 2: 6 - 3 = 3\n    *   Item 3: 3 - 1 = 2\n    *   Item 4: 2 - 1 = 1\n    *   Item 5: 3 - 1 = 2\n    Value: (1 * 97) + (3 * 52) + (2 * 70) + (1 * 6) + (2 * 30) = 97 + 156 + 140 + 6 + 60 = 459\n\n    Let's try an offer where I keep only item 1:\n    Offer: [0, 6, 3, 2, 3]\n    Value: (1 * 97) + (0 * 52) + (0 * 70) + (0 * 6) + (0 * 30) = 97. This is much worse than my outside offer.\n\n    Let's try an offer where I keep [1,3,2,1,2]:\n    Offer: [0,3,1,1,1]\n    Value: (1 * 97) + (3 * 52) + (2 * 70) + (1 * 6) + (2 * 30) = 97 + 156 + 140 + 6 + 60 = 459\n    This is better than my outside offer and is the same as the previous offer I made.\n\n    Since accepting the current offer is worth 579 and my outside offer is 338, and I only have one round left, I should accept. I also need to avoid mistakes 4 and 5 which would result in me receiving less than 338.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\nI should ACCEPT the current offer because it's significantly better than my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 634. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 813 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 7, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    99 x 0 + 9 x 1 + 59 x 0 + 52 x 7 + 52 x 5\n    which is 633 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 634. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 2, 4, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 2, 2, 3, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 2, 3, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 634\n*   Item values: Item 1 = 99, Item 2 = 9, Item 3 = 59, Item 4 = 52, Item 5 = 52\n*   Total items: Item 1 = 4, Item 2 = 2, Item 3 = 5, Item 4 = 8, Item 5 = 5\n*   Discount factor: 0.98. This means an offer accepted in a later round is worth slightly less.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [1, 2, 2, 3, 1]. This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 4 - 1 = 3 units\n    *   Item 2: 2 - 2 = 0 units\n    *   Item 3: 5 - 2 = 3 units\n    *   Item 4: 8 - 3 = 5 units\n    *   Item 5: 5 - 1 = 4 units\n\n    Value of current offer to me: (3 * 99) + (0 * 9) + (3 * 59) + (5 * 52) + (4 * 52) = 297 + 0 + 177 + 260 + 208 = 942\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (942) is significantly better than my outside offer (634).\n\n3) **Consider a counteroffer:** Since the current offer is good, I need to consider if I could get an even better deal by making a counteroffer. However, making a counteroffer will incur a discount of 0.98 if accepted in round 3. I must be careful not to ask for too much and risk getting nothing.\n\nLet's calculate the value of my initial offer from round 1. I offered Player 2 [1, 1, 2, 4, 2], meaning I kept [3, 1, 3, 4, 3]. The value to me would have been (3 * 99) + (1 * 9) + (3 * 59) + (4 * 52) + (3 * 52) = 297 + 9 + 177 + 208 + 156 = 847.\n\nLet's consider another counteroffer. What if I offer Player 2 just a little less than their initial offer? Their initial offer to me was [1, 2, 2, 3, 1].\n\nLet's calculate a potential counteroffer where I keep one more item 2 and one more item 4.\nSo I give [1, 1, 2, 2, 1] to player 2.\nThen I keep [3, 1, 3, 6, 4]\nValue = (3 * 99) + (1 * 9) + (3 * 59) + (6 * 52) + (4 * 52) = 297 + 9 + 177 + 312 + 208 = 1003\n\nIf I get 1003 but discounted by 0.98, I get 982.94. This is still better than the current offer of 942.\n\nGiven that the current offer is significantly better than my outside offer, I am inclined to accept to avoid any risk. However, I will explore a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer and the current offer.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nBased on the analysis, I will make a counteroffer.\nI will offer [1, 1, 2, 2, 1]\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 2, 2, 1]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 634. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 813 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 7, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    99 x 0 + 9 x 1 + 59 x 0 + 52 x 7 + 52 x 5\n    which is 633 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 634. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 2, 4, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 2, 2, 3, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 2, 2, 1]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [1, 2, 2, 4, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 2, 4, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Therefore, accepting the current offer would be a mistake.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** Let's explore some potential counteroffers. Since it is the last round, offering all or nothing may be the only viable move.\n    *   Since it is the last round, if I make a counteroffer, it will be treated as a walk.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\nSince the discounted value of the current offer (475.398) is less than my outside offer (634), and I am in the final round, making a counteroffer would be treated as a walk away.

Keeps my most valuable items (items 4 and 3)\n2. Is better than my outside offer of 625\n3. Might be attractive to Player 1 based on their revealed preferences\n\nLet me try the following counteroffer:\n- Give Player 1: 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 1 unit of item 5\n- Keep for myself: 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5\n\nValue for me:\n- 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (item 1)\n- 4 \u00d7 38 = 152 (item 2)\n- 2 \u00d7 61 = 122 (item 3)\n- 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (item 4)\n- 1 \u00d7 47 = 47 (item 5)\n\nTotal value: 63 + 152 + 122 + 237 + 47 = 621\n\nThis is slightly less than my outside offer. Let me adjust.\n\nLet's try:\n- Give Player 1: 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 0 units of item 5\n- Keep for myself: 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5\n\nValue for me:\n- 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (item 1)\n- 4 \u00d7 38 = 152 (item 2)\n- 2 \u00d7 61 = 122 (item 3)\n- 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (item 4)\n- 2 \u00d7 47 = 94 (item 5)\n\nTotal value: 63 + 152 + 122 + 237 + 94 = 668\n\nThis is better than my outside offer of 625 and offers Player 1 items they seem to value (1, 2, and 4) while keeping the ones I value most.\n\n## Decision\n\nWhile Player 1's offer gives me a value of 748, which is very good, I should try to get an even better deal in the first round. My counteroffer of [3, 3, 0, 1, 0] gives me a value of 668, which is still better than my outside offer.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 4, 2, 4, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    19 x 1 + 8 x 4 + 67 x 2 + 34 x 4 + 21 x 1\n    which is 342 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 343. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This means that offers in later rounds are worth slightly less than offers in earlier rounds.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   Current offer: I am offered [3, 3, 0, 1, 0].

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 62. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 411 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 1, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    6 x 3 + 41 x 1 + 17 x 0 + 39 x 0 + 34 x 0\n    which is 59 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 62. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step to determine the optimal action in round 1.\n\n1) **Analysis of the current situation:**\n\n   - My outside offer value: 62\n   - My values for the items: item 1 = 6, item 2 = 41, item 3 = 17, item 4 = 39, item 5 = 34\n   - Total pool of items: 5 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 8 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.98. This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.98 times its value in round 1, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 0.98^2 times its value in round 1.\n\n2) **Assessment of offers:**\n\n   - Current offer: There is no current offer on the table.\n   - Potential counteroffers: I need to determine a counteroffer that maximizes my value, considering the risk of rejection and the discount factor.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\nSince it is round 1, I need to make an initial offer. My goal is to propose an offer that Player 2 is likely to accept, while still yielding a value greater than my outside offer. Given that Player 2's values are also drawn from the range [1, 101], and I don't know their specific values, it's reasonable to start with a relatively generous offer. It's unlikely I'll get a good deal by asking for almost everything.\n\nI will aim for a split that gives Player 2 slightly more than half of the total value. To achieve this, I'll initially offer a distribution that seems somewhat balanced, keeping more of the items I value less.\n\nI'll start by offering Player 2: 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\nMy values for the remaining items are:\n2 units of item 1 = 2 * 6 = 12\n2 units of item 2 = 2 * 41 = 82\n2 units of item 3 = 2 * 17 = 34\n4 units of item 4 = 4 * 39 = 156\n2 units of item 5 = 2 * 34 = 68\nMy total value = 12 + 82 + 34 + 156 + 68 = 352\nThis is much larger than my outside option. Let's offer more to the other player:\n\nLet's try offering Player 2: 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5.\nMy values for the remaining items are:\n1 units of item 1 = 1 * 6 = 6\n1 units of item 2 = 1 * 41 = 41\n1 units of item 3 = 1 * 17 = 17\n2 units of item 4 = 2 * 39 = 78\n1 units of item 5 = 1 * 34 = 34\nMy total value = 6 + 41 + 17 + 78 + 34 = 176\nThis is better than my outside option.\n\nLet's try offering Player 2: 5 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 7 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5.\nMy values for the remaining items are:\n0 units of item 1 = 0 * 6 = 0\n1 units of item 2 = 1 * 41 = 41\n1 units of item 3 = 1 * 17 = 17\n1 units of item 4 = 1 * 39 = 39\n1 units of item 5 = 1 * 34 = 34\nMy total value = 0 + 41 + 17 + 39 + 34 = 131\nThis is better than my outside option.\n\nLet's try offering Player 2: 5 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 7 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5.\nMy values for the remaining items are:\n0 units of item 1 = 0 * 6 = 0\n0 units of item 2 = 0 * 41 = 0\n1 units of item 3 = 1 * 17 = 17\n1 units of item 4 = 1 * 39 = 39\n1 units of item 5 = 1 * 34 = 34\nMy total value = 0 + 0 + 17 + 39 + 34 = 90\nThis is still better than my outside option.\n\nLet's try offering Player 2: 5 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 7 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5.\nMy values for the remaining items are:\n0 units of item 1 = 0 * 6 = 0\n0 units of item 2 = 0 * 41 = 0\n0 units of item 3 = 0 * 17 = 0\n1 units of item 4 = 1 * 39 = 39\n1 units of item 5 = 1 * 34 = 34\nMy total value = 0 + 0 + 0 + 39 + 34 = 73\nThis is still better than my outside option.\n\nLet's try offering Player 2: 5 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 8 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5.\nMy values for the remaining items are:\n0 units of item 1 = 0 * 6 = 0\n0 units of item 2 = 0 * 41 = 0\n0 units of item 3 = 0 * 17 = 0\n0 units of item 4 = 0 * 39 = 0\n1 units of item 5 = 1 * 34 = 34\nMy total value = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 34 = 34\nThis is less than my outside option.\n\nSo, the previous one, giving Player 2 [5, 5, 4, 7, 4], seems like a good start.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [5, 5, 4, 7, 4]}\n```",

Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 1, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [5, 5, 4, 7, 4]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [4, 0, 2, 2, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [4, 0, 2, 2, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

This means Player 2 received those amounts. I kept nothing of item 1, 2, 3. I kept one of item 4. I kept one of item 5. This has a total value to me of: 0*6 + 0*41 + 0*17 + 1*39 + 1*34 = 73.

This means that accepting an offer in a later round is slightly less valuable than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]. This means I receive 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5. My total value for this offer is: (0 * 60) + (0 * 82) + (0 * 22) + (1 * 16) + (1 * 99) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 16 + 99 = 115.\n*   This is greater than my outside offer of 1.\n\n3) **Consider a counteroffer:**\n\nLet's think about a counteroffer. Player 1's initial offer was [3, 2, 2, 1, 4] and Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 1].\nI currently have the offer [0, 0, 0, 1, 1].\nThis means I have 5 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 0 of item 4, and 6 of item 5.\nThis gives me a value of 5 * 60 + 4 * 82 + 4 * 22 + 0 * 16 + 6 * 99 = 300 + 328 + 88 + 0 + 594 = 1310.\nI am getting 115 so they are getting 1425 - 115 = 1310.\n\nI will make a counteroffer where I offer [2, 1, 1, 0, 3]. This means I keep [3, 3, 3, 1, 4].\nMy value would then be 3 * 60 + 3 * 82 + 3 * 22 + 1 * 16 + 4 * 99 = 180 + 246 + 66 + 16 + 396 = 904.\nThis is better than my outside offer.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nSince the current offer of 115 is greater than my outside offer of 1, it would not be a mistake to accept it. However, it might be beneficial to make a counteroffer to try to get a better deal.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 185. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 810 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    52 x 0 + 26 x 0 + 53 x 0 + 47 x 0 + 92 x 2\n    which is 184 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 185. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 1, 1, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 0, 1, 1, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 0, 1, 1, 3]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 185\n*   My values for items: 52 for item 1, 26 for item 2, 53 for item 3, 47 for item 4, 92 for item 5.\n*   Total items: 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5.\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.98. This means that if we reach an agreement in round 3, the value of the deal will be multiplied by 0.98^2 = 0.9604.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [2, 0, 1, 1, 3]. This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 2 units (4 - 2)\n    *   Item 2: 3 units (3 - 0)\n    *   Item 3: 2 units (3 - 1)\n    *   Item 4: 2 units (3 - 1)\n    *   Item 5: 2 units (5 - 3)\n    The value of this offer to me is:\n    (2 * 52) + (3 * 26) + (2 * 53) + (2 * 47) + (2 * 92) = 104 + 78 + 106 + 94 + 184 = 566\n    Since 566 > 185, accepting this offer is better than walking away right now.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Since I am in round 2, I need to take into account the discount factor of 0.98 if the negotiation continues to the next round.\n\n    Let's consider a counteroffer. My current value is 566. Player 2's previous offer was [2, 0, 1, 1, 3], meaning they would receive [2, 3, 2, 2, 2].\n\n    Let's consider a counteroffer that aims to give Player 2 a better deal than they got in the last round, but still gives me a good value. I could try offering Player 2 more of item 2 since I value it less. I could offer them [2, 1, 1, 1, 3]. This would leave me with [2, 2, 2, 2, 2], which has a value of (2*52) + (2*26) + (2*53) + (2*47) + (2*92) = 104 + 52 + 106 + 94 + 184 = 540.\n\n    Since this is slightly less than the 566 I get from accepting the current offer, but likely better for the other player, it might encourage them to accept. Let's consider if this is a good strategy with the discount factor in mind.\n\n    If I make the counteroffer, and they accept, I get 540. If they reject, I get 185.\n    If I accept the current offer, I get 566.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\nSince 566 > 185, I shouldn't walk away. Also, since I'm in round 2, the other agent will have to accept if they want to come to an agreement.\n\nThe value of accepting the current offer is 566.\nThe value of offering [2,1,1,1,3] is 540.\n\nLet's offer something slightly worse that will still benefit me more than the walk away.\n\nLet's try offering [3,0,2,2,4] to the other player. That gives me [1,3,1,1,1] giving me a value of 52 + 3*26 + 53 + 47 + 92 = 52 + 78 + 53 + 47 + 92 = 322\n\nLet's try offering [3,0,2,2,3] to the other player. That gives me [1,3,1,1,2] giving me a value of 52 + 3*26 + 53 + 47 + 2*92 = 52 + 78 + 53 + 47 + 184 = 414\n\nLet's try offering [2,0,2,2,3] to the other player. That gives me [2,3,1,1,2] giving me a value of 2*52 + 3*26 + 53 + 47 + 2*92 = 104 + 78 + 53 + 47 + 184 = 466\n\nLet's try offering [2,0,1,2,3] to the other player. That gives me [2,3,2,1,2] giving me a value of 2*52 + 3*26 + 2*53 + 47 + 2*92 = 104 + 78 + 106 + 47 + 184 = 519\n\nLet's try offering [2,0,1,1,4] to the other player. That gives me [2,3,2,2,1] giving me a value of 2*52 + 3*26 + 2*53 + 2*47 + 92 = 104 + 78 + 106 + 94 + 92 = 474\n\nIt makes sense to accept, but I want to also check for a slight counter offer to see if I can get more.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 211. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 930 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 1, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    58 x 1 + 35 x 1 + 63 x 1 + 100 x 0 + 54 x 1\n    which is 210 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 211. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 2, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 1, 2, 0, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 2, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 2, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "I'll analyze this step by step to determine my best action.\n\n1) Current situation analysis:\n   - My outside offer value: 211\n   - My item values: item 1 = 58, item 2 = 35, item 3 = 63, item 4 = 100, item 5 = 54\n   - Total pool of items: 5 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 8 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5\n   - Current discount factor: 0.98 (round 2, so value will be multiplied by 0.98)\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n\n   Current offer from Player 1: [0, 0, 2, 0, 0]\n   If I accept this offer, I would get:\n   - 5 units of item 1 = 5 \u00d7 58 = 290\n   - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 35 = 70\n   - 6 units of item 3 = 6 \u00d7 63 = 378\n   - 5 units of item 4 = 5 \u00d7 100 = 500\n   - 4 units of item 5 = 4 \u00d7 54 = 216\n   Total value = 1454 \u00d7 0.98 (discount factor for round 2) = 1424.92\n\n   This is significantly higher than my outside offer of 211.\n\n3) Analyzing Player 1's behavior:\n   - Player 1's initial offer was [0, 0, 2, 0, 0] - offering me only 2 units of item 3\n   - Player 1 rejected my counteroffer of [2, 1, 2, 0, 2]\n   - Player 1 repeated the same offer [0, 0, 2, 0, 0]\n   \n   This suggests Player 1 highly values all items except possibly item 3, or is being very stubborn.\n\n4) Decision:\n   The current offer gives me a value of 1424.92, which is much better than my outside offer of 211. If I wait another round, the discount factor will further reduce the value.\n\n   Given that Player 1 has repeated the same offer twice, they seem unwilling to budge. I should try to counter with an offer that keeps more of the items I value most (item 4) while perhaps giving up more of the items Player 1 might value.\n\n   Let me try a counteroffer of [2, 1, 3, 0, 2] - giving Player 1 slightly more of item 3 than before while keeping all of item 4 (my most valuable item).\n\n   Value of this counteroffer for me:\n   - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174\n   - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 35 = 35\n   - 5 units of item 3 = 5 \u00d7 63 = 315\n   - 5 units of item 4 = 5 \u00d7 100 = 500\n   - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 54 = 108\n   Total value = 1132 \u00d7 0.98 = 1109.36\n\n   This is still much higher than my outside offer of 211.\n\nHowever, given that Player 1 has repeated the same offer and this is round 2 of 3, I should strongly consider accepting their current offer to avoid risking an impasse in the final round.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",
