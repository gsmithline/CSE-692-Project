By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Walking away is not optimal unless a better counteroffer cannot be crafted. Therefore, I should propose a counteroffer.\n\n**Counteroffer Proposal:**\nTo ensure my offer is greater than 721, I must calculate potential divisions where I can obtain more value:\n- I need to find an allocation that maximizes value for myself while still being reasonable for Player 1.\n\nConsider the maximum allocation:\n- 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 96 = 288\n- 4 units of item 2 = 4 \u00d7 28 = 112\n- 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186\n- 5 units of item 4 = 5 \u00d7 52 = 260\n- 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258\n\nLet's make a reasonable counteroffer:\nOffer the opponent a different distribution which keeps the most valuable items for me and provides them with a reasonable share\n- Offer Player 1: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1] (total value for me with this proposal):\n  - My items: [2, 3, 2, 3, 2]\n  - My value: (2 \u00d7 96) + (3 \u00d7 28) + (2 \u00d7 62) + (3 \u00d7 52) + (2 \u00d7 86) = 192 + 84 + 124 + 156 + 172 = 728\n\nThis results in a value greater than my outside offer and could potentially be more palatable to Player 1 than the prior distribution.\n\n**Action:** \n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 1, 2, 1]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 349. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 906 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Given this, the current offer value is already relevant because future offers are discounted.\n\n### 2) Assess the value of offers:\n\n- **Current offer:** [2, 0, 1, 3, 7]\n  - Value calculation:\n    - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 2 = 4\n    - 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 16 = 0\n    - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 38 = 38\n    - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24\n    - 7 units of item 5 = 7 \u00d7 53 = 371\n  - Total value = 4 + 0 + 38 + 24 + 371 = 437\n\n- **Potential counteroffers:** Let's consider a more favorable division where I propose keeping more valuable items to see if the value exceeds the current offer:\n  - Example counteroffer: Offer [1, 1, 2, 2, 4] to Player 1, meaning I keep:\n    - Item 1: 2 units, Item 2: 1 unit, Item 3: 5 units, Item 4: 3 units, Item 5: 7 units\n  - Value calculation for me:\n    - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 2 = 4\n    - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 16 = 16\n    - 5 units of item 3 = 5 \u00d7 38 = 190\n    - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24\n    - 7 units of item 5 = 7 \u00d7 53 = 371\n  - Total value = 4 + 16 + 190 + 24 + 371 = 605\n\n- **Compare with outside offer value:** \n  - Current offer value: 437 (better than my outside offer of 18)\n  - Potential counteroffer value: 605 (would be better, but will Player 1 accept?)\n\n### 3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n\n- **Should I accept the current offer?** No, because I could potentially propose a better counteroffer.\n- **Should I walk away and take my outside offer?** No, because both the current offer and potential counteroffer are better than my outside offer.\n- **Should I propose a specific counteroffer?** Yes, proposing a counteroffer with a higher value for me is an option since it's the first round and there's room to negotiate.\n\nGiven these analyses, I will propose a counteroffer that gives me a value of 605, which is significantly higher and could potentially lead to a better deal for me:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 2, 2, 4]}",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "To make a well-informed decision, let's break down the situation step-by-step:\n\n### 1) Analyze the Current Situation:\n\n- **Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer value is 657.\n- **Values of Items**: \n  - Item 1: 10 per unit\n  - Item 2: 2 per unit\n  - Item 3: 33 per unit\n  - Item 4: 99 per unit\n  - Item 5: 81 per unit\n- **Total Pool of Items**: \n  - Item 1: 6 units\n  - Item 2: 4 units\n  - Item 3: 5 units\n  - Item 4: 3 units\n  - Item 5: 2 units\n- **Discount Factor**: The discount factor gamma is 0.98, which means the value of any deal will slightly decrease in future rounds. The actual value is adjusted by gamma to the power (r-1), so in round 1, \\( \\gamma^0 = 1 \\), and the discount does not apply yet.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n\n- **Current Offer on the Table (My Share)**: [1, 0, 4, 2, 0]\n\n  Calculation of total value if I accept:\n  - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 10 = 10\n  - 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 2 = 0\n  - 4 units of item 3 = 4 \u00d7 33 = 132\n  - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 99 = 198\n  - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 81 = 0\n  \n  Total value = 10 + 0 + 132 + 198 + 0 = 340\n\n- **Comparison with Outside Offer**:\n  - The current offer gives me a value of 340, which is significantly less than my outside offer of 657.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision Based on the Analysis:\n\nSince the current offer (340) is much lower than my outside offer (657), accepting it would mean accepting a deal worse than my fallback option, which is undesirable. According to mistake #4, I should not accept an offer worse than my outside offer. Also, I should not walk away because the negotiation might yield a better offer in future rounds. Therefore, making a counteroffer that maximizes my value while being reasonable is advisable.\n\n#### Counteroffer Strategy:\n\nI'll aim for a distribution that maximizes my value while increasing the likelihood Player 1 will consider acceptance. A better distribution for me might involve keeping more high-value items like item 4 and item 5 unrestricted.\n\n- **Possible Counteroffer**: [2, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n  \n  Here's why:\n  - Giving 2 units of item 1 and 1 unit of item 2 and none of the higher value items ensures that I'm retaining adequate high-value items to surpass my outside offer. This also gives Player 1 at least some desirable items.\n\n- **My New Value if the Counteroffer is Accepted**:\n  - 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 10 = 40\n  - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6\n  - 5 units of item 3 = 5 \u00d7 33 = 165\n  - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297\n  - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 81 = 162\n  \n  Total value = 40 + 6 + 165 + 297 + 162 = 670\n\nThis division gives me a value of 670, slightly exceeding my outside offer value of 657 while still being fair.\n\nGiven this analysis, my decision is:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 4, 2, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 1, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 4, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 4, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Let's evaluate the current situation step by step to decide on the best action.\n\n### 1) Analyze the Current Situation:\n\n- **Outside Offer Value:**\n  - My outside offer value is 657.\n\n- **Values of the Items:**\n  - Item 1 value per unit = 10\n  - Item 2 value per unit = 2\n  - Item 3 value per unit = 33\n  - Item 4 value per unit = 99\n  - Item 5 value per unit = 81\n\n- **Total Pool of Items:**\n  - 6 units of item 1\n  - 4 units of item 2\n  - 5 units of item 3\n  - 3 units of item 4\n  - 2 units of item 5\n\n- **Discount Factor:**\n  - The discount factor is gamma = 0.98. Since we are in round 2, the discount for this round is \u03b3^1 = 0.98.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n\n#### Current Offer Evaluation:\n- Current offer to me: [1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5]\n  - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 10 = 10\n  - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 2 = 2\n  - 4 units of item 3 = 4 \u00d7 33 = 132\n  - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 99 = 198\n  - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 81 = 81\n- Total value = 10 + 2 + 132 + 198 + 81 = 423\n- Discounted value = 423 \u00d7 0.98 = 414.54\n\n#### Comparison with Outside Offer:\n- My outside offer value is 657, which is higher than 414.54, the discounted value of accepting the current offer.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision Based on the Analysis:\n\n- **Current Offer:** The current offer gives a value to me that is significantly lower than my outside offer value of 657. Accepting it would violate Mistake 4 (accepting an offer worse for me than my outside offer).\n- **Walk:** Walking away guarantees me my outside offer value of 657, which is better than accepting the current offer.\n- **Counteroffer:** I need to generate a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 657. However, given my outside offer's high value, it may be challenging to propose a split favorable enough to me that Player 1 will accept unless Player 1 also has a high outside offer.\n\nSince accepting the current offer results in a value significantly below my outside offer, and it\u2019s challenging to ensure Player 1 would accept a counteroffer, the best action is to walk away.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 93. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 423 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 2, 1, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 2, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 2, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

If you accept the offer or conclude the negotiation this round, your value is multiplied by 0.98 to the power (r-1) = 0.98^(2-1) = 0.98. If you wait for round 3, the multiplier would be 0.98^(3-1) = 0.9604.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **For the current offer: What is my total value if I accept it?**  \n  The current offer gives you:\n  - 0 units of item 1: 0 \u00d7 29 = 0\n  - 0 units of item 2: 0 \u00d7 5 = 0\n  - 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 40 = 80\n  - 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 20 = 20\n  - 0 units of item 5: 0 \u00d7 47 = 0  \n  Total value if accepted: 80 + 20 = 100  \n  After discount: 100 \u00d7 0.98 = 98\n\n- **Compare this to my outside offer value:**  \n  - Current Offer Discounted Value: 98  \n  - Outside Offer Value: 93\n\nSince 98 > 93, accepting the current offer is better than the outside offer.\n\n- **For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?**  \n  We should aim for a counteroffer that gives us a value greater than 98, discounted by the negotiation round.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision Based on the Analysis\n\n- **Should I accept the current offer?**  \n  Yes, as the current offer (98) is better than your outside offer (93) and it's unlikely Player 1 will propose something significantly better in the next round considering the decreasing values due to discounting.\n\n- **Final Decision:**  \n  - Since accepting the current offer yields a higher payoff (98) than walking away (93), and even proposing a counteroffer could risk Player 1 walking away or proposing less favorable terms in a final round, the strategic move is to accept the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

Items 2 and 3 have the highest value per unit for me, so I want to keep most of those. Items 1 and 4 have lower values per unit, so I can be more generous with those.\n\nI'll propose giving Player 2:\n- 1 unit of item 1 (sacrificing 17 value)\n- 1 unit of item 2 (sacrificing 87 value)\n- 0 units of item 3 (keeping all for myself)\n- 4 units of item 4 (sacrificing 156 value)\n- 2 units of item 5 (sacrificing 130 value)\n\nTotal value I'm sacrificing: 17 + 87 + 0 + 156 + 130 = 390\nValue I'm keeping: 1092 - 390 = 702, which is well above my outside offer of 581.\n\nThis is a somewhat aggressive initial offer that still gives Player 2 a reasonable amount of items.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 333. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 573 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

In round 1, no discount is applied to the current offer value.\n\n### 2) Assess the value of offers:\n\n- **Current offer (if you accept it):** The offer on the table is [1, 1, 0, 4, 2], which means you receive:\n  - 1 unit of item 1: 1 \u00d7 70 = 70\n  - 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 28 = 28\n  - 0 units of item 3: 0 \u00d7 32 = 0\n  - 4 units of item 4: 4 \u00d7 27 = 108\n  - 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 34 = 68\n- **Total value of current offer:** 70 + 28 + 108 + 68 = 274\n\n- **Comparison to outside offer:** 274 (current offer value) vs. 333 (outside offer value). The current offer value is less than the outside offer value.\n\n### 3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n\nSince the value of the current offer (274) is less than my outside offer (333), accepting it would be Mistake 4 (accepting an offer worse for me than my outside offer).\n\nAdditionally, given the current offer is unfavorable, I should not ACCEPT it.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 3, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 3, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

If accepted in round 1, the value is not discounted. If accepted in round 2, the value would be multiplied by 0.98, and so on.\n   \n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n1. **Current Offer Analysis:**\n   - If I accept the current offer, I get [0, 2, 3, 2, 1].\n   - Value of my portion:\n     - Item 1: 0 \u00d7 33 = 0\n     - Item 2: 2 \u00d7 18 = 36\n     - Item 3: 3 \u00d7 26 = 78\n     - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 13 = 26\n     - Item 5: 1 \u00d7 19 = 19\n   - Total value = 0 + 36 + 78 + 26 + 19 = 159\n\n2. **Comparison to My Outside Offer:**\n   - My outside offer is 328, which is significantly higher than the value of the current offer (159). Hence, accepting this offer would be worse than my outside offer.\n\n3. **Potential Counteroffers:**\n   - I need to propose a counteroffer that is worth at least 328 to me, considering the total pool of items.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\n1. **Should I Accept?** \n   - No, as the value of 159 is less than my outside offer of 328.\n\n2. **Should I Walk Away?**\n   - Not immediately, as I have the opportunity to make a counteroffer that could potentially be accepted by Player 1.\n\n3. **Should I Propose a Counteroffer?**\n\n   A sensible strategy is to propose a counteroffer that could provide me with a value equal to or greater than my outside offer:\n\n   One potential counteroffer for my objective:\n   - I keep 2 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n   - This means I offer Player 1: [0, 1, 2, 1, 1]\n\n   Calculating the total value of what I keep:\n   - Item 1: 2 \u00d7 33 = 66\n   - Item 2: 5 \u00d7 18 = 90\n   - Item 3: 3 \u00d7 26 = 78\n   - Item 4: 5 \u00d7 13 = 65\n   - Item 5: 1 \u00d7 19 = 19\n   - Total value = 66 + 90 + 78 + 65 + 19 = 318\n\n   This is still slightly below my outside offer. However, increasing the items I keep further could be considered aggressive and may require multiple rounds of negotiation.\n\nGiven this, I will propose a counteroffer close to my outside offer value, while avoiding offering all items in certain categories.\n\n### Decision\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 2, 1, 1]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

I can either walk away or propose a counteroffer. To avoid mistakes, my counteroffer should be better than both the current offer and my outside offer. It's crucial to ensure that I gain a value greater than 341.\n\n   Let's construct a counteroffer that provides at least a value of 341 to me:\n\n   - Propose keeping:\n     - All units of item 1: 5 \u00d7 79 = 395 (item 1 is very valuable to me)\n     - 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 72 = 72\n     - 0 units of items 2, 4, and 5 (give these to Player 1)\n\n   - The total value for me from this counteroffer: 395 + 72 = 467\n\n   My counteroffer to Player 1:\n   - Offer [0, 2, 5, 0, 0] (meaning Player 1 gets 0 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 5 of item 3, all of item 4, and all of item 5)\n\n   This ensures I get a value of 467, which is better than my outside offer and avoids any negotiation mistakes.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 5, 0, 0]}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 57. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 915 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 9, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 9, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Let's work through the steps to analyze the current situation and determine the best action.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **What is my outside offer value?**\n  Your outside offer value is 57.\n\n- **What are the values of the items involved?**\n  - Item 1: 64 per unit (0 units available)\n  - Item 2: 100 per unit (9 units available)\n  - Item 3: 25 per unit (5 units available)\n  - Item 4: 61 per unit (4 units available)\n  - Item 5: 55 per unit (6 units available)\n\n- **What is the total pool of items?**\n  The total available items are:\n  - 0 units of item 1\n  - 9 units of item 2\n  - 5 units of item 3\n  - 4 units of item 4\n  - 6 units of item 5\n\n- **How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?**\n  The discount factor, \\(\\gamma = 0.98\\), reduces the value of future rounds by 2% per round. If the negotiation goes to the second round, any value received is multiplied by 0.98. If it goes to the third round, the value is multiplied by 0.98^2.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?**\n  The current offer gives you all 9 units of item 2 and no other items. Value from the offer:\n  - Item 2: 9 units \u00d7 100 = 900\n\n  Current offer value to you: 900\n\n- **Compare current offer value to outside offer:**\n  - Current offer value (900) is higher than outside offer (57).\n\n- **For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?**\n  Any counteroffer needs to ensure a value at least higher than my outside offer. A counteroffer should also consider retaining advantageous items while creating a plausible offer for Player 1 to accept.\n\n### Mistakes to Avoid\n\n1. **Mistake 1:** Not applicable unless in the context of changing offers.\n2. **Mistake 2:** Must not propose receiving less than 57 in equivalent value.\n3. **Mistake 3:** Ensure balanced offers with some items or avoid extreme splits.\n4. **Mistake 4:** Do not accept less than 57.\n5. **Mistake 5:** Current offer is worth more than outside offer, so walking away would be a mistake.\n\n### Decision\n\n- The current offer is worth 900 to you, which far exceeds your outside offer of 57. Accepting will not violate any of the mistakes identified.\n\nBased on this analysis, the best action is to accept the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 211. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 822 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 468. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 705 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 3, 1, 4, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 3, 1, 4, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Let's follow the step-by-step process to make an informed decision:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n1. **My outside offer value**:\n   - My outside offer value is 468.\n\n2. **Values of the items to me**:\n   - Item 1: 16 per unit\n   - Item 2: 39 per unit\n   - Item 3: 100 per unit\n   - Item 4: 45 per unit\n   - Item 5: 35 per unit\n\n3. **Total pool of items**:\n   - Item 1: 5 units\n   - Item 2: 4 units\n   - Item 3: 4 units\n   - Item 4: 7 units\n   - Item 5: 1 unit\n\n4. **Discount factor**:\n   - The discount factor is \u03b3 = 0.98. This means that the value from future rounds will decrease due to the discount applied.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n1. **Current offer (3, 3, 1, 4, 0)**:\n   - Value from 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 16 = 48\n   - Value from 3 units of item 2: 3 \u00d7 39 = 117\n   - Value from 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 100 = 100\n   - Value from 4 units of item 4: 4 \u00d7 45 = 180\n   - Value from 0 units of item 5: 0 \u00d7 35 = 0\n   - Total value: 48 + 117 + 100 + 180 + 0 = 445\n\n2. **Comparison to outside offer**:\n   - The current offer provides a value of 445, which is less than my outside offer value of 468.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\n1. **Should I accept the current offer?**\n   - No, because accepting the current offer provides a value of 445, which is less than my outside offer of 468.\n\n2. **Should I walk away and take my outside offer?**\n   - Not yet, as I have the opportunity to make a counteroffer that could yield a better result.\n\n3. **Should I propose a counteroffer?**\n   - Yes, I should propose a counteroffer that would yield a better value than my outside offer.\n\n### Counteroffer Calculation\n\nTo beat my outside offer of 468, I should try to maximize my value while ensuring Player 1 might find it acceptable. Here's a potential counteroffer:\n\n- Keep 2 units of item 1 for player 1 (offer 3 to me)\n- Keep 2 units of item 2 for player 1 (offer 2 to me)\n- Keep 1 unit of item 3 for player 1 (offer 3 to me)\n- Keep 3 units of item 4 for player 1 (offer 4 to me)\n- Offer 0 units of item 5 to player 1 (1 to me)\n- My value: (3\u00d716) + (2\u00d739) + (3\u00d7100) + (4\u00d745) + (1\u00d735) = 48 + 78 + 300 + 180 + 35 = 641\n\nThis proposed counteroffer has a value of 641 to me, which is greater than both the current offer value and my outside offer value.\n\n### My Action\n\nI will make a counteroffer as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 1, 3, 0]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

The current round is 1, so the discount factor for this round is \\(0.98^{0} = 1\\).\n\n2) **Assessing the Current Offer:**\n   - Current offer on the table (offered to me): [1 unit of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5]\n   - My value if I accept the current offer:\n     - Item 1: 1 \u00d7 79 = 79\n     - Item 2: 0 \u00d7 57 = 0\n     - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 29 = 58\n     - Item 4: 0 \u00d7 60 = 0\n     - Item 5: 4 \u00d7 92 = 368\n     - Total value = 79 + 0 + 58 + 0 + 368 = 505\n\n3) **Decision Making:**\n   - The current offer's value (505) is significantly less than my outside offer (932).\n   - Accepting this offer would be a mistake (Mistake 4), as it provides a value worse than my outside offer.\n   - My goal is to maximize my outcome, aiming for at least my outside offer value of 932.\n\nGiven the analysis, it is not beneficial for me to accept the current offer. Therefore, I should not accept it. Instead, I should consider making a counteroffer that maximizes my value closer to or above my outside offer value. Let's propose a counteroffer to keep a fair and high-value portion of the items for myself.\n\nTo propose a counteroffer, I can consider retaining:\n- 3 units of item 1 (value 3 \u00d7 79 = 237)\n- 2 units of item 2 (value 2 \u00d7 57 = 114)\n- 1 unit of item 3 (value 1 \u00d7 29 = 29)\n- 1 unit of item 4 (value 1 \u00d7 60 = 60)\n- 4 units of item 5 (value 4 \u00d7 92 = 368)\n\nThis results in my total value being 808. While this is still below my outside offer, it provides a better negotiation position than the current offer and opens up for further negotiation.\n\nRegarding the items I am offering to Player 1:\n- 1 unit of item 1\n- 1 unit of item 2\n- 2 units of item 3\n- 1 unit of item 4\n- 2 units of item 5\n\nSo, the counteroffer will be: [1, 1, 2, 1, 2].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 2, 1, 2]}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 0, 4, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 0, 4, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

This affects the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers. In the first round, the discount is negligible, but its impact increases in subsequent rounds.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n- **Current Offer**:\n  - Offer to me: [0, 2, 0, 4, 0]\n  - Total value to me if I accept: \n    - Item 2: 2 \u00d7 32 = 64\n    - Item 4: 4 \u00d7 16 = 64\n    - Total value = 64 + 64 = 128\n\n- **Comparison to Outside Offer**:\n  - The current offer value (128) is significantly higher than my outside offer (48).\n\n- **Potential Counteroffers**:\n  - I need to propose an offer that maximizes my value while considering the likelihood of acceptance by Player 1. It should be more beneficial than my outside offer and should remain competitive with accepting the current offer.\n\n### 3) Decision:\n- **Accept the Current Offer**: The current offer value to me is 128, which is much greater than the outside offer value of 48.\n- **Mistake Avoidance**: Accepting the current offer avoids Mistake 5 (Walking away from an offer better than the outside offer) since the current offer gives me a much higher value.\n\nConsidering that the current offer is significantly better than my outside offer and already provides a substantial portion of the items, I will accept the current offer to ensure a favorable outcome.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 922. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 922. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 888 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 203. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 639 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 0, 0, 5]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 0, 0, 5]\n\n    What is your action?

A clear thought is essential, which proposes a similar amount above outside offer.\n\nThus, it is safer to WALK to avoid any more rounds of potential stalemate.\n\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",
