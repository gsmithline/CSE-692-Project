                    "prompt": "\n    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\n    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\n    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\n    There are 5 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 8 units of item 5 to divide.\n    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\n    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 101.\n    Your private values are 13 for item 1, 76 for item 2, 17 for item 3, 11 for item 4, 69 for item 5.\n    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to your total value of all items, which is 910. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 462. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 462. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 558 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 6, 0, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    13 x 0 + 76 x 2 + 17 x 6 + 11 x 0 + 69 x 3\n    which is 461 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 462. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To make an informed decision, let's follow the outlined steps:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **My Outside Offer Value:** 462\n- **Values of the Items Involved:** \n  - Item 1: 13\n  - Item 2: 76\n  - Item 3: 17\n  - Item 4: 11\n  - Item 5: 69\n- **Total Pool of Items:**\n  - 5 units of Item 1\n  - 2 units of Item 2\n  - 7 units of Item 3\n  - 2 units of Item 4\n  - 8 units of Item 5\n- **Discount Factor Influence:** The discount factor of 0.98 means that the value of the negotiation outcome decreases by 2% per round. It is crucial to consider how much value I can accumulate now versus waiting for potentially diminishing returns in subsequent rounds.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\nThere is no current offer from Player 2. I need to propose an initial offer that maximizes my value while remaining above my outside offer.\n\nLet's consider the maximum potential value I can get if I keep everything:\n\n- Value = (5 \u00d7 13) + (2 \u00d7 76) + (7 \u00d7 17) + (2 \u00d7 11) + (8 \u00d7 69) = 65 + 152 + 119 + 22 + 552 = 910 (this is the total value if I keep all items, not a realistic offer).\n\nNow, let's search for a division that maximizes my return, ensuring it's better than my outside offer (462).\n\n**Iterative Calculation of Counteroffer Proposals:**\n\nProposal: Keep 3 of Item 1, 1 of Item 2, 4 of Item 3, 1 of Item 4, and 5 of Item 5 (offer the rest to Player 2)\n\n- Value = (3 \u00d7 13) + (1 \u00d7 76) + (4 \u00d7 17) + (1 \u00d7 11) + (5 \u00d7 69)\n- Value = 39 + 76 + 68 + 11 + 345 = 539\n\n539 is better than my outside offer value of 462. Player 2 would receive 2 of Item 1, 1 of Item 2, 3 of Item 3, 1 of Item 4, and 3 of Item 5.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nSince the counteroffer has a higher value than my outside offer and is likely suitable for an initial round negotiation, I should propose this offer.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 3, 1, 3]}\n```",

A feasible approach should maintain the 92 value per unit with bridging around other sturdy value items.\n  \n- Propose taking all units of item 1, 6 of item 2, 2 of item 3, none of item 4, 2 of item 5:\n- Calculate my value:\n  - Item 1: 2 \u00d7 92 = 184\n  - Item 2: 6 \u00d7 29 = 174\n  - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 59 = 118\n  - Item 4: 0 \u00d7 48 = 0\n  - Item 5: 2 \u00d7 65 = 130\n\nValue to me = 184 + 174 + 118 + 130 = 606\n\nAgain, below the outside offer.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 4, 4, 2, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    92 x 2 + 29 x 4 + 59 x 4 + 48 x 2 + 65 x 3\n    which is 827 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 836. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 6, 0, 0, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 6, 0, 0, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 391. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 391. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 729 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 5, 1, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    20 x 0 + 82 x 1 + 20 x 5 + 34 x 1 + 87 x 2\n    which is 390 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 391. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

This means it's slightly preferable to achieve a deal earlier rather than later, provided the offer is beneficial.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n- **Current offer:** No items are on the table, as no offers have been made yet.\n- **Potential counteroffer exploration:**\n  - Suppose I propose to keep fewer units of highly valuable items or offer fewer items to Player 2 to maximize my value.\n\n### Strategy for Initial Offer:\nTo prevent mistake 2 (offering worse than my outside offer), I need to ensure my counteroffer results in a value greater than 391.\n\n**Proposal Calculation:**\nLet's test a division where I keep 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5, and offer the rest.\n\n- Value to me:\n  - Item 1: 1 \u00d7 20 = 20\n  - Item 2: 1 \u00d7 82 = 82\n  - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 20 = 40\n  - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 34 = 68\n  - Item 5: 3 \u00d7 87 = 261\n- Total value = 20 + 82 + 40 + 68 + 261 = 471\n\nSince 471 is greater than my outside offer of 391, this initial proposal is reasonable and avoids mistake 2.

This is unlikely since the value of the current offer (411) is quite significant, and multiplied by the discount factor, 411*0.98 = 402.78, will most probably be lower than a counteroffer, so the optimal decision is to accept the offer at hand, as waiting to see if a slightly better deal is possible is not worth the risk.\n\nTherefore, I will accept the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 315. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player1, 2 units of each item (keeping 2 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 816 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [4, 3, 1, 0, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [4, 3, 1, 0, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 0, 5, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    70 x 0 + 7 x 2 + 61 x 0 + 5 x 5 + 28 x 1\n    which is 67 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 68. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

If the negotiation concludes this round, the value is not discounted. If it goes to round 3, a discount factor of \\( \\gamma = 0.98 \\) will apply to the outcome.\n\n### 2) Assessing the Current Offer and Potential Counteroffers:\n\n- **Current Offer to Me: `[0, 0, 2, 0, 3]`**\n  - The value to me:\n    - 0 units of item 1: \\(0 \\times 70 = 0\\)\n    - 0 units of item 2: \\(0 \\times 7 = 0\\)\n    - 2 units of item 3: \\(2 \\times 61 = 122\\)\n    - 0 units of item 4: \\(0 \\times 5 = 0\\)\n    - 3 units of item 5: \\(3 \\times 28 = 84\\)\n  - Total value to me: \\(0 + 0 + 122 + 0 + 84 = 206\\)\n\nGiven that this value (206) is much higher than my outside offer (68), I should not walk away.\n\n- **Potential Counteroffers:**\n  - Let's determine a counteroffer that maximizes my value but is fair.\n  - My previous offer was `[1, 2, 2, 0, 1]`. Let's analyze that:\n    - Value: \n      - 1 unit of item 1: \\(1 \\times 70 = 70\\)\n      - 2 units of item 2: \\(2 \\times 7 = 14\\)\n      - 2 units of item 3: \\(2 \\times 61 = 122\\)\n      - 0 units of item 4: \\(0 \\times 5 = 0\\)\n      - 1 unit of item 5: \\(1 \\times 28 = 28\\)\n    - Total: \\(70 + 14 + 122 + 0 + 28 = 234\\)\n  - This offer already provides a higher value than the current offer.\n\n### 3) Decision:\n\n- **Accepting Current Offer:** The current offer gives me a value of 206.\n- **Walking Away:** My outside offer gives me a value of 68.\n- **Proposing a Counteroffer:** My previous counteroffer `[1, 2, 2, 0, 1]` gave me a value of 234, which is higher than both the current offer and my outside offer.\n\nConsidering this analysis, it would be wise to propose a counteroffer more favorable than both the current offer and my outside offer.\n\n### Counteroffer Strategy:\n\nPlayer 2's behavior (offering no units of items 1, 2, and 4) might suggest lower values for those items. An effective counteroffer should maintain a good balance of items and be more advantageous to me. Let's aim to get 1 more unit of a valuable item (item 3 or 5) to surpass my previous offer.\n\nProposed **Counteroffer:** `[1, 0, 2, 0, 2]`\n- For Player 2: [1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5]\n- For Me:\n  - 1 unit of item 1: \\(1 \\times 70 = 70\\)\n  - 0 unit of item 2: \\(0 \\times 7 = 0\\)\n  - 3 units of item 3: \\(3 \\times 61 = 183\\)\n  - 0 unit of item 4: \\(0 \\times 5 = 0\\)\n  - 2 units of item 5: \\(2 \\times 28 = 56\\)\n  - Total value for me: \\(70 + 0 + 183 + 0 + 56 = 309\\)\n\nThis counteroffer gives me 309, considerably higher than my outside offer and the current offer from Player 2.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 2, 0, 2]}\n```",

My outside offer is 740, and the discount factor is 0.98.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the current offer to me:\n*   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 65 = 65\n*   0 units of item 2: 0 * 14 = 0\n*   2 units of item 3: 2 * 51 = 102\n*   0 units of item 4: 0 * 90 = 0\n*   2 units of item 5: 2 * 11 = 22\nTotal value of current offer: 65 + 0 + 102 + 0 + 22 = 189\n\nNow we need to consider what I would keep if I accept this offer. The total units of each item are 2, 2, 5, 6, 4.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 0, 2, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    17 x 1 + 19 x 0 + 78 x 0 + 62 x 2 + 76 x 1\n    which is 217 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 218. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the current offer and decide on the best action. The current offer allocates [3, 5, 0, 1, 2] to me. This means I get:\n\n*   3 units of item 1\n*   5 units of item 2\n*   0 units of item 3\n*   1 unit of item 4\n*   2 units of item 5\n\nMy values are: 89, 26, 45, 49, 25\n\nTherefore, the value of this offer to me is:\n\n(3 * 89) + (5 * 26) + (0 * 45) + (1 * 49) + (2 * 25) = 267 + 130 + 0 + 49 + 50 = 496\n\nMy outside offer is 530. Since the current offer (496) is less than my outside offer (530), accepting is worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. I need to decide what I want, and what I think Player 1 might accept. Since I have the advantage of going second and there are only 3 rounds, I need to aim for a deal close to my ideal. A fair split would be one where we each get around half of the total value (1155 for me, so ~577.5 for me). Given the discount factor, I'd rather walk than get something substantially less than my outside offer in round 3. Let's propose a counteroffer where I keep more of item 1 (my highest value item). How about giving Player 1:\n\n*   Item 1: 2 units\n*   Item 2: 4 units\n*   Item 3: 1 unit\n*   Item 4: 1 unit\n*   Item 5: 3 units\n\nThis would leave me with:\n\n*   Item 1: 4 units\n*   Item 2: 5 units\n*   Item 3: 1 unit\n*   Item 4: 2 units\n*   Item 5: 3 units\n\nThe value of this offer to me would be:\n\n(4 * 89) + (5 * 26) + (1 * 45) + (2 * 49) + (3 * 25) = 356 + 130 + 45 + 98 + 75 = 704\n\nThis is higher than my outside offer of 530, so it is worthwhile to propose.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 4, 1, 1, 3]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 0, 2, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    17 x 1 + 19 x 0 + 78 x 0 + 62 x 2 + 76 x 1\n    which is 217 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 218. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

I need to offer Player 1 some amount of each item. The goal is to find an offer that Player 1 might accept, and that gives me a value greater than my outside option (discounted by 0.98 for round 2). I don't know Player 1's values, so I'll start by offering a split that favors myself somewhat but seems \"reasonable\". I will try offering Player 1 half of each item, rounded down if necessary.\n\nCounteroffer:\n* Item 1: 3 units (leaving me with 3 units)\n* Item 2: 2 units (leaving me with 2 units)\n* Item 3: 1 unit (leaving me with 1 unit)\n* Item 4: 1 unit (leaving me with 2 units)\n* Item 5: 1 unit (leaving me with 1 unit)\n\nMy value for this counteroffer would be:\n(3 * 100) + (2 * 57) + (1 * 67) + (2 * 34) + (1 * 38) = 300 + 114 + 67 + 68 + 38 = 587\nIn round 2 my value will be 587 * 0.98 = 575.26\nSince 575.26 < 771, this offer is not a great choice for me.\n\nI will make a counteroffer that will guarantee me a better value than my outside offer in round 2. To get 771 / 0.98 = 786.73, I need a total value of 786.73.\nLets try a counteroffer: [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]. That would give me:\n(5 * 100) + (3 * 57) + (2 * 67) + (3 * 34) + (2 * 38) = 500 + 171 + 134 + 102 + 76 = 983.\nThis is way better than my outside offer so I need to give away more.\nI want to make sure I get more than 786.73/0.98\nLet's try a counteroffer of [2, 1, 0, 0, 0]\nMy value will be:\n(4 * 100) + (3 * 57) + (2 * 67) + (3 * 34) + (2 * 38) = 400 + 171 + 134 + 102 + 76 = 883\nStill better than outside offer.\nLet's try a counteroffer of [2, 2, 0, 0, 0]\nMy value will be:\n(4 * 100) + (2 * 57) + (2 * 67) + (3 * 34) + (2 * 38) = 400 + 114 + 134 + 102 + 76 = 826\nStill better than outside offer.\nLet's try a counteroffer of [2, 2, 1, 0, 0]\nMy value will be:\n(4 * 100) + (2 * 57) + (1 * 67) + (3 * 34) + (2 * 38) = 400 + 114 + 67 + 102 + 76 = 759\n\n759 < 771\n\nSo I will offer [2, 2, 0, 0, 0].

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 0, 0, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    29 x 4 + 82 x 0 + 94 x 0 + 57 x 0 + 11 x 1\n    which is 127 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 129. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

For later rounds, the value of offers decreases due to this factor, so it is advantageous to secure a favorable deal early if possible.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n#### Possible Offers:\nLet's evaluate a few potential initial offers and their value to me:\n  - **Offer [2, 2, 1, 1, 2] (3, 2, 2, 2, 2 kept for me):**\n    - Value from keeping:\n      - Item 1: 3 \u00d7 14 = 42\n      - Item 2: 2 \u00d7 61 = 122\n      - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 11 = 22\n      - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 35 = 70\n      - Item 5: 2 \u00d7 24 = 48\n    - Total = 42 + 122 + 22 + 70 + 48 = 304 (Too low)\n\n  - **Offer [2, 2, 0, 0, 1] (3, 2, 3, 3, 3 kept for me):**\n    - Value from keeping:\n      - Item 1: 3 \u00d7 14 = 42\n      - Item 2: 2 \u00d7 61 = 122\n      - Item 3: 3 \u00d7 11 = 33\n      - Item 4: 3 \u00d7 35 = 105\n      - Item 5: 3 \u00d7 24 = 72\n    - Total = 42 + 122 + 33 + 105 + 72 = 374 (Too low)\n\n  - **Offer [1, 1, 0, 0, 0] (4, 3, 3, 3, 4 kept for me):**\n    - Value from keeping:\n      - Item 1: 4 \u00d7 14 = 56\n      - Item 2: 3 \u00d7 61 = 183\n      - Item 3: 3 \u00d7 11 = 33\n      - Item 4: 3 \u00d7 35 = 105\n      - Item 5: 4 \u00d7 24 = 96\n    - Total = 56 + 183 + 33 + 105 + 96 = 473 (Still too low)\n\n  - **Offer [0, 1, 0, 0, 0] (5, 3, 3, 3, 4 kept for me):**\n    - Value from keeping:\n      - Item 1: 5 \u00d7 14 = 70\n      - Item 2: 3 \u00d7 61 = 183\n      - Item 3: 3 \u00d7 11 = 33\n      - Item 4: 3 \u00d7 35 = 105\n      - Item 5: 4 \u00d7 24 = 96\n    - Total = 70 + 183 + 33 + 105 + 96 = 487 (Still too low)\n\n  - **Offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (5, 4, 3, 3, 4 kept for me):**\n    - Value from keeping:\n      - Item 1: 5 \u00d7 14 = 70\n      - Item 2: 4 \u00d7 61 = 244\n      - Item 3: 3 \u00d7 11 = 33\n      - Item 4: 3 \u00d7 35 = 105\n      - Item 5: 4 \u00d7 24 = 96\n    - Total = 70 + 244 + 33 + 105 + 96 = 548 (Higher than my outside offer, so acceptable)\n\nThis is better than my guaranteed fallback value. By choosing an offer that keeps [5, 4, 3, 3, 4] items, I can exceed my outside offer, ensuring my value exceeds 523. However, offering no items could be seen as suboptimal negotiation behavior in initial rounds, aligning with Mistake 3 as outlined.\n\nInstead, for the negotiation process, I'll make an initial reasonable offer to potentially gather information about Player 2's preferences and leave room for subsequent adjustments.\n\n### Step 3: Decide and Act\nGiven my analysis, I'll offer Player 2 a minimal offer allowing myself to gather insights without drastically hurting my overall potential value.\n\n**Propose an initial offer: [1, 2, 1, 1, 2] leaving me (4, 2, 2, 2, 2). The proposed value I keep is:**\n- Item 1: 4 \u00d7 14 = 56\n- Item 2: 2 \u00d7 61 = 122\n- Item 3: 2 \u00d7 11 = 22\n- Item 4: 2 \u00d7 35 = 70\n- Item 5: 2 \u00d7 24 = 48\n- Total = 56 + 122 + 22 + 70 + 48 = 318\n\nThis offer needs adjusting to suit the given outside and fallback value optimally.\n\nTherefore, my action:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]}\n``` \n\nThis suggests a start, but adjustments will be required based on Player 2's responses, so I attain higher than my fallback value while adhering to Mistake prevention strategies outlined earlier.",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 4, 3, 3, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    14 x 3 + 61 x 4 + 11 x 3 + 35 x 3 + 24 x 4\n    which is 520 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 523. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 2, 0, 2, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    93 x 1 + 84 x 2 + 54 x 0 + 62 x 2 + 34 x 1\n    which is 419 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 420. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 4, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 5, 5, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [3, 1, 1, 2, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 1, 1, 2, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\nThe current offer on the table is [3, 1, 1, 2, 2], meaning Player 1 is offering me 3 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n\nMy private values are:\n- Item 1: 32\n- Item 2: 9\n- Item 3: 6\n- Item 4: 41\n- Item 5: 41\n\nLet's calculate the value of the current offer to me:\n- 3 units of item 1: 3 * 32 = 96\n- 1 unit of item 2: 1 * 9 = 9\n- 1 unit of item 3: 1 * 6 = 6\n- 2 units of item 4: 2 * 41 = 82\n- 2 units of item 5: 2 * 41 = 82\nTotal value = 96 + 9 + 6 + 82 + 82 = 275\n\nNow, we need to consider the discount factor. We are in round 2, so the discount factor is 0.98^(2-1) = 0.98.\nDiscounted value of current offer = 275 * 0.98 = 269.5\n\nMy outside offer is 248. Since 269.5 > 248, accepting the current offer is better than walking away *right now*.\n\nHowever, let's quickly consider what the maximum possible value I could achieve is. This would be if I got ALL the items. This value is (4*32) + (5*9) + (5*6) + (3*41) + (2*41) = 128 + 45 + 30 + 123 + 82 = 408. I can't expect to get that, but I should see if I can improve the offer.\n\nThe other player is offering [3, 1, 1, 2, 2]. The total number of items is [4, 5, 5, 3, 2]. That means player 1 is getting [1, 4, 4, 1, 0]\nValue for player 1: (1 * v1_1) + (4 * v1_2) + (4 * v1_3) + (1 * v1_4) + (0 * v1_5), where v1_i is player 1s value for item i.\n\nSince I am in round 2, and I'm comparing the current offer to the outside offer, I'll accept the current offer as it is higher than my outside offer, because if I counter offer at this point, if player 1 refuses, then the game ends, and I get my walkaway which is less than accepting.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 6. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 831 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    51 x 0 + 34 x 0 + 35 x 0 + 59 x 0 + 98 x 0\n    which is 0 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 6. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

This factor influences the negotiation by decreasing the value of the deal if it takes multiple rounds to conclude. Thus, maximizing the value of items taken sooner is advantageous.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - As it's currently round 1, there is no offer on the table.\n   - My total value if I end up with all items:\n     - 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 51 = 102\n     - 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 34 = 68\n     - 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 35 = 35\n     - 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 59 = 118\n     - 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 98 = 196\n     - Total value: 102 + 68 + 35 + 118 + 196 = 519\n\n   - Compare this with my outside offer value of 6: It's reasonable to aim for a division where my value is considerably higher than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nGiven that this is the first round and I have no information on Player 2's preferences, my strategy is to make a counteroffer that keeps my total value substantially higher than my outside offer while remaining fair and potentially acceptable for Player 2.\n\nLet's propose a counteroffer where I keep most of the higher-value items:\n\n- I offer Player 2:\n  - 1 unit of item 1 (worth 51 each)\n  - 1 unit of item 2 (worth 34 each)\n\nSo, my proposal will be as follows:\n\n- I keep:\n  - 1 unit of item 1: 51\n  - 1 unit of item 2: 34\n  - 1 unit of item 3: 35\n  - 2 units of item 4: 118\n  - 2 units of item 5: 196\n- Total value for me = 51 + 34 + 35 + 118 + 196 = 434\n\nAs this value is significantly higher than my outside offer, it is a strong initial position.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "To make a decision, I'll follow the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n   - My outside offer value is 6.\n   - My private values for the items are:\n     - Item 1: 51\n     - Item 2: 34\n     - Item 3: 35\n     - Item 4: 59\n     - Item 5: 98\n   - Total pool of items: 2 units of Item 1, 2 units of Item 2, 1 unit of Item 3, 2 units of Item 4, 2 units of Item 5.\n   - The discount factor, gamma, is 0.98. It slightly decreases the value of accepting future offers as the number of rounds increases.\n\n2. **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current Offer to Me:** [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n     - Item 1: 1 unit \u00d7 51 = 51\n     - Item 2: 1 unit \u00d7 34 = 34\n     - Item 3: 0 units \u00d7 35 = 0\n     - Item 4: 0 units \u00d7 59 = 0\n     - Item 5: 0 units \u00d7 98 = 0\n     - Total value = 51 + 34 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 85\n\n   - **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to propose a division that maximizes my total value and is still better than my outside offer of 6. Avoid mistakes as mentioned.\n\n     To gain more value, I could consider keeping high-value items like Item 5.\n\n     Let's consider making a counteroffer where I keep all units of Item 5 and some units of other items that yield a high value if possible while ensuring the total division does not go below my outside offer:\n\n     Example counteroffer: [1, 1, 1, 0, 0], i.e., I keep all units of Item 5. Calculate the value:\n     - Item 1: 1 unit \u00d7 51 = 51\n     - Item 2: 1 unit \u00d7 34 = 34\n     - Item 3: 1 unit \u00d7 35 = 35\n     - Item 4: 0 units \u00d7 59 = 0\n     - Item 5: 0 units \u00d7 98 = 0\n     - My value if I keep [1, 1, 1, 0, 2] = 51 + 34 + 35 + 0 + 196 = 316\n\n3. **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   The current offer provides a total value of 85, which is significantly better than my outside offer of 6. Walking away from this offer would be a mistake, as it is substantially better than my outside fallback. Additionally, since the current offer from Player 2 matches the one I proposed in round 1, and each of us is maintaining the same stance, the likelihood of achieving a better outcome through a counteroffer appears low. Therefore, I should accept the current offer to ensure a value of 85 without risking suboptimal outcomes in the final round.\n\n   Therefore, my decision is to ACCEPT the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 147. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 750 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 3, 0, 3, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    32 x 1 + 33 x 3 + 87 x 0 + 3 x 3 + 95 x 0\n    which is 140 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 147. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

The goal is to retain items that maximize my value while ensuring that the offer I propose is better than my outside offer value (147) and motivates Player 2 to engage.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n- **Developing a Counteroffer:**\n  - Keeping high-value items such as item 3 and item 5 is beneficial, while I could offer more of items that potentially might not be of high value due to the opponent's action in future rounds.\n  - One potential offer could be to focus on retaining items 3 and 5 wherever possible and distributing more of item 4, which has less value to me.\n\nLet's put forth an offer and calculate the resultant value to me:\n\nOffer: Give Player 2 the following items:\n- [1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 unit of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5]\n\nMy items remaining:\n- 2 units of item 1\n- 2 units of item 2\n- 3 units of item 3\n- 0 units of item 4\n- 3 units of item 5\n\nValue to me for this division:\n- \\(2 \\times 32 = 64\\) (item 1)\n- \\(2 \\times 33 = 66\\) (item 2)\n- \\(3 \\times 87 = 261\\) (item 3)\n- \\(0 \\times 3 = 0\\) (item 4)\n- \\(3 \\times 95 = 285\\) (item 5)\n- Total Value: 676\n\nThis offer results in a value of 676, which is significantly better than my outside offer (147).

This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 3, 0, 3, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    32 x 1 + 33 x 3 + 87 x 0 + 3 x 3 + 95 x 0\n    which is 140 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 147. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 3, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 2, 2, 2, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 2, 2, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - **My outside offer value:** 147\n   - **Values of items involved:** \n     - Item 1: 32\n     - Item 2: 33\n     - Item 3: 87\n     - Item 4: 3\n     - Item 5: 95\n   - **Total pool of items:** \n     - 3 units of item 1\n     - 3 units of item 2\n     - 3 units of item 3\n     - 3 units of item 4\n     - 5 units of item 5\n   - **Discount factor:** As this is round 2, the discount factor is \\( \\gamma^1 = 0.98 \\). This means that any deal accepted would be valued at 98% of its face value right now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer (accepting all items offered to me [0, 2, 2, 2, 3]):**\n     - Item 1: 0 units = 0\n     - Item 2: 2 units = 2 \u00d7 33 = 66\n     - Item 3: 2 units = 2 \u00d7 87 = 174\n     - Item 4: 2 units = 2 \u00d7 3 = 6\n     - Item 5: 3 units = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285\n     - Total value = 66 + 174 + 6 + 285 = 531\n     - After applying discount (0.98): 531 \u00d7 0.98 = 520.38\n\n   Since 520.38 is significantly higher than my outside offer of 147, walking away from this offer would be suboptimal.\n\n   - **Previous counteroffer ([1, 1, 0, 3, 2] offered by me):** \n     - Kept: [2, 2, 3, 0, 3]\n     - Item 1: 2 units = 2 \u00d7 32 = 64 \n     - Item 2: 2 units = 2 \u00d7 33 = 66\n     - Item 3: 3 units = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261\n     - Item 4: 0 units = 0\n     - Item 5: 3 units = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285\n     - Total value = 64 + 66 + 261 + 0 + 285 = 676\n     - After applying discount (0.98): 676 \u00d7 0.98 = 662.48\n\n   662.48 is still higher than accepting the current offer, but slightly lower than the previous offer when not adjusted for the discount.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\n   Based on the analysis:\n   - Accepting the current offer gives me an adjusted value of 520.38, which is still higher than my outside offer.\n   - My previous counteroffer gave me an adjusted value of 662.48, but it's uncertain if Player 2 would agree to that or if further rounds will benefit me more due to diminishing returns with the discount factor.\n\nThe current offer is quite favorable, well above my outside offer and it represents a strong gain relative to potential further offers when the discount is factored in. To avoid Mistake 5, I should not pass up on a deal which is much better than my outside offer.\n\nGiven these considerations, I will accept the current offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 718. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 718. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 693 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions.

                    "response": "Let's analyze the current situation step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n- **Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer value is 718.\n  \n- **Values of the Items Involved**:\n  - Item 1: 21 per unit\n  - Item 2: 38 per unit\n  - Item 3: 50 per unit\n  - Item 4: 76 per unit\n  - Item 5: 46 per unit\n  \n- **Total Pool of Items**: \n  - 3 units of item 1\n  - 2 units of item 2\n  - 3 units of item 3\n  - 6 units of item 4\n  - 7 units of item 5\n  \n- **Discount Factor**: The discount factor, gamma, is 0.98. This means the value of any deal decreases slightly in future rounds due to the discount factor. Therefore, achieving a favorable deal sooner rather than later is preferred, unless improving an offer substantially.\n\n### Step 2: Assessing Offers\n- **Current Offer**: There is no current offer on the table. So we need to propose an initial offer.\n  \n- **Potential Counteroffers**: \n  We need to devise a fair initial offer that ensures my value from the negotiation exceeds 718, my outside offer value.\n\nLet's propose an offer where Player 2 receives some items, providing a reasonable distribution. I'll calculate a distribution proposal that maximizes my value and ensures it exceeds my outside offer.\n\n#### Calculation for a Potential Offer:\nSuppose I keep 3 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5, offering the rest to Player 2.\n\n- My value:\n  - Item 1: 3 units x 21 = 63\n  - Item 2: 1 unit x 38 = 38\n  - Item 3: 1 unit x 50 = 50\n  - Item 4: 3 units x 76 = 228\n  - Item 5: 4 units x 46 = 184\n- Total Value = 563\n  \nNow let's attempt another combination as the current doesn't exceed 718.\n\nSuppose I keep 3 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5:\n\n- My value:\n  - Item 1: 3 units x 21 = 63\n  - Item 2: 0 unit x 38 = 0\n  - Item 3: 2 units x 50 = 100\n  - Item 4: 4 units x 76 = 304\n  - Item 5: 4 units x 46 = 184\n- Total Value = 651\n\nLet's try another attempt aiming for the exceeding combination:\n\nSuppose I keep 3 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5:\n\n- My value:\n  - Item 1: 3 units x 21 = 63\n  - Item 2: 0 unit x 38 = 0\n  - Item 3: 3 units x 50 = 150\n  - Item 4: 5 units x 76 = 380\n  - Item 5: 3 units x 46 = 138\n- Total Value = 731\n\nThis distribution gives me a total value of 731, which exceeds my outside offer of 718. \n\n### Step 3: Decision\nBased on the analysis, I should propose a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than my outside offer of 718. I'll propose the following offer:\n\n- **Offer**: I offer 0 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 4 units of item 5 to Player 2.\n\nLet's format this into an appropriate response:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 0, 1, 4]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 214. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 876 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 7, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    62 x 0 + 78 x 0 + 10 x 7 + 74 x 1 + 68 x 1\n    which is 212 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 214. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To decide on my action for this negotiation, I first need to evaluate the current situation and determine my optimal strategy.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n- **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer is 214.\n- **Values of the Items:** \n  - Item 1: 62\n  - Item 2: 78\n  - Item 3: 10\n  - Item 4: 74\n  - Item 5: 68\n- **Total Pool of Items:**\n  - Item 1: 4 units\n  - Item 2: 4 units\n  - Item 3: 7 units\n  - Item 4: 3 units\n  - Item 5: 5 units\n\nThe total value of all items for me is 1192. However, we must consider the value of offers based on individual item distribution.\n\n- **Discount Factor Influence:** A discount factor of 0.98 implies that values reduce with each round. Immediate action has the highest present value.\n\n### Step 2: Assess Value of Offers\n- **Current Offer:** There is currently no offer on the table.\n- **Potential Counteroffers:**\n  - If I keep all items: Total value = 1192 (same as before calculation)\n  - Assess a viable dividing proposal that keeps my total value above 214 (my outside offer).\n\n#### Trial Offer for Counteroffer:\nLet's propose an offer where I try to keep a higher share of items with higher per-unit value for me. For instance:\n- Keep 2 units of item 1\n- Keep 2 units of item 2\n- Keep 1 units of item 3\n- Keep 2 units of item 4\n- Keep 3 units of item 5\n\nThis leaves:\n- Item 1: 2 units to Player 2\n- Item 2: 2 units to Player 2\n- Item 3: 6 units to Player 2\n- Item 4: 1 unit to Player 2\n- Item 5: 2 units to Player 2\n\n**Calculate Total Value:**\n- Value from items I'm keeping:\n  - 2\u00d762 (Item 1) = 124\n  - 2\u00d778 (Item 2) = 156\n  - 1\u00d710 (Item 3) = 10\n  - 2\u00d774 (Item 4) = 148\n  - 3\u00d768 (Item 5) = 204\n- Total = 642\n\nThis is far greater than my outside offer of 214, hence a good start.\n\n### Step 3: Decision Making\nGiven the current lack of offers, initiating a counteroffer is my best strategy. I'm proposing to offer Player 2 the following initial division that ensures I secure a value above my outside offer:\n\n```python\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 6, 1, 2]}\n```\n\nThis move ensures my retained value is well above my outside offer, adheres to strategic considerations, and potentially initiates a favorable preliminary division of items.",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 482. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 482. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1038 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 0, 2, 0, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    56 x 3 + 95 x 0 + 71 x 2 + 67 x 0 + 57 x 3\n    which is 481 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 482. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

The value of accepting an offer early is slightly higher than waiting for future offers, as the value is adjusted by \\(\\gamma^{r-1}\\).\n\n2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n\n   - There is currently no offer from Player 2 to consider.\n   - I need to determine a counteroffer that maximizes my value and is greater than my outside option of 482, while ensuring that I don't make mistakes such as offering too much away.\n\n3) Make a Decision:\n\nSince there is no offer from Player 2, I need to propose an initial offer. Let's calculate the value for different distributions and find one that exceeds my outside offer value. \n\nA reasonable start might be offering items with lesser unit contributions to my total value:\n\nLet's propose offering:\n- 2 units of item 1 (keeping 3)\n- 0 units of item 2 (keeping 2)\n- 2 units of item 3 (keeping 2)\n- 1 unit of item 4 (keeping 1)\n- 2 units of item 5 (keeping 3)\n\n**My Value Calculation**:\n- 3 units of item 1 = \\(3 \\times 56 = 168\\)\n- 2 units of item 2 = \\(2 \\times 95 = 190\\)\n- 2 units of item 3 = \\(2 \\times 71 = 142\\)\n- 1 unit of item 4 = \\(1 \\times 67 = 67\\)\n- 3 units of item 5 = \\(3 \\times 57 = 171\\)\n\n**Total Value**: \\(168 + 190 + 142 + 67 + 171 = 738\\)\n\nThis value is well above my outside offer of 482.\n\nHence, I will propose the above offer as my initial counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 2, 1, 2]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 0, 2, 0, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    56 x 3 + 95 x 0 + 71 x 2 + 67 x 0 + 57 x 3\n    which is 481 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 482. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the current offer and determine the best course of action for Player 2.\n\nThe current offer to Player 2 is [1, 2, 4, 2, 3]. This means Player 1 is offering me 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n\nMy private values are:\n- Item 1: 90\n- Item 2: 23\n- Item 3: 71\n- Item 4: 6\n- Item 5: 70\n\nCalculating the value of the current offer to me:\n- 1 unit of item 1: 1 * 90 = 90\n- 2 units of item 2: 2 * 23 = 46\n- 4 units of item 3: 4 * 71 = 284\n- 2 units of item 4: 2 * 6 = 12\n- 3 units of item 5: 3 * 70 = 210\nTotal value of current offer = 90 + 46 + 284 + 12 + 210 = 642\n\nMy outside offer value is 1044.\n\nSince the current offer's value (642) is less than my outside offer (1044), I should not accept.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. My goal is to get an offer that is worth more than 1044 to me.\n\nLet's consider offering Player 1 half of the items. This would mean offering them: 1 unit of item 1, 3.5 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5. I will round this and then give the remainder to myself. So let's try offering them [1, 3, 4, 2, 3]. This means I keep: 1 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 2 of item 4, and 3 of item 5.\n\nValue to me:\n1 * 90 + 4 * 23 + 4 * 71 + 2 * 6 + 3 * 70 = 90 + 92 + 284 + 12 + 210 = 688.\n\nIf I offer player 1 everything, I get 0. If I offer player 1 nothing, I get:\n2 * 90 + 7 * 23 + 8 * 71 + 4 * 6 + 6 * 70 = 180 + 161 + 568 + 24 + 420 = 1353.\nSo my maximum possible value is 1353.\n\nLet's try to make a counteroffer. I will offer Player 1 a deal that gives me slightly more than my outside offer, accounting for the discount factor.\n\nI want to achieve a value greater than 1044 / 0.98 = 1065.30.\n\nConsider offering Player 1 [0, 3, 4, 1, 3]\nMy value would be: 2 * 90 + 4 * 23 + 4 * 71 + 3 * 6 + 3 * 70 = 180 + 92 + 284 + 18 + 210 = 784\nThat's still less than 1065.\nSo let's offer a very minimal amount to player 1, and see if they accept.\nLet's offer Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. My value is 1353.\nThat is my best outcome, but player 1 will probably reject.\nSo if I offer player 1 [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]. My value is:\n2 * 90 + 6 * 23 + 8 * 71 + 4 * 6 + 6 * 70 = 180 + 138 + 568 + 24 + 420 = 1330.\nThis is less than 1353.\n\nI think it's likely Player 1 will reject any counteroffer. I should counteroffer and see what Player 1 does next round.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 3, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    30 x 0 + 77 x 0 + 92 x 0 + 31 x 3 + 96 x 5\n    which is 573 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 574. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 4, 2, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Since we are in round 2, the effective value of a deal will be multiplied by 0.98 to the power of 1 (gamma^(r-1)).\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n1. **Current Offer Value**:\n   - 0 units of item 1: 0 \u00d7 30 = 0\n   - 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 77 = 77\n   - 0 units of item 3: 0 \u00d7 92 = 0\n   - 0 units of item 4: 0 \u00d7 31 = 0\n   - 0 units of item 5: 0 \u00d7 96 = 0\n   - Total without discount = 77\n   - Total with discount (gamma^1) = 77 \u00d7 0.98 = 75.46\n\n   The total value of accepting the current offer is 75.46, which is much less than my outside offer of 574.\n\n2. **Potential Counteroffer**:\n   Let's find a division where I can get more than my outside offer value.

To maximize my value, I need to figure out what Player 1's values might be. I don't have that information, but I know that their values are uniformly distributed between 1 and 101. Since I want to maximize my profit and only have one round left to negotiate, I will make a counteroffer that gives Player 1 a share that is a slight improvement for them, while giving me a good profit. Let's consider an equal division. That would mean I offer Player 1 the following: [1, 3, 4, 2, 3].\n\n*   Item 1: 1 unit * 90 = 90\n*   Item 2: 4 unit * 23 = 92\n*   Item 3: 4 unit * 71 = 284\n*   Item 4: 2 unit * 6 = 12\n*   Item 5: 3 unit * 70 = 210\nTotal value of the counteroffer to me = 90 + 92 + 284 + 12 + 210 = 688\nMy discounted value in the next round is 688 * 0.98 = 674.24\nI will try offering [1, 3, 4, 2, 3] to see what happens.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 3, 4, 2, 3]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 574. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 978 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 3, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    30 x 0 + 77 x 0 + 92 x 0 + 31 x 3 + 96 x 5\n    which is 573 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 574. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 4, 2, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 2, 1, 1]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [1, 3, 4, 2, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 3, 4, 2, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

Therefore, negotiating quickly could increase the value of a final agreement.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n1. **Current Offer:**\n   - There's no current offer to me from Player 2. Therefore, we need to consider what would be an advantageous offer from my perspective.\n\n2. **Potential Initial Offer (Counteroffer):**\n   - I need to propose a distribution where my share of the items offers higher value than my outside offer of 521. \n   - Let\u2019s evaluate my values based on some hypothetical distributions.\n\n   **Example Offer for Player 2:**\n   - Give [0, 0, 1, 0, 3] to Player 2 (meaning I keep 3 units of item 1, 2 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 2 of item 4, and 4 of item 5).\n   - Calculate my value for this distribution:\n     - Remaining for me:\n       - 3 units of item 1 \u00d7 52 = 156\n       - 2 units of item 2 \u00d7 90 = 180\n       - 3 units of item 3 \u00d7 66 = 198\n       - 2 units of item 4 \u00d7 86 = 172\n       - 4 units of item 5 \u00d7 88 = 352\n     - Total value for me = 156 + 180 + 198 + 172 + 352 = 1058\n\n   This value (1058) clearly exceeds my outside offer value of 521, making it a strong proposal from my perspective.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nGiven the above calculations and reasoning, I will propose my initial offer for this negotiation round to Player 2.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the current offer and determine the best course of action for Player 2.\n\nThe current offer is [0, 0, 1, 0, 3], meaning Player 1 is offering me 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n\nMy values per unit are:\n- Item 1: 10\n- Item 2: 88\n- Item 3: 52\n- Item 4: 66\n- Item 5: 59\n\nTherefore, the value of the current offer to me is:\n(0 * 10) + (0 * 88) + (1 * 52) + (0 * 66) + (3 * 59) = 0 + 0 + 52 + 0 + 177 = 229\n\nMy outside offer is 771. Since 229 < 771, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. The goal is to find an offer that Player 1 might accept and that is worth more than 771 to me, accounting for the discount factor in later rounds. It's Round 1, so the discount factor is 0.98^(1-1) = 1.\n\nI have 3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 7 units of item 5.\n\nLet's try to construct a counteroffer that gives Player 1 a decent amount while still leaving me with more than 771. I will offer player 1 less valuable items to myself and keep the more valuable items.\n\nLet's offer Player 1: 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 3, and 4 units of item 5. This means I keep 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5 for myself.\nValue for Player 2 in this counteroffer: (1 * 10) + (2 * 88) + (3 * 52) + (2 * 66) + (3 * 59) = 10 + 176 + 156 + 132 + 177 = 651. This is still less than my outside offer.\n\nLet's try another offer where I try to get closer to my reservation value. This is tricky because I don't know player 1's valuation of the items.\n\nLet's try offering Player 1: 1 unit of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5. This means I keep 2 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5 for myself.\nValue for Player 2 in this counteroffer: (2 * 10) + (2 * 88) + (2 * 52) + (2 * 66) + (4 * 59) = 20 + 176 + 104 + 132 + 236 = 668. This is still less than my outside offer.\n\nGiven that it is the first round, and the offers calculated so far result in a value less than my outside offer, I will make an aggressive counteroffer.\n\nI will offer Player 1: 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5.\nValue for Player 2 in this counteroffer: (3 * 10) + (2 * 88) + (4 * 52) + (2 * 66) + (7 * 59) = 30 + 176 + 208 + 132 + 413 = 959\n\nThis is the maximum possible value.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 521. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1146 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 1, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    52 x 2 + 90 x 0 + 66 x 1 + 86 x 1 + 88 x 3\n    which is 520 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 521. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 1, 0, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 0, 2, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    65 x 1 + 98 x 0 + 97 x 0 + 83 x 2 + 40 x 0\n    which is 231 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 234. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 3, 2, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 3, 3, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 3, 3, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\n**Current Offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 1, 3, 3, 0] units of items 1 through 5, respectively.\n\n**My Values:** My values per unit are 33, 40, 43, 44, and 36 for items 1 through 5.\n\n**Calculating Value of Current Offer:**\n* Item 1: 1 * 33 = 33\n* Item 2: 1 * 40 = 40\n* Item 3: 3 * 43 = 129\n* Item 4: 3 * 44 = 132\n* Item 5: 0 * 36 = 0\n* Total Value: 33 + 40 + 129 + 132 + 0 = 334\n\n**Discount Factor:** We are in round 2, so the discount factor is 0.98^(2-1) = 0.98\n\n**Discounted Value:** 334 * 0.98 = 327.32\n\n**Outside Offer:** My outside offer is 819.\n\nSince 327.32 is significantly less than my outside offer of 819, I should not accept the current offer. Now, I should consider whether making a counteroffer is worthwhile.  The final round is next, so if I make a counteroffer it will be treated as a WALK. Therefore, walking is my optimal decision.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 1, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    18 x 1 + 17 x 1 + 46 x 1 + 55 x 0 + 98 x 1\n    which is 179 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 180. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

It is ideal to reach an agreement sooner rather than later to maximize my payoff.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n- **Potential Counteroffers:**\n  In my first move, I aim to propose a division that maximizes my value while ensuring it is more than my outside offer of 180. I need to propose a division where my total value is significantly above my outside fallback value.\n\nLet's consider keeping the majority of the more valuable items (from my valuation perspective): Items 3, 4, and 5.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 1, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    18 x 1 + 17 x 1 + 46 x 1 + 55 x 0 + 98 x 1\n    which is 179 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 180. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 4, 2, 4, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 2, 0, 7, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 2, 0, 7, 3]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Let's analyze the current situation step by step and make a decision.\n\n### 1) Analyze the Current Situation:\n\n- **Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer value is 180.\n\n- **Values of the Items**:\n  - Item 1: 18\n  - Item 2: 17\n  - Item 3: 46\n  - Item 4: 55\n  - Item 5: 98\n\n- **Total Pool of Items**:\n  - Item 1: 4 units\n  - Item 2: 7 units\n  - Item 3: 5 units\n  - Item 4: 8 units\n  - Item 5: 4 units\n\n- **Discount Factor Influence**: The discount factor, gamma = 0.98, means that if I defer acceptance to the next round (round 3), the value would decrease due to the discounting effect.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 282. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player1, 2 units of each item (keeping 2 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 366 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 3, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 3, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the current offer and decide on the best action for Player 2.\n\nThe current offer from Player 1 is [0, 0, 3, 1, 2]. This means Player 1 is offering me:\n- 0 units of item 1\n- 0 units of item 2\n- 3 units of item 3\n- 1 unit of item 4\n- 2 units of item 5\n\nThis would leave Player 2 with:\n- 1 unit of item 1\n- 1 unit of item 2\n- 2 units of item 3 (5 - 3 = 2)\n- 1 unit of item 4 (2 - 1 = 1)\n- 2 units of item 5 (4 - 2 = 2)\n\nNow, let's calculate the value of this offer to Player 2:\n- 1 unit of item 1: 1 * 14 = 14\n- 1 unit of item 2: 1 * 19 = 19\n- 2 units of item 3: 2 * 56 = 112\n- 1 unit of item 4: 1 * 16 = 16\n- 2 units of item 5: 2 * 17 = 34\nTotal value = 14 + 19 + 112 + 16 + 34 = 195\n\nMy outside offer is 282.  Since 195 < 282, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away. Therefore, I should make a counteroffer that's more beneficial than 282, if possible.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer that gives player 1 very little. How about giving Player 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means Player 2 gets everything.\nThe value of getting everything is:\n- 1 unit of item 1: 1 * 14 = 14\n- 1 unit of item 2: 1 * 19 = 19\n- 5 units of item 3: 5 * 56 = 280\n- 2 units of item 4: 2 * 16 = 32\n- 4 units of item 5: 4 * 17 = 68\nTotal value = 14 + 19 + 280 + 32 + 68 = 413\n\nSince 413 > 282, offering [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] is a better outcome if Player 1 accepts. But Player 1 will likely reject this offer.\n\nLet's aim for something closer to my outside offer. If I give Player 1 [1, 1, 5, 2, 4], my value is 0 which is lower than my outside offer.\n\nLet's aim for something between the first offer and giving player 1 everything. How about offering half of everything in each item? I would not be able to do exactly half, so I need to round. I can give Player 1 [0, 0, 2, 1, 2].\nThis would leave Player 2 with:\n- 1 unit of item 1: 1\n- 1 unit of item 2: 1\n- 3 units of item 3: 3\n- 1 unit of item 4: 1\n- 2 units of item 5: 2\n\nMy value is:\n- 1 unit of item 1: 1 * 14 = 14\n- 1 unit of item 2: 1 * 19 = 19\n- 3 units of item 3: 3 * 56 = 168\n- 1 unit of item 4: 1 * 16 = 16\n- 2 units of item 5: 2 * 17 = 34\nTotal value = 14 + 19 + 168 + 16 + 34 = 251.\nThis value is less than the outside offer.\n\nIn order to exceed the outside offer value, let me test offering player 1 [0, 0, 1, 0, 1].\n\nThis would leave Player 2 with:\n- 1 unit of item 1: 1\n- 1 unit of item 2: 1\n- 4 units of item 3: 4\n- 2 unit of item 4: 2\n- 3 units of item 5: 3\n\nMy value is:\n- 1 unit of item 1: 1 * 14 = 14\n- 1 unit of item 2: 1 * 19 = 19\n- 4 units of item 3: 4 * 56 = 224\n- 2 unit of item 4: 2 * 16 = 32\n- 3 units of item 5: 3 * 17 = 51\nTotal value = 14 + 19 + 224 + 32 + 51 = 340\n\nSince 340 > 282, this is a more favorable option if player 1 accepts.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 0, 1]}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 3, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    49 x 0 + 75 x 0 + 71 x 3 + 13 x 1 + 27 x 3\n    which is 307 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 310. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 3, 1, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 1, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 1, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?
