If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    30 x 0 + 13 x 0 + 30 x 1 + 62 x 0 + 40 x 0\n    which is 30 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 38. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Thus, the present value of the negotiation outcome is not discounted.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\nSince there is no current offer on the table, I need to propose an initial offer that ensures my value exceeds my outside offer of 38.\n\nLet's try to gauge what division might result in a better value than my outside offer:\n- To maximize my value, focus on retaining more units of higher-value items while still offering an acceptable division.\n\nLet's start by proposing what I might keep:\n\n1. **Initial Proposal (Retain High-Value Items)**\n   - Retain 3 units of item 1 (3 x 30 = 90)\n   - Retain 1 unit of item 2 (1 x 13 = 13)\n   - Retain 3 units of item 3 (3 x 30 = 90)\n   - Retain 1 unit of item 4 (1 x 62 = 62)\n   - Retain 1 unit of item 5 (1 x 40 = 40)\n\nCalculate total value if I keep this:\n- Total Value = 90 + 13 + 90 + 62 + 40 = 295\n\nThen, offer Player 2:\n- 2 units of item 1 (total of 5, so 5 - 3 = 2 offered)\n- 3 units of item 2 (total of 4, so 4 - 1 = 3 offered)\n- 1 unit of item 3 (total of 4, so 4 - 3 = 1 offered)\n- 2 units of item 4 (total of 3, so 3 - 1 = 2 offered)\n- 2 units of item 5 (total of 3, so 3 - 1 = 2 offered)\n\nThis offer leaves me with a total value of 295, which is significantly higher than my outside offer of 38.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- I should propose the counteroffer since my total value (295) greatly exceeds the outside offer (38).\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 3, 1, 2, 2]}\n```\n\nThis offer allows me to retain higher value items while presenting a fair distribution, and it ensures my negotiated value is much higher than the fallback value of walking away with the outside offer.",

Since we're in the first round, any acceptance or counteroffer does not yet reduce the value due to discounting.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer**: There is no current offer on the table.\n  \n- **Assess Potential Counteroffers**:\n  - The goal is to propose an offer that ensures a value above my outside offer of 441.\n  - Evaluate a few potential offers:\n    - If I propose keeping all units for myself, my total value is 850, which is obviously great, but not realistic to propose as a counteroffer.\n\n  - Finding realistic splits:\n    - A possible proposal could be to keep more high-value items while giving away lower-value items. \n    - Consider keeping:\n      - 1 unit of item 1 for me, 2 for Player 2\n      - 3 units of item 2 for me, 1 for Player 2\n      - 2 units of item 3 for me, 1 for Player 2\n      - 5 units of item 4 for me, 1 for Player 2\n      - 2 units of item 5 for me, 1 for Player 2\n    - Calculate my value:\n      - Item 1: 1 x 37 = 37\n      - Item 2: 3 x 10 = 30\n      - Item 3: 2 x 8 = 16\n      - Item 4: 5 x 69 = 345\n      - Item 5: 2 x 87 = 174\n      - Total value = 602, which is greater than my outside offer of 441.\n  \nI have ensured this proposal offers me a value greater than my fallback position outside offer.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nSince there\u2019s no current offer on the table and I've calculated a counteroffer that gives me more than my outside offer, here is my decision:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 1, 1, 1]}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 3, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1089. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 774 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 3, 1, 4, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    76 x 4 + 11 x 3 + 7 x 1 + 77 x 4 + 87 x 5\n    which is 1087 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1089. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 2, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 2, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "To decide on the right action, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer is valued at 1089.\n- **Values of Items**: My values per unit are:\n  - Item 1: 76\n  - Item 2: 11\n  - Item 3: 7\n  - Item 4: 77\n  - Item 5: 87\n\n- **Total Pool of Items**:\n  - 5 units of item 1\n  - 3 units of item 2\n  - 4 units of item 3\n  - 4 units of item 4\n  - 5 units of item 5\n\n- **Discount Factor**: Gamma = 0.98. As such, accepting earlier rounds yields a better value due to smaller discounting. \n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer [2, 1, 2, 0, 1]**:\n\n  For myself, I get:\n  - 3 units of item 1 (76 x 3 = 228)\n  - 2 units of item 2 (11 x 2 = 22)\n  - 2 units of item 3 (7 x 2 = 14)\n  - 4 units of item 4 (77 x 4 = 308)\n  - 4 units of item 5 (87 x 4 = 348)\n  \n  Total value to me = 228 + 22 + 14 + 308 + 348 = 920\n\n  If I accept this offer in round 1, I receive a value of 920.\n  \n- **Comparison to Outside Offer**:\n  - The value of 920 if I accept is less than my outside offer of 1089.\n\n### Step 3: Decision Making\n\n1. **Accept the Current Offer?**\n   - The current offer yields 920, which is less than my outside offer of 1089. Therefore, accepting is not a good idea.\n\n2. **Walk away?**\n   - My outside offer is 1089, which is better than the value of the current offer.\n\n3. **Propose a Counteroffer?**\n   - I need to create a counteroffer that yields more than 1089 to me. Let's consider offering most of the less valued items to improve the offer value on my end.\n\n   To keep a value higher than 1089, I will aim to keep more high-value items (items 1, 4, and 5):\n\n   Counteroffer keeping for myself: [3, 2, 1, 3, 4]:\n   - 3 units of item 1 (76 x 3 = 228)\n   - 2 units of item 2 (11 x 2 = 22)\n   - 1 unit of item 3 (7 x 1 = 7)\n   - 3 units of item 4 (77 x 3 = 231)\n   - 4 units of item 5 (87 x 4 = 348)\n\n   Total = 228 + 22 + 7 + 231 + 348 = 836\n\n   This is still below 1089. Let me adjust once more to see if I can increase my value:\n\n   Counteroffer keeping for myself: [3, 1, 1, 2, 4]:\n   - 3 units of item 1 (76 x 3 = 228)\n   - 1 unit of item 2 (11 x 1 = 11)\n   - 1 unit of item 3 (7 x 1 = 7)\n   - 2 units of item 4 (77 x 2 = 154)\n   - 4 units of item 5 (87 x 4 = 348)\n\n   Total = 228 + 11 + 7 + 154 + 348 = 748\n\n   Adjusting further:\n\n   Let's offer [2, 0, 2, 3, 1] - keeping [3, 3, 2, 1, 4]\n   \n   Computing value for me:\n   - 3 units of item 1 (76 x 3 = 228)\n   - 3 units of item 2 (11 x 3 = 33)\n   - 2 units of item 3 (7 x 2 = 14)\n   - 1 units of item 4 (77 x 1 = 77)\n   - 4 units of item 5 (87 x 4 = 348)\n\n   Total = 228 + 33 + 14 + 77 + 348 = 700\n\nKeeping adjusting, let's be more aggressive in terms of 1 an 2:\n\nOffer [1, 0, 2, 3, 1] - keeping [4, 3, 2, 1, 4]\n   \n   Computing value for me:\n   - 4 units of item 1 (76 x 4 = 304)\n   - 3 units of item 2 (11 x 3 = 33)\n   - 2 units of item 3 (7 x 2 = 14)\n   - 1 units of item 4 (77 x 1 = 77)\n   - 4 units of item 5 (87 x 4 = 348)\n\n   Total = 304 + 33 + 14 + 77 + 348 = 776\n\nLet me include a bit of all items, checking counter-offer [1, 0, 0, 2, 1] - keeping [4, 3, 4, 2, 4].\n   \n   Computing value for me:\n   - 4 units of item 1 (76 x 4 = 304)\n   - 3 units of item 2 (11 x 3 = 33)\n   - 4 units of item 3 (7 x 4 = 28)\n   - 2 units of item 4 (77 x 2 = 154)\n   - 4 units of item 5 (87 x 4 = 348)\n\n   Total = 304 + 33 + 28 + 154 + 348 = 867\n\nThe counteroffer will be set so that I aim again at [4, 3, 1, 4, 5]:\n\nCOUNTEROFFER [0, 0, 3, 0, 0] - keeping [5, 3, 1, 4, 5]\n\nComputing value:\n  - 5 units of item 1 (76 x 5 = 380)\n  - 3 units of item 2 (11 x 3 = 33)\n  - 1 units of item 3 (7 x 1 = 7)\n  - 4 units of item 4 (77 x 4 = 308)\n  - 5 units of item 5 (87 x 5 = 435)\n\nTotal = 380 + 33 + 7 + 308 + 435 = 1163\nThis total is higher than my outside offer of 1089.\n\nNow, with resolved the computation provided, we have my final response:\n\nFinal Conclusion:\n- The initial offer of [2, 1, 2, 0, 1] yields 920 which is below my outside offer.\n- Continuous iterations tweaking the final offer a bit better than counter and maintaining is ensuring at minimum retention as well as outside offer.\n\nThis counter-intuitive alternating to achieve through is the theoretical maximum minimum offer so the Proposal is counter-offering if this would resolve Player 1 to re-consider with this counter-offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 3, 0, 0]}",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 3, 1, 4, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    76 x 4 + 11 x 3 + 7 x 1 + 77 x 4 + 87 x 5\n    which is 1087 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1089. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 2, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 3, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 2, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 2, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

However, an optimized offer to Player 1 should ensure that it doesn't significantly deter their interest. So maximizing with possible agreement within future discount rounds. Let's try another optimized possible offer:\n\n   Keeping [4, 3, 4, 4, 5] (my entire preference of items lacks):\n\n   My counter-proposal: [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]:\n   - This keeps my entire calculated value intact, ensuring my total direct value is above my outside offer, comfortably leading on alternative overlapping items for value\u2019s sake \u2013 should it get processed via optimal segments moving forward.\n\n   Since the offer doesn\u2019t surpass outsideference, my decision stays:\n\n   {\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

This means the value decreases slightly with each round, so I prefer resolving the negotiation sooner rather than later if possible.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n   - There's currently no offer on the table.\n   - I need to decide on an initial offer. I want to ensure that my offer value remains higher than my outside offer of 483.\n\nAn effective strategy is to focus on keeping the items which are worth the most to me, such as item 3, which has the highest per-unit value at 68.\n\n3) **Make a Decision:**\n   - Making a reasonable offer to Player 2:\n     - I could keep all of item 3 (worth the most to me) and some of item 5, which is also valuable, while offering a fair share of item 1 and item 4 to Player 2.\n     - Calculate the value of retaining certain items vs. the ones I offer.\n\nFor instance:\n- Keep all 6 units of item 3: 6 \u00d7 68 = 408\n- Keep 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 58 = 116\n- Keep 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 16 = 32\n- Offer the rest to Player 2: 2 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 1 unit of item 5.\n\nValue of my counteroffer for myself:\n- Total value = 408 + 116 + 32 = 556\n\nThis value is significantly higher than my outside offer of 483, making it an attractive offer for me, and likely credible for Player 2.\n\nTherefore, my action is to make a counteroffer with the specified division of items.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 0, 1, 1]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 453. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 750 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 3, 0, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    8 x 0 + 68 x 0 + 54 x 3 + 62 x 0 + 58 x 5\n    which is 452 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 453. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 6, 4, 4, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    67 x 4 + 43 x 6 + 2 x 4 + 62 x 4 + 98 x 3\n    which is 1076 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1083. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

                    "response": "To begin the negotiation, let's analyze the situation systematically using the provided guidelines:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n- **Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer value is 1083.\n- **Values of the Items**:\n  - Item 1: 67 per unit\n  - Item 2: 43 per unit\n  - Item 3: 2 per unit\n  - Item 4: 62 per unit\n  - Item 5: 98 per unit\n\n- **Total Pool of Items**:\n  - 4 units of item 1\n  - 7 units of item 2\n  - 4 units of item 3\n  - 4 units of item 4\n  - 3 units of item 5\n\n- **Discount Factor**: The discount factor \u03b3 = 0.98 is important to consider, but since this is round 1, the discount has not taken effect yet.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\nSince there is no current offer from Player 2, the focus should be on constructing a strong initial offer.\n\n### Constructing a Potential Counteroffer:\nThe goal is to come up with a counteroffer that maximizes my value while being superior to my outside offer value of 1083:\n\n1. Propose keeping maximum units of the most valuable items.\n2. Calculate the potential value of keeping these units.\n3. Ensure the total value is greater than the outside offer.\n\nLet's try an allocation where I keep the items based primarily on their value to me, but also leave Player 2 with a reasonable share to encourage a deal:\n\n- **Retain the following units**:\n  - 4 units of item 1 for me (leaving 0 for Player 2)\n  - 5 units of item 2 for me (leaving 2 for Player 2)\n  - 4 units of item 3 for me (leaving 0 for Player 2)\n  - 3 units of item 4 for me (leaving 1 for Player 2)\n  - 2 units of item 5 for me (leaving 1 for Player 2)\n\n**My total value from this allocation**:\n- Item 1: 4 units \u00d7 67 = 268\n- Item 2: 5 units \u00d7 43 = 215\n- Item 3: 4 units \u00d7 2 = 8\n- Item 4: 3 units \u00d7 62 = 186\n- Item 5: 2 units \u00d7 98 = 196\n\n**Total Value** = 873\n\nSince the total value of 873 is less than 1083, I'll need to adjust my retention to increase my total value.\n\nReassessment of allocation:\n- Retain more of the high-value item, Item 5, and reconsider Item 4, considering their values contribute significantly to the total.\n\nNew Proposed Allocation:\n- Retain 4 units of item 1\n- Retain 6 units of item 2\n- Retain 4 units of item 3\n- Retain 3 units of item 4\n- Retain 3 units of item 5\n\n### Calculation of New Total Value:\n- Item 1: 4 \u00d7 67 = 268\n- Item 2: 6 \u00d7 43 = 258\n- Item 3: 4 \u00d7 2 = 8\n- Item 4: 3 \u00d7 62 = 186\n- Item 5: 3 \u00d7 98 = 294\n\n**Total Value** = 1014\n\n### Action Decision:\nGiven that the proposed value of 1014 from retaining the stated units is still less than my guaranteed outside offer of 1083, an optimal initial choice would be to reconsider the allocation reality and make a counteroffer that balances my retention of the most valuable items and incentivizes Player 2.\n\nHowever, a feasible initial counteroffer right now is prefabricating the totals I've aligned below and offering minimal to Player 2:\n\nI'll make a **COUNTEROFFER** offering Player 2 fewer units of items such that my retained total value surpasses my outside offer. \n\nI will propose:\n- Offer 0 units of item 1\n- Offer 2 units of item 2\n- Offer 0 units of item 3\n- Offer 1 unit of item 4\n- Offer 0 units of item 5\n\nTherefore, my action will be:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 0, 1, 0]}\n```\n\nThis proposal gives me a high total value, acknowledging an error would be:\n\nSubtracting the other's value probability, I can adjust in real-time offers without making the uncalculated risks by keeping the valuable items where gaps allow less conflict in their possible future arrangement within the scope of Player 2's agreeable values.\n",

We can start by evaluating a rough estimation of claiming the items with the highest value to me primarily. \n\n3) Make a decision:\n   - I should propose a counteroffer. The goal is to keep items that give me a higher value than 1083. \n\nNow let's attempt a counteroffer:\n\nIf I keep more of the high-value items for myself:\n   - Keep: [4, 5, 4, 4, 2] (since the total is [4, 7, 4, 4, 3])\n     - Recalculated value for this allocation:\n     - Item 1: 4 \u00d7 67 = 268\n     - Item 2: 5 \u00d7 43 = 215\n     - Item 3: 4 \u00d7 2 = 8\n     - Item 4: 4 \u00d7 62 = 248\n     - Item 5: 2 \u00d7 98 = 196\n     - Total value = 935\n\nThis offer is still below my outside offer, so I need to adjust it to increase my total value.\n\nLet's counteroffer [0, 2, 0, 0, 1] for Player 2:\n   - Items I keep: [4, 5, 4, 4, 2] (total pool - offer)\n   - Value: \n     - Item 1: 4 \u00d7 67 = 268\n     - Item 2: 5 \u00d7 43 = 215\n     - Item 3: 4 \u00d7 2 = 8\n     - Item 4: 4 \u00d7 62 = 248\n     - Item 5: 2 \u00d7 98 = 196\n     - Total value before discount: 935\n\nAt this point, it seems I cannot improve my position enough to cross the outside value through the allocation iteration.\n\nGiven the severe gap, walking away seems reasonable to secure my higher outside offer. \n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 4, 0, 3, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    70 x 0 + 94 x 4 + 45 x 0 + 42 x 3 + 52 x 0\n    which is 502 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 504. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 0, 0, 3, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    84 x 3 + 87 x 0 + 33 x 0 + 60 x 3 + 60 x 4\n    which is 672 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 675. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To decide on the initial action, let's walk through the step-by-step process:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer value is 675. This means that if I walk away, I will receive a value of 675.\n  \n- **Values of the Items**:\n  - Item 1: 84\n  - Item 2: 87\n  - Item 3: 33\n  - Item 4: 60\n  - Item 5: 60\n  \n- **Total Pool of Items**: \n  - 4 units of item 1\n  - 1 unit of item 2\n  - 2 units of item 3\n  - 9 units of item 4\n  - 4 units of item 5 \n\n- **Discount Factor**: The discount factor (\\(\\gamma = 0.98\\)) influences the value of offers over the rounds. Accepting later offers reduces their effective value by \\(\\gamma^{(r-1)}\\). Hence, it is beneficial to accept a fair offer early rather than waiting and letting the discount erode its value.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\nSince there is currently no offer from Player 2, I need to consider creating an initial offer. My goal is to propose a division that results in a value greater than 675 to myself.\n\nTo maximize my value, I should prioritize keeping more valuable items: \n\n- **Value Calculation for Keeping Certain Units**: \n  I want to test different divisions and find a division that provides me with at least 675 in value.\n\n  Let's calculate keeping majority shares of valuable items.\n\n- **Sample Proposal**:\n  - Keep: [2, 0, 1, 5, 2] and Offer Player 2: [2, 1, 1, 4, 2]\n\n  **Calculation**:\n  - 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 84 = 168\n  - 0 units of item 2: 0 \u00d7 87 = 0\n  - 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 33 = 33\n  - 5 units of item 4: 5 \u00d7 60 = 300\n  - 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 60 = 120\n  - **Total Value** = 168 + 0 + 33 + 300 + 120 = 621\n\nSince 621 is less than my outside offer of 675, I need a more favorable division to propose.\n\nLet's adjust further:\n\n- **New Proposal**:\n  - Keep: [3, 0, 1, 5, 3] and Offer Player 2: [1, 1, 1, 4, 1]\n\n  **New Calculation**:\n  - 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 84 = 252\n  - 0 units of item 2: 0 \u00d7 87 = 0\n  - 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 33 = 33\n  - 5 units of item 4: 5 \u00d7 60 = 300\n  - 3 units of item 5: 3 \u00d7 60 = 180\n  - **Total Value** = 252 + 0 + 33 + 300 + 180 = 765\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nThe new counteroffer provides a value of 765, which is greater than my outside offer of 675. This makes it consistent with my strategy to avoid Mistake 2 (making an offer worse than my outside offer).\n\nTherefore, my initial offer will be:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 4, 1]}\n```\n\nThis offer aims to balance maintaining a higher value for myself while also considering the possibility of acceptance by Player 2.",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items.

In the first round, it does not affect the value, but starting in the second round (like now), the values are multiplied by 0.98 to the power of (r-1), where r is the round number. So, for the current round 2, the values are slightly discounted by 0.98.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer Values:** [1, 0, 0, 0, 2] offered to me\n  - 1 unit of item 1: 1 \u00d7 48 = 48\n  - 0 units of item 2: 0 \u00d7 10 = 0\n  - 0 units of item 3: 0 \u00d7 52 = 0\n  - 0 units of item 4: 0 \u00d7 41 = 0\n  - 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 25 = 50\n  - Total value = 48 + 50 = 98\n  - Discounted value for round 2 = 98 \u00d7 0.98 = 96.04\n\n- **Comparison to Outside Offer:** \n  - The current offer gives me a discounted value of 96.04, significantly less than my outside offer value of 590.\n\n- **Potential Counteroffers:**\n  Let's consider a counteroffer that maximizes my value while being more attractive than walking away:\n  - If I take all of items 1, 3, and 4 but offer more of item 2 and 5:\n    - Keep for myself: [4, 1, 5, 5, 1]\n    - Offer to Player 2: [0, 2, 0, 0, 2], which gives me a value:\n      - My value = 4 \u00d7 48 + 1 \u00d7 10 + 5 \u00d7 52 + 5 \u00d7 41 + 1 \u00d7 25 = 762\n      - Discounted value for round 2 = 762 \u00d7 0.98 = 746.76\n  - This option maximizes my value and exceeds my outside offer significantly.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision Based on the Analysis\n\n- **Should I Accept?**\n  - No. The current offer is significantly worse than my outside offer, both before and after discounting.\n\n- **Should I Walk Away?**\n  - Not yet.

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 1053. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1053. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1071 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 4, 1, 0, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    82 x 4 + 41 x 4 + 71 x 1 + 66 x 0 + 97 x 5\n    which is 1048 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1053. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

Since no offers have been made, the discount factor does not yet apply.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - There is currently no offer on the table from Player 2 to consider accepting.\n   - I need to determine potential counteroffers. I will consider several allocations where my value exceeds my outside offer value of 1053.\n\n3) Decision making:\n   - Since there is no offer to ACCEPT, and WALK would yield my outside offer value of 1053, any counteroffer I propose must yield a value higher than 1053 for it to be considered.\n   - I will aim to keep items that maximize my total value while ensuring that the offer is better than my outside offer.\n\nTo ensure the counteroffer is more favorable than the outside offer, I will propose the following counteroffer: \n\nKeep:\n- 4 units of Item 1 (4 * 82 = 328)\n- 4 units of Item 2 (4 * 41 = 164)\n- 0 units of Item 3 (0 * 71 = 0)\n- 1 unit of Item 4 (1 * 66 = 66)\n- 4 units of Item 5 (4 * 97 = 388)\n\nOffer to Player 2:\n- 0 units of Item 1\n- 0 units of Item 2\n- 1 unit of Item 3\n- 0 units of Item 4\n- 1 unit of Item 5\n\nCalculating the total value of what I keep:\nTotal value = 328 + 164 + 0 + 66 + 388 = 946\n\nHowever, this total is less than 1053, which is not better than my outside offer, meaning I must retain more valuable items if the negotiation is to proceed.\n\nLet's adjust this:\n\nKeep:\n- 4 units of Item 1 (4 * 82 = 328)\n- 4 units of Item 2 (4 * 41 = 164)\n- 1 units of Item 3 (1 * 71 = 71)\n- 1 units of Item 4 (1 * 66 = 66)\n- 4 units of Item 5 (4 * 97 = 388)\n\nOffer to Player 2:\n- 0 units of Item 1\n- 0 units of Item 2\n- 0 units of Item 3\n- 0 units of Item 4\n- 1 unit of Item 5\n\nCalculating the total value of what I keep:\nTotal value = 328 + 164 + 71 + 66 + 388 = 1017\n\nAgain, my value (1017) is still less than my outside offer (1053). \n\nAdjusting again:\n\nKeep:\n- 4 units of Item 1 (4 * 82 = 328)\n- 4 units of Item 2 (4 * 41 = 164)\n- 1 units of Item 3 (1 * 71 = 71)\n- 1 units of Item 4 (1 * 66 = 66)\n- 5 units of Item 5 (5 * 97 = 485)\n\nOffer to Player 2:\n- 0 units of Item 1\n- 0 units of Item 2\n- 0 units of Item 3\n- 0 units of Item 4\n- 0 units of Item 5\n\nCalculating the total value of what I keep:\nTotal value = 328 + 164 + 71 + 66 + 485 = 1114\n\nThis meets or exceeds the outside offer. However, since negotiating in good faith suggests offering something, ensure the trade offers balance and potential externalities.

Here are some possible configurations:\n\n  Let's propose:\n  - Keeping 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 4 units of item 5 for myself, and offering 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, and 1 unit of item 5 to Player 1.\n\n  Calculation:\n  - Value of 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 25 = 75\n  - Value of 3 units of item 2: 3 \u00d7 27 = 81\n  - Value of 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 54 = 54\n  - Value of 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 53 = 53\n  - Value of 4 units of item 5: 4 \u00d7 35 = 140\n\n  \\[\n  \\text{Total value} = 75 + 81 + 54 + 53 + 140 = 403\n  \\]\n\n  This is greater than my outside offer of 279.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision Based on the Analysis:\n\n- **Should I accept the current offer?** No, since it gives me a value of 27, which is much lower than my outside offer of 279.\n\n- **Should I walk away?** Not yet necessary, as I have the opportunity to propose a counteroffer that can yield more than my outside offer.\n\n- **Propose a Counteroffer:** I will propose a counteroffer where I keep 3 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 4 of item 5, giving Player 1: [1, 1, 0, 0, 1].\n\nTherefore, my action is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1053. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1071 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 4, 1, 0, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    82 x 4 + 41 x 4 + 71 x 1 + 66 x 0 + 97 x 5\n    which is 1048 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1053. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

If I accept the current offer in round 2, the effective value will be multiplied by 0.98^(2-1) = 0.98.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer value if I accept:**\n     - 1 unit of item 1: 1 \u00d7 82 = 82\n     - 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 41 = 41\n     - 0 unit of item 3: 0 \u00d7 71 = 0\n     - 0 unit of item 4: 0 \u00d7 66 = 0\n     - 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 97 = 97\n     - Total value = 82 + 41 + 0 + 0 + 97 = 220\n     - After discount: 220 \u00d7 0.98 = 215.6\n\n   - **Comparison to outside offer:**\n     - 215.6 (current offer value after discount) < 1053 (outside offer value), so the current offer is significantly worse than walking away.\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:**\n     - I need to find a distribution that gives me more than 1053 in value. Let's evaluate some potential counteroffers starting from keeping most of the high-value items:\n\n     - **Example Offer: [0, 0, 1, 1, 0] (keeping all except these):**\n       - 4 unit of item 1: 4 \u00d7 82 = 328\n       - 4 unit of item 2: 4 \u00d7 41 = 164\n       - 0 unit of item 3: 0 \u00d7 71 = 0\n       - 0 unit of item 4: 0 \u00d7 66 = 0\n       - 5 unit of item 5: 5 \u00d7 97 = 485\n       - Total value = 328 + 164 + 0 + 0 + 485 = 977\n\n     - This offer would still be less than my outside offer of 1053, so I need to adjust it further.\n\n   - **Re-evaluation with Offer: [0, 0, 0, 1, 0] (keeping all except items 3 and 4):**\n       - Value of keeping 4 unit of item 1 = 4 * 82 = 328\n       - Value of keeping 4 unit of item 2 = 4 * 41 = 164\n       - Value of keeping 1 unit of item 3 = 1 * 71 = 71\n       - Value of keeping 0 unit of item 4 = 0 * 66 = 0\n       - Value of keeping 5 unit of item 5 = 5 * 97 = 485\n       - Total value of keeping these items = 328 + 164 + 71 + 0 + 485 = 1048\n       \n   - **Comparison:**\n       - 1048 is still less than 1053, so this offer won't work. \n\n   - **Re-evaluation with Offer: [0, 0, 1, 0, 1]:**\n       - Value of keeping 4 unit of item 1 = 4 * 82 = 328\n       - Value of keeping 4 unit of item 2 = 4 * 41 = 164\n       - Value of keeping 0 unit of item 3 = 0 * 71 = 0\n       - Value of keeping 1 unit of item 4 = 1 * 66 = 66\n       - Value of keeping 4 unit of item 5 = 4 * 97 = 388\n       - Total value of keeping = 328 + 164 + 0 + 66 + 388 = 946\n\n     - **Re-evaluation with Offer: [3, 3, 1, 0, 5]:**\n       - Value of keeping 1 unit of item 1 = 1 * 82 = 82\n       - Value of keeping 1 unit of item 2 = 1 * 41 = 41\n       - Value of keeping 0 unit of item 3 = 0 * 71 = 0\n       - Value of keeping 1 unit of item 4 = 1 * 66 = 66\n       - Value of keeping 0 unit of item 5 = 0 * 97 = 0\n       - Total value of keeping = 82 + 41 + 0 + 66 + 0 = 189\n\n     This proposal seems again less, even without need of calculating since closer values do not work.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n   - Since the current offer is less beneficial than my outside offer and any immediate obvious counteroffer is less beneficial, and given the discount rate worsens any delayed acceptable offer's value, I am most likely best to walk away.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Offer B yields a higher value than Offer A, making it the preferred counteroffer.\n\nThus, I will proceed with proposing Offer B. Here is my action:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 3, 2, 1]}\n```",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 634. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 634. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 831 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 1, 6, 4, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    53 x 3 + 93 x 1 + 33 x 6 + 27 x 4 + 71 x 1\n    which is 629 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 634. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 3, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 3, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [6, 1, 4, 0, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    1 x 6 + 33 x 1 + 60 x 4 + 32 x 0 + 55 x 3\n    which is 444 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 448. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 1, 1, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 1, 1, 3]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "To determine the best action, I will follow the step-by-step process outlined:\n\n1) Analyze the Current Situation:\n   - My outside offer value: 448\n   - My values for the items are:\n     - Item 1: 1\n     - Item 2: 33\n     - Item 3: 60\n     - Item 4: 32\n     - Item 5: 55\n   - Total pool of items: [6, 1, 4, 1, 4]\n   - Discount factor: Each round reduces the value by gamma = 0.98. Since it's round 1 and no earlier discounts apply, we focus on the intrinsic values of the offers first.\n\n2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n   - Current Offer on the Table: [2, 1, 1, 1, 3] (items being offered to me)\n      - Value to me if I accept:\n        - 2 units of item 1 = 2 x 1 = 2\n        - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 x 33 = 33\n        - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 x 60 = 60\n        - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 x 32 = 32\n        - 3 units of item 5 = 3 x 55 = 165\n      - Total value = 2 + 33 + 60 + 32 + 165 = 292\n\n   - The total value of the current offer (292) is less than my outside offer value (448).\n\n3) Make a Decision Based on Analysis:\n   - Since the current offer value (292) is less than my outside offer (448), I should not accept the current offer.\n   - Walking away is also not optimal immediately since negotiations have only just begun, and there might be better offers.\n   \n   - Propose a counteroffer:\n     To make a valid counteroffer, I need a division where my value is at least above my outside offer of 448.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 7, 1, 2, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    4 x 2 + 52 x 7 + 43 x 1 + 35 x 2 + 78 x 5\n    which is 875 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 876. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 4, 0, 0, 5]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 4, 0, 0, 5]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Let's evaluate the current situation step by step.\n\n### 1) Analyze the Current Situation:\n- **Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer is 876.\n- **Values of the Items**: \n  - Item 1 = 4\n  - Item 2 = 52\n  - Item 3 = 43\n  - Item 4 = 35\n  - Item 5 = 78\n- **Total Pool of Items**: \n  - 3 units of item 1\n  - 7 units of item 2\n  - 1 unit of item 3\n  - 2 units of item 4\n  - 5 units of item 5\n- **Discount Factor**: The discount factor (\u03b3) of 0.98 affects the valuation of outcomes in later rounds. However, in round 1, there's no discount to consider for the value.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n- **Current Offer**: [3, 4, 0, 0, 5] (Offered to me)\n  - Value of Item 1: 3 \u00d7 4 = 12\n  - Value of Item 2: 4 \u00d7 52 = 208\n  - Value of Item 3: 0 \u00d7 43 = 0\n  - Value of Item 4: 0 \u00d7 35 = 0\n  - Value of Item 5: 5 \u00d7 78 = 390\n  - **Total Value**: 12 + 208 + 0 + 0 + 390 = 610\n\nSince 610 is less than my outside offer of 876, accepting the current offer isn't a satisfactory option. \n\n### 3) Make a Decision:\n- **Current Offer Evaluation**: 610 is less than my outside offer value (876), so accepting is not a good choice.\n- **Evaluate Walk**: Walking away gives me a value of 876, which is better than accepting the current offer.\n- **Craft a Counteroffer** to avoid the mistakes:\n  - My essential goal is to propose a counteroffer that provides me more than my outside offer.\n  - Let's calculate a possible counteroffer where my value is above 876:\n    - Target: Keep most of items where my value is high and offer something compelling to Player 1.\n    - I need to calculate a division that gives me a value of more than 876. For example:\n      - If I propose giving Player 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (which gives me full allocation). \n    - Total Value for keeping all:\n      - 3 \u00d7 4 + 7 \u00d7 52 + 1 \u00d7 43 + 2 \u00d7 35 + 5 \u00d7 78 = 12 + 364 + 43 + 70 + 390 = 879\n\nThis brings my value slightly above my outside offer of 876.\n\nConsidering the current offer is less than my outside offer and how valuably the items add up when kept fully or partially, I'll opt for walking away because both accepting the current offer and proposing a speculative counteroffer are less or marginally beneficial than my outside offer.\n\n### Final Decision:\n\nTherefore, the action taken will be to walk away as I choose to take the outside offer, which guarantees a higher value relative to the negotiation currently presented.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

It is best to ensure that any accepted offer now is better than my outside offer and accounts for any potential discount if delayed acceptance is considered.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n   - **Current Offer:** [4, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n     - Value to me if accepted: 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 41 = 164\n     - Since 164 is less than my outside offer of 531, accepting the current offer is not beneficial.\n   - **Potential Counteroffers:**\n     - I need to calculate a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 531 to ensure it is better than my outside offer.\n     - My current retention if I propose [3, 4, 5, 3, 1]:\n       - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123\n       - 4 units of item 2 = 4 \u00d7 86 = 344\n       - 5 units of item 3 = 5 \u00d7 10 = 50\n       - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129\n       - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 28 = 28\n       - Total value = 674\n     - This total value of 674 exceeds my outside offer of 531.\n\n3) **Make a Decision Based on the Analysis:**\n   - Accepting the current offer is not beneficial.\n   - Walking away is suboptimal because better divisions of items could still provide a higher value for me.\n   - Proposing a counteroffer: Offering a combination that retains more value than the outside offer makes negotiation worth continuing.\n\nTherefore, my action is to propose a specific counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 4, 5, 3, 1]}",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 145. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 145. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 315 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 3, 3, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    27 x 0 + 11 x 0 + 20 x 3 + 28 x 3 + 19 x 0\n    which is 144 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 145. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [4, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 4, 5, 3, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 4, 5, 3, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

I keep more of higher value items without exceeding my outside offer value.\n\n**Counteroffer Calculation:**\n\n   I need to retain items worth more than 145.

Since Player 1's last two offers give them items like [4, 0, 0, 0, 0] and [4, 4, 3, 0, 0], they likely value items 1, 2, and 3 highly.\n\nI need to structure a counteroffer that keeps my portion's value high, preferably more than my outside offer (531 / 0.98 = 541.84). \n\nLet's try proposing to give Player 1 a bit more of items 1 and 3, which they've shown interest in, and keep a high value on my side:\n\nLet's propose: [4, 3, 3, 2, 1] to Player 1.\n\n- My units: [3, 1, 2, 1, 0]\n  - Calculation:\n    - Item 1: 3 \u00d7 41 = 123\n    - Item 2: 1 \u00d7 86 = 86\n    - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 10 = 20\n    - Item 4: 1 \u00d7 43 = 43\n    - Item 5: 0 \u00d7 28 = 0\n  \n  Total value: 123 + 86 + 20 + 43 + 0 = 272\n\nAfter calculating, it turns out that offering items like above would only give me a total of 272, which is far below my outside offer value even with discount consideration.\n\nLet's reverse the items to have [3, 0, 2, 3, 1]:\n\nMy units now:\n- [4, 4, 3, 0, 0] for Player 1\n- [3, 0, 2, 3, 1] for me gives:\n  - Item 1: 3 x 41 = 123\n  - Item 2: 0 x 86 = 0\n  - Item 3: 2 x 10 = 20\n  - Item 4: 3 x 43 = 129\n  - Item 5: 1 x 28 = 28\n\nDiscounted Total Value = (123 + 0 + 20 + 129 + 28) * 0.98 = 286.64, still low.\n\nSo, I need to formulate a better division that would leverage better distribution. Considering my outside value and trying to weigh now against the over about [3, 0, 2, 3, 1] gave only less, let's aim to retain more of the lesser units and improve overall.\n\nFinally, let's create structural advantages by maximizing key offerings:\n\n**Counteroffer**: [4, 2, 2, 0, 0]\n\nMy units now:\n- [3, 2, 3, 3, 1] for me:\n  - Item 1: 3 x 41 = 123\n  - Item 2: 2 x 86 = 172\n  - Item 3: 3 x 10 = 30\n  - Item 4: 3 x 43 = 129\n  - Item 5: 1 x 28 = 28\n\nTotal Value now:\n123 + 172 + 30 + 129 + 28 = 482\n\nAfter accounting for imperfect rounds: 482 * 0.98 = 472.36, still tuned down.\n\nFinally, given the mentioned values, it would iterate for streamlined options that don't detriment over the outside range, which gives value resorting options even if mildly every finally but let's refine for resource allocation attributes now, [3, 1, 2, 3, 1].\n\nTherefore, based on being reflective (calculated error-statements unacceptable), the negotiation concludes round; reach overlap offers internally handle norms:\n\nUltimately, after rs into considerations along tab: adjustments disfavors adaptability -- the persevering [3, 0, 2, 3, 1] error-prone still risks converges striving: beneficial levels \u2013 retain offers step improve marginal with statute tighter settings.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 10. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 681 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    58 x 0 + 59 x 0 + 9 x 1 + 34 x 0 + 67 x 0\n    which is 9 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 10. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Therefore, reaching a deal earlier is typically better value-wise.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\nSince there's no current offer from Player 2 yet, I will focus on crafting an initial offer that maximizes my value while being strategically reasonable.\n\n#### Initial Offer Consideration\n\nTo avoid making an initial offer that's worse than my outside offer, I need to ensure that the value of items I keep is greater than 307:\n\nLet's propose a division strategy where I keep a majority of high-value items:\n\n1. **Keep:**\n   - 3 units of Item 1 = 3 x 23 = 69\n   - 3 units of Item 2 = 3 x 61 = 183\n   - 2 units of Item 3 = 2 x 80 = 160\n   - 0 units of Item 4 = 0 x 5 = 0\n   - 4 units of Item 5 = 4 x 85 = 340\n   - **Total Value Kept = 69 + 183 + 160 + 0 + 340 = 752**\n\n2. **Offer to Player 2:**\n   - 1 unit of Item 1\n   - 2 units of Item 2\n   - 0 units of Item 3\n   - 2 unit of Item 4\n   - 1 unit of Item 5\n\nThe offer I make has to ensure the value of the items I keep is at least equal to or higher than my outside offer of 307.

                    "response": "To address this negotiation scenario, let's perform a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - **Outside offer value:** Your outside offer value is 269.\n   - **Values of the items involved (your values per unit):** \n     - Item 1: 30\n     - Item 2: 42\n     - Item 3: 32\n     - Item 4: 73\n     - Item 5: 43\n   - **Total pool of items:**\n     - 4 units of item 1\n     - 5 units of item 2\n     - 2 units of item 3\n     - 2 units of item 4\n     - 5 units of item 5\n   - **Discount factor influence:** The discount factor is 0.98. The negotiation value is multiplied by this factor as rounds progress, but this is the first round, so the discount doesn't apply yet.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer ([1, 2, 0, 2, 1]):** Calculate the value of the offer to you.\n     - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 30 = 30\n     - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 42 = 84\n     - 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 32 = 0\n     - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 73 = 146\n     - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 43 = 43\n     - **Total value of the current offer = 30 + 84 + 0 + 146 + 43 = 303**\n   - Compare the total value of the current offer (303) to your outside offer value (269). The current offer is better than your outside offer.\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** It's crucial to check potential counteroffers against the outside offer value and avoid any of the five mistakes outlined.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n   - **Should I accept the current offer?**\n     - Yes. Accepting offers a value of 303, which is higher than your outside offer of 269.\n   - **Should I walk away and take my outside offer?**\n     - No. Walking away would yield 269, which is less favorable than the current offer.\n   - **Should I propose a specific counteroffer?**\n     - No, proposing a counteroffer isn't necessary here because the current offer is already better than your outside option.\n\nBased on the analysis above, the optimal action is to accept the current offer. \n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 661. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 661. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 420 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 6, 6, 5, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    30 x 4 + 23 x 6 + 38 x 6 + 11 x 5 + 38 x 3\n    which is 655 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 661. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

I want an offer where the value I retain is greater than my outside offer of 661.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - I must calculate a division of items where my retained value exceeds 661.\n\nLet me try a potential division:\nLet's assume I propose to grant Player 2:\n- 1 unit of Item 1\n- 1 unit of Item 2\n- 1 unit of Item 3\n- 2 units of Item 4\n- 1 unit of Item 5\n\nGiven this, I keep:\n- 4 units of Item 1\n- 5 units of Item 2\n- 5 units of Item 3\n- 3 units of Item 4\n- 2 units of Item 5\n\nMy value calculation for keeping these units:\n- Item 1: 4 x 30 = 120\n- Item 2: 5 x 23 = 115\n- Item 3: 5 x 38 = 190\n- Item 4: 3 x 11 = 33\n- Item 5: 2 x 38 = 76\n\nMy total value for these retained items is 534, which is below my outside offer of 661.

Let's iterate further on valuing more options that exceed 661. \n\nGiven all these conditions and calculations, my optimal action is to ensure I submit a counterproposal that will leave me with more retained value, let's slightly offer optimal alternatives based on calculations and valuable negotiation:\n\n**Counteroffer:**\n- Let me offer: \n- 0 units of Item 1\n- 0 units of Item 2\n- 2 units of Item 3\n- 0 units of Item 4\n- 0 units of Item 5\n\nFor myself:\n- Item 1: 5 x 30 = 150\n- Item 2: 6 x 23 = 138\n- Item 3: 4 x 38 = 152\n- Item 4: 5 x 11 = 55\n- Item 5: 3 x 38 = 114\n\nEnsuring that I meet a threshold where I can easily revise based on necessary decisions again due to lower outcomes.\n\nCounteroffer final calculations easily verified before next round.\n\nMy action proposed as Counteroffer is also reassessed once more.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 2, 0, 0]}\n```\n\nNow, ascertain improvements before the next offer is evaluated upon player decisions later.",

My task is to propose a counteroffer over the outside value of 1138. \n  \nLet's try:\n- **Keep 0 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5:**\n  - 0 units of item 1 = 0\n  - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225\n  - 6 units of item 3 = 6 \u00d7 60 = 360\n  - 5 units of item 4 = 5 \u00d7 19 = 95\n  - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 74 = 222\n  - **Total Value:** 902\n  \nUpon multiple trials and checks, finding a reasonable strategy for the maximum beneficial offer indeed seems challenging. Since my direct outside value is higher than covered potential values and re-calculation suggests careful next step negotiation with possible extra units to me, I'm choosing to secure my maximum outer guarantee.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nGiven that the current offer and potential counteroffers do not exceed my outside value of 1138, I should walk away in this scenario:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 938. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 750 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 5, 5, 2, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    96 x 3 + 72 x 5 + 48 x 5 + 14 x 2 + 20 x 1\n    which is 936 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 938. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To decide on my action, I need to go through the step-by-step analysis outlined above:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 938.\n   - The values of the items to me are:\n     - Item 1: 96\n     - Item 2: 72\n     - Item 3: 48\n     - Item 4: 14\n     - Item 5: 20\n   - The total pool of items is:\n     - 3 units of item 1\n     - 5 units of item 2\n     - 5 units of item 3\n     - 3 units of item 4\n     - 3 units of item 5\n   - The discount factor influences the negotiation value over successive rounds. At round 1, it is less of a concern unless we are considering delaying to rounds 2 or 3.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer: There is no current offer to me.\n   - Potential counteroffers: I need to determine a counteroffer that gives me a value higher than my outside offer value of 938.\n\n   Let's consider the possible counteroffer where I propose keeping certain items:\n\n   - I will aim to make a counteroffer that ensures my value remains above 938. To do this, I need to optimize the value based on the values given to me.\n\n**Example Counteroffer:** Suppose I keep 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 3, and 3 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5, and offer the rest to Player 2.\n   - Value to me:\n     - Item 1: 3 units \u00d7 96 = 288\n     - Item 2: 0 units \u00d7 72 = 0\n     - Item 3: 3 units \u00d7 48 = 144\n     - Item 4: 3 units \u00d7 14 = 42\n     - Item 5: 2 units \u00d7 20 = 40\n   - Total value: 288 + 0 + 144 + 42 + 40 = 514\n\n   This value (514) is too low compared to my outside offer. Let's adjust.\n\nAlternately, let's maximize the high-value items:\n\n   - Suppose I keep 3 of item 1, 5 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 0 of item 4, and 0 of item 5:\n     - Item 1: 3 units \u00d7 96 = 288\n     - Item 2: 5 units \u00d7 72 = 360\n     - Item 3: 3 units \u00d7 48 = 144\n     - Total value: 288 + 360 + 144 = 792\n\nThis total is still less than my outside offer. Adjusting again:\n\nIf I keep only 2 of item 2 (a high-value item for me), let's recalculate:\n\n   - Suppose I keep 3 of item 1, 2 of item 2, and 5 of item 3:\n     - Item 1: 3 units \u00d7 96 = 288\n     - Item 2: 2 units \u00d7 72 = 144\n     - Item 3: 5 units \u00d7 48 = 240\n     - Total value: 288 + 144 + 240 = 672\n\nThis value is still not optimal. Let\u2019s reassess.\n\nIf I retain complete ownership of the items with the highest value:\n\n   - Assume I keep 3 of item 1, 5 of item 2, 5 of item 3: \n     - Item 1: 3 units \u00d7 96 = 288\n     - Item 2: 5 units \u00d7 72 = 360\n     - Item 3: 5 units \u00d7 48 = 240\n     - Total value: 288 + 360 + 240 = 888\n\nAlthough this is close, it doesn\u2019t surpass my outside offer. Therefore, it may be wise to optimize further in final calculations or pursue negotiations. For now, given priorities:\n\nIt\u2019s prudent to confirm if holding all items (where I value highly) rewards higher than re-offering:\n\n   **3)** My Decision:\n\n      - Currently considering a counteroffer requires calculation clarity. [n1, n2, n3, n4, n5] (where n1 items are provided to Player 2):\n      - Considering my external offer, I propose keeping all items initially as calculations strive close values - this forms a baseline.\n\n      ```json\n      {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 3, 3]}\n      ```\n\nThis offers me the power to adjust depending on actionable responses.
