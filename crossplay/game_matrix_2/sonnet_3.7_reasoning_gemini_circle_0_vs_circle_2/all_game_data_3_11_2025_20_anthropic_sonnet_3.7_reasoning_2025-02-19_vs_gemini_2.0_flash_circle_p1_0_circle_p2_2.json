This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Therefore, I should either walk away or make a counteroffer. Let's consider making a counteroffer. The goal is to obtain a value greater than 453.\n\nI have:\n- 2 units of item 1\n- 7 units of item 2\n- 3 units of item 3\n- 2 units of item 4\n- 0 units of item 5\n\nTo create a counteroffer, I need to decide what to offer Player 1. Let's aim for a split that is beneficial to me.\nSince it is round 1, I don't want to concede too much in my first offer, so I will offer slightly more than half of my items. I will also slightly favor giving away items that I value less to keep more items I value more.\n\nLet's try the following counteroffer: [1, 3, 1, 1, 0]\nThis means I give Player 1:\n- 1 unit of item 1\n- 3 units of item 2\n- 1 unit of item 3\n- 1 unit of item 4\n- 0 unit of item 5\n\nWhich means I would receive:\n- 1 unit of item 1\n- 4 units of item 2\n- 2 unit of item 3\n- 1 unit of item 4\n- 0 unit of item 5\n\nThe value of this to me would be:\n(1 * 62) + (4 * 50) + (2 * 36) + (1 * 8) + (0 * 23) = 62 + 200 + 72 + 8 + 0 = 342\n\nThis is still less than my outside offer, so I need to make a better counteroffer. Let's try a slightly more aggressive offer to Player 1. I will give Player 1 a little more of the items I value less, and a little less of the items I value more.\n\nCounteroffer: [1, 4, 2, 1, 0]\n\nI give Player 1:\n- 1 unit of item 1\n- 4 units of item 2\n- 2 unit of item 3\n- 1 unit of item 4\n- 0 unit of item 5\n\nWhich means I would receive:\n- 1 unit of item 1\n- 3 units of item 2\n- 1 unit of item 3\n- 1 unit of item 4\n- 0 unit of item 5\n\nThe value of this to me would be:\n(1 * 62) + (3 * 50) + (1 * 36) + (1 * 8) + (0 * 23) = 62 + 150 + 36 + 8 + 0 = 256\n\nSince 256 < 453, this is not a good offer for me.

Since this is the second round, and if I offer now, I have to assume Player 1 may or may not accept my counteroffer in round 3, or they may WALK.\n\nI need an offer that is better than my walkaway of 449.\nLet's try to keep as much as I can. Since Player 1 offered [0, 0, 1, 2, 0], they want at least that much. I could offer them exactly that amount, so my counteroffer would be [0, 0, 1, 2, 0]. In this case, my value would be 708 - 144 = 564. The discounted value would be 564 * 0.98 = 552.72 which is much greater than my outside offer.\n\nHowever, to get Player 1 to accept, I will need to offer them slightly more than what they offered me.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 404. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player1, 2 units of each item (keeping 2 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1119 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

However, I need to consider if there's room to negotiate for a better offer.\n\nIf I accept, my value is 540. If I walk, my value is 404.\n\nTo determine if a counteroffer is better, I need to consider what Player 1 might accept. A reasonable counteroffer would be one where I take slightly more of the items I value highly and give Player 1 more of the items I value less.\nSince I am in round 1, I have some bargaining power. I want to make a counteroffer that gives me more while still being acceptable to Player 1, I don't know Player 1's values, so I will try to offer a deal that is a bit more in my favor than the current one. The current offer values me at 540.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 979. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player1, 2 units of each item (keeping 2 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 669 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 2, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 2, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the current offer and determine the best course of action.\n\nThe current offer on the table is [0, 1, 2, 1, 1], meaning I receive:\n- 0 units of item 1\n- 1 unit of item 2\n- 2 units of item 3\n- 1 unit of item 4\n- 1 unit of item 5\n\nMy values per unit are:\n- Item 1: 45\n- Item 2: 62\n- Item 3: 49\n- Item 4: 43\n- Item 5: 24\n\nThe value of this offer to me is:\n(0 * 45) + (1 * 62) + (2 * 49) + (1 * 43) + (1 * 24) = 0 + 62 + 98 + 43 + 24 = 227\n\nSince my outside offer is 979, accepting this offer (227) is significantly worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. My goal is to maximize my value, taking into account the discount factor in later rounds.  I need to figure out what Player 1's values are likely to be to make a reasonable counteroffer. Since their values are drawn from the same distribution as mine (1-101), a reasonable initial strategy is to aim for an even split, or slightly in my favor. I want to secure a deal that is better than my outside offer, discounted by the probability of the negotiation failing, and the round it is in.\n\nI have:\n- 4 units of item 1\n- 6 units of item 2\n- 3 units of item 3\n- 4 units of item 4\n- 5 units of item 5\n\nLet's try an offer where I give Player 1 close to half of each item (rounding where necessary to avoid fractions), and keeping the rest for myself. I will offer them:\n- 2 units of item 1\n- 3 units of item 2\n- 1 unit of item 3\n- 2 units of item 4\n- 2 units of item 5\n\nThis would leave me with:\n- 2 units of item 1\n- 3 units of item 2\n- 2 units of item 3\n- 2 units of item 4\n- 3 units of item 5\n\nThe value of this to me is:\n(2 * 45) + (3 * 62) + (2 * 49) + (2 * 43) + (3 * 24) = 90 + 186 + 98 + 86 + 72 = 532\n\nThis is still far below my outside offer, so I'll try offering Player 1 a bit less, keeping more for myself. Let me try offering Player 1:\n- 1 unit of item 1\n- 2 unit of item 2\n- 0 unit of item 3\n- 1 unit of item 4\n- 1 unit of item 5\n\nThat means I will have:\n- 3 unit of item 1\n- 4 unit of item 2\n- 3 unit of item 3\n- 3 unit of item 4\n- 4 unit of item 5\n\nThe value for me is:\n(3 * 45) + (4 * 62) + (3 * 49) + (3 * 43) + (4 * 24) = 135 + 248 + 147 + 129 + 96 = 755\n\nStill below my outside offer, let's try to be a bit more greedy, offering:\n- 0 unit of item 1\n- 1 unit of item 2\n- 0 unit of item 3\n- 0 unit of item 4\n- 0 unit of item 5\n\nLeaving me with:\n- 4 unit of item 1\n- 5 unit of item 2\n- 3 unit of item 3\n- 4 unit of item 4\n- 5 unit of item 5\n\nThe value for me is:\n(4 * 45) + (5 * 62) + (3 * 49) + (4 * 43) + (5 * 24) = 180 + 310 + 147 + 172 + 120 = 929\n\nStill less than my outside offer. Let's go even more greedy! Offer:\n- 0 units of item 1\n- 0 units of item 2\n- 0 units of item 3\n- 0 units of item 4\n- 0 units of item 5\n\nThis leaves me with everything, meaning a value of 991. This is higher than my outside offer of 979.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n",

This means they want me to have 1 unit of item 3, and they're keeping the rest. My private values are 45, 62, 49, 43, 24 for items 1 through 5 respectively. My outside offer is 979. The discount factor is 0.98.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of Player 1's current offer to me:\n\n1 unit of item 3 = 1 * 49 = 49\n\nNow, let's consider the implications of accepting, walking away, or making a counteroffer.\n\n*   **ACCEPT:** My value would be 49. Applying the discount factor of 0.98, the present value would be 49 * 0.98 = 48.02. This is significantly less than my outside offer of 979.\n*   **WALK:** My value would be my outside offer of 979.\n*   **COUNTEROFFER:** I need to propose an offer that gives Player 1 enough to be better than walking away, while still giving me more than my outside offer after the discount. Given this is round 2, I will make a counteroffer that favors me heavily, with the goal of at least matching my outside offer if it is accepted. I have the following resources: 4 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 5 units of item 5.\n\nLet's aim to secure most of the items for myself while giving Player 1 a minimal amount so it might be accepted.\n\nHere's my proposed counteroffer: Offer Player 1 [3, 5, 2, 3, 4]. That leaves me with 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\nThe value to me would be:\n1 * 45 + 1 * 62 + 1 * 49 + 1 * 43 + 1 * 24 = 223\n\nApply discount to find the present value:\n223 * 0.98 = 218.54. This is still less than my outside offer, so I should walk.\n\nLet's make another, more extreme counteroffer to demonstrate how this affects my value. I propose to give Player 1 only the unit of Item 3 that they are already offering me, and nothing else.\n\nSo I would make the counteroffer of [0, 0, 1, 0, 0].\n\nIn this case, my value would be calculated as:\n4 * 45 + 6 * 62 + 2 * 49 + 4 * 43 + 5 * 24\n= 180 + 372 + 98 + 172 + 120\n= 942\n\nApply discount to find the present value:\n942 * 0.98 = 923.16. This is less than my outside offer, so I will walk away.\n\nSince none of the counteroffers improve my value beyond my outside offer, it is best to walk away and guarantee receiving 979.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1108. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player1, 2 units of each item (keeping 2 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 774 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [6, 0, 0, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [6, 0, 0, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the offer and determine the best course of action.\n\nThe current offer on the table is [6, 0, 0, 1, 1]. This means Player 1 is offering me:\n* 6 units of item 1\n* 0 units of item 2\n* 0 units of item 3\n* 1 unit of item 4\n* 1 unit of item 5\n\nMy private values are:\n* Item 1: 79\n* Item 2: 44\n* Item 3: 24\n* Item 4: 52\n* Item 5: 59\n\nTherefore, the value of the current offer to me is:\n(6 * 79) + (0 * 44) + (0 * 24) + (1 * 52) + (1 * 59) = 474 + 0 + 0 + 52 + 59 = 585\n\nSince it is round 1, the discount factor is 0.98^(1-1) = 1. Therefore the present value of the offer is 585 * 1 = 585.\n\nMy outside offer is worth 1108.\n\nSince 585 < 1108, accepting the offer would be worse than walking away. So, I should make a counteroffer.\n\nNow, let's think about a good counteroffer. I have the following amounts of each item:\n* Item 1: 7\n* Item 2: 0\n* Item 3: 1\n* Item 4: 4\n* Item 5: 6\n\nI will calculate the value of keeping all the items myself versus giving some away to Player 1 and see if there are beneficial trades.\n\nLet's start with a simple counteroffer: I offer Player 1 half of the items. Since item 2 has 0 units, and item 3 has 1 unit, I will offer 0 and 0 respectively. Also, round down the values of Item 1, 4, and 5 to make it valid.\n\nI will offer Player 1 [3, 0, 0, 2, 3]\n\nThis means I keep:\n* Item 1: 7 - 3 = 4\n* Item 2: 0 - 0 = 0\n* Item 3: 1 - 0 = 1\n* Item 4: 4 - 2 = 2\n* Item 5: 6 - 3 = 3\n\nValue of this to me:\n(4 * 79) + (0 * 44) + (1 * 24) + (2 * 52) + (3 * 59) = 316 + 0 + 24 + 104 + 177 = 621\n\nSince 621 < 1108, I will try to get more items to increase this value.\n\nI will offer Player 1 [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]. This means I keep:\n* Item 1: 7 - 1 = 6\n* Item 2: 0 - 0 = 0\n* Item 3: 1 - 0 = 1\n* Item 4: 4 - 0 = 4\n* Item 5: 6 - 1 = 5\n\nValue to me: (6*79)+(0*44)+(1*24)+(4*52)+(5*59) = 474 + 0 + 24 + 208 + 295 = 1001\n\nSince 1001 < 1108, I should walk.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the current offer and determine the best action for Player 2 (myself).\n\nThe current offer is [0, 3, 0, 3, 0].

Since the current offer (60) is significantly lower than my outside offer, I should not accept it.\n\nNow, I need to decide whether to walk away or make a counteroffer. Making a counteroffer gives me a chance to potentially reach a better deal, but it's also important to consider the discount factor in later rounds.\n\nLet's think about a possible counteroffer. My goal is to maximize my value, and I should try to get as much of the items I value highly as possible. Item 1 is my most valuable item, followed by Item 3. I should concede on items I value less, such as Item 2, Item 4 and Item 5.\n\nI'll start by making a counteroffer that gives Player 1 slightly more than half of each item to incentivize them to accept.\n\nCounteroffer: [1, 2, 2, 3, 2] (Giving Player 1 these amounts)\nThis means I would get:\nItem 1: 3 - 1 = 2\nItem 2: 3 - 2 = 1\nItem 3: 4 - 2 = 2\nItem 4: 5 - 3 = 2\nItem 5: 4 - 2 = 2\n\nValue of this counteroffer to me:\n2 * 81 + 1 * 2 + 2 * 43 + 2 * 18 + 2 * 16 = 162 + 2 + 86 + 36 + 32 = 318\n\nSince 318 < 434, this is not an optimal offer. I will aim to improve my utility with a new offer.\n\nCounteroffer: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (Giving Player 1 none of the items).\nThis means I get to keep everything. My value would be\n3 * 81 + 3 * 2 + 4 * 43 + 5 * 18 + 4 * 16 = 243 + 6 + 172 + 90 + 64 = 575\nSince 575 > 434, this would be a good outcome *if* player 1 accepted. But they likely won't.\n\nGiven the limited number of rounds, and to try to get a better deal than the outside offer, I will counter with an offer that gives Player 1 just enough to be better than nothing, and leaves the majority of the value to me. It is unlikely to work but still higher than the original value.\nCounteroffer: [0, 3, 0, 3, 0]\n\nThis would give them the same low utility, which is better to me to try and negotiate a deal.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 0, 3, 0]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action.\n\n**Current Offer Analysis:**\n\nThe current offer from Player 1 is [3, 4, 1, 1, 4]. This means I receive:\n\n*   Item 1: 3 units\n*   Item 2: 4 units\n*   Item 3: 1 unit\n*   Item 4: 1 unit\n*   Item 5: 4 units\n\nMy values for these items are:\n\n*   Item 1: 13\n*   Item 2: 63\n*   Item 3: 93\n*   Item 4: 73\n*   Item 5: 25\n\nTherefore, the value of this offer to me is:\n\n(3 * 13) + (4 * 63) + (1 * 93) + (1 * 73) + (4 * 25) = 39 + 252 + 93 + 73 + 100 = 557\n\n**Discount Factor:**\n\nSince it's round 2, the discount factor is 0.98^(2-1) = 0.98.\n\n**Present Value of Current Offer:**\n\nThe present value of the current offer is 557 * 0.98 = 545.86\n\n**Comparison with Outside Offer:**\n\nMy outside offer is worth 764. The present value of the current offer (545.86) is less than my outside offer. Therefore, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\n**Counteroffer Considerations:**\n\nI want to determine if a counteroffer could be beneficial. I need to leave Player 1 with enough items that they would prefer to accept my offer rather than walk away with their outside offer. We don't know player 1's values, so it's difficult to give an offer they will definitely accept. We only have one more round of negotiations. If I make a counteroffer now, I will walk if they reject it.\n\n**Trying a Counteroffer:**\nLet's consider offering Player 1 the minimum amount of each item. \nI currently have:\nItem 1: 6\nItem 2: 7\nItem 3: 4\nItem 4: 5\nItem 5: 6\nCurrent offer from player 1 gives me 3,4,1,1,4, so they have 3,3,3,4,2\nTo have more items myself, I need to offer less than they have now. Let's offer them 2 of each item.\n\nIf I give Player 1 [2,2,2,2,2], that means I keep 4,5,2,3,4. The value of these to me is:\n4 * 13 + 5 * 63 + 2 * 93 + 3 * 73 + 4 * 25 = 52 + 315 + 186 + 219 + 100 = 872\nThis gives a present value of 872 * 0.98 = 854.56, which is greater than my outside option of 764.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nSince my outside offer is 764, the current offer is worth 545.86, and I can create an offer that is worth 854.56, I will make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]}\n```",

I want to maximize my value, taking into account the risk of walking away if we don't reach an agreement.\n\nLet's think about a possible counteroffer.  I want to keep as much of item 1 as possible (high value), and I'm relatively indifferent to item 5 (low value). Let's consider a counteroffer where I give Player 1 the remaining units of items they asked for, and keep most of item 1.\n\nA possible counteroffer is: [1, 1, 0, 0, 5].\nThis means I keep:\n- Item 1: 3 - 1 = 2\n- Item 2: 4 - 1 = 3\n- Item 3: 3 - 0 = 3\n- Item 4: 4 - 0 = 4\n- Item 5: 6 - 5 = 1\n\nValue of this to me:\n(2 * 72) + (3 * 15) + (3 * 19) + (4 * 18) + (1 * 12) = 144 + 45 + 57 + 72 + 12 = 330\n\nSince 330 > 280, this is a good counteroffer.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. It's round 2, and Player 1 has offered me [1, 3, 5, 1, 3]. This means they are offering me 1 unit of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the value of this offer to me:\n\n*   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 19 = 19\n*   3 units of item 2: 3 * 68 = 204\n*   5 units of item 3: 5 * 22 = 110\n*   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 40 = 40\n*   3 units of item 5: 3 * 78 = 234\n*   Total value of offer: 19 + 204 + 110 + 40 + 234 = 607\n\nNow I need to consider the discount factor. Since it is round 2, the discount factor is 0.98^(2-1) = 0.98.  Therefore, the present value of the current offer is 607 * 0.98 = 594.86.\n\nMy outside offer is 720. Since 594.86 is less than 720, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's think about a possible counteroffer. To make a counteroffer worthwhile, it needs to be better than my outside option after the discount factor. That means the value needs to be higher than 720/0.98 = 734.69. It's difficult to determine the other player's values so coming up with a successful counteroffer is hard. Given the current offer is already well below my outside offer, I'm likely to get more by walking away.\n\nTherefore, my best course of action is to walk away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Since 861 < 1075, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. My goal is to maximize my value, but I also need to make the offer appealing to Player 1. Since it's round 1, I have the most leverage. Let's consider offering Player 1 an equal split of all items.

We can formulate this as solving for x, such that my offer to Player 1 keeps at least value 1075.\n\nLet the offer to Player 1 be x1, x2, x3, x4, x5. Then I would have\n(4 - x1) * 58 + (4 - x2) * 43 + (5 - x3) * 94 + (5 - x4) * 39 + (7 - x5) * 28 >= 1075\n232 - 58x1 + 172 - 43x2 + 470 - 94x3 + 195 - 39x4 + 196 - 28x5 >= 1075\n1265 - (58x1 + 43x2 + 94x3 + 39x4 + 28x5) >= 1075\n58x1 + 43x2 + 94x3 + 39x4 + 28x5 <= 190\n\nIf x1 = 1, x2 = 1, x3 = 1, x4 = 1, x5 = 1 then 58 + 43 + 94 + 39 + 28 = 262, which exceeds 190.\nThis shows that any offer I make to Player 1 where they receive one of each item will result in me getting less than my outside option.\nTherefore, I should walk.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Since 818 < 1028, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider a possible counteroffer. I want to maximize my value. Given the time constraint of 3 rounds and the discount factor, I need to make an offer that is better than my outside option, and that Player 1 is likely to accept. I will start by seeing what an even split would look like.\n\nGiving Player 1 half of each item is impossible because there are an odd number of some items, so I will calculate a reasonable distribution and offer it to player 1. In round 1, it might be advantageous to offer a better deal to increase the chance of agreement, as there is less discounting involved. I will offer player 1:\nItem 1: 1\nItem 2: 3\nItem 3: 2\nItem 4: 3\nItem 5: 2\n\nThis would leave me with:\nItem 1: 2 units * 19 = 38\nItem 2: 3 units * 87 = 261\nItem 3: 3 units * 95 = 285\nItem 4: 3 units * 12 = 36\nItem 5: 3 units * 28 = 84\nTotal value: 38 + 261 + 285 + 36 + 84 = 704\nThat is still less than my outside option, so it's not a good counteroffer.\n\nI need to offer Player 1 less to increase my personal value from the offer. If I keep most of item 3 since my value of that item is very high, I might be able to construct a good counteroffer. I'll start by keeping 4 of item 3 for myself and making sure my total value exceeds my outside offer.\n\nLet's try offering Player 1:\nItem 1: 1\nItem 2: 3\nItem 3: 1\nItem 4: 3\nItem 5: 2\n\nThis leaves me with:\nItem 1: 2 units * 19 = 38\nItem 2: 3 units * 87 = 261\nItem 3: 4 units * 95 = 380\nItem 4: 3 units * 12 = 36\nItem 5: 3 units * 28 = 84\nTotal value: 38 + 261 + 380 + 36 + 84 = 799\n\nThis is still lower than my outside option of 1028.\n\nHow about I offer the current offer back to the other player, to gauge where they are at?\nOffer [0, 1, 3, 4, 1] to Player 1.\n\nMy value = 818, and outside offer is 1028, so a walk is better than this offer.\nLet's make another counteroffer. I'll try to keep more items with high value to me.\n\nOffer player 1:\nItem 1: 3\nItem 2: 6\nItem 3: 5\nItem 4: 6\nItem 5: 5\n\nThis results in me keeping 0 of everything. So I get a value of 0. Which is terrible.\n\nGiven I only have three rounds, and my outside offer is 1028, and the current offer is only worth 818, I will walk away.\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n",

The total number of items is 3 + 4 + 7 + 6 + 3 = 23.\n\nMy total value for all items is 1147. Player 1's value is unknown. Let's make a counteroffer where I keep most of the high-value items (item 2 and item 5) and give Player 1 more of the others.\nLet's try offering Player 1: [2, 2, 5, 4, 2]. This means I would keep:\nItem 1: 3 - 2 = 1\nItem 2: 4 - 2 = 2\nItem 3: 7 - 5 = 2\nItem 4: 6 - 4 = 2\nItem 5: 3 - 2 = 1\nMy value for this would be: (1 * 41) + (2 * 81) + (2 * 49) + (2 * 10) + (1 * 99) = 41 + 162 + 98 + 20 + 99 = 420\nThis is still too low compared to my outside offer.\n\nLet's try an offer where I take almost everything.

Let me propose keeping all of item 5, most of item 2 and one of item 1 and walking if this is rejected.\nLet's offer Player 1: [2, 3, 7, 6, 0]. I get item 5 entirely (value 3 * 99 = 297), one of item 1 (value 1 * 41 = 41), one of item 2 (value 1 * 81 = 81). Total value is 297 + 41 + 81 = 419. Still low but better than the current offer.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the best choice is to walk.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Item 5: 95 per unit\n2. Item 3: 39 per unit\n3. Item 4: 37 per unit\n4. Item 1: 22 per unit\n5. Item 2: 6 per unit\n\nIdeally, I'd keep item 5, most of items 3 and 4, and some of item 1, while giving away most of item 2.\n\nLet me craft an initial offer (what I give to Player 2):\n- Item 1: I'll offer 2 out of 5 units (keeping 3 for myself)\n- Item 2: I'll offer 3 out of 4 units (keeping 1 for myself)\n- Item 3: I'll offer 2 out of 6 units (keeping 4 for myself)\n- Item 4: I'll offer 1 out of 4 units (keeping 3 for myself)\n- Item 5: I'll offer 0 out of 1 unit (keeping 1 for myself)\n\nThis means I'm keeping:\n- 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 22 = 66\n- 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 6 = 6\n- 4 units of item 3: 4 \u00d7 39 = 156\n- 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 37 = 111\n- 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 95 = 95\nTotal for me: 434\n\nThis is much better than my outside offer of 89, and gives Player 2 something reasonable to work with.
