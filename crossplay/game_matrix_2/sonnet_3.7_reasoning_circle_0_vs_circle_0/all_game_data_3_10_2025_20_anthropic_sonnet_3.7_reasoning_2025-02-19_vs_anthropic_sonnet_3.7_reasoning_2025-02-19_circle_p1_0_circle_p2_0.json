Given this is the final round, I should consider that Player 2 will likely WALK if my counteroffer is worse for them than their current offer or outside option.\n\nBased on their previous counteroffers, Player 2 seems to value items 2 and 5, and possibly item 4. They've consistently requested those items. Since I don't value item 5 much (only 1 point), and my highest value items are 1, 2, 3, and 4, I should try to keep more of those.\n\nI could offer [2, 1, 0, 3, 2] - giving them 2 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 3 of item 4, and 2 of item 5.\n\nThis would leave me with 3 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\nValue: (3\u00d780) + (1\u00d790) + (2\u00d776) + (5\u00d778) + (0\u00d71) = 240 + 90 + 152 + 390 + 0 = 872\n\nHowever, the improvement is minor and creates risk. Since this is the final round, if I make a counteroffer and Player 2 doesn't accept, it may result in a WALK, giving me only my outside option of 296.\n\nThe current offer value (827.86) is much better than my outside option (296), and only slightly worse than my potential counteroffer's value after discounting.

I should keep most of the items I value highly (items 3 and 4), while giving up items I value less (items 2 and 5).\n\nTotal items: 7 of item 1, 6 of item 2, 6 of item 3, 8 of item 4, 3 of item 5\n\nMy ideal allocation would be:\n- Keep most of item 3 (68 value per unit)\n- Keep most of item 4 (36 value per unit)\n- Keep some of item 1 (25 value per unit)\n- Give up most of item 2 and 5 (2 value per unit each)\n\nA potential counteroffer (what I give to Player 1):\n[2, 5, 1, 2, 2]\n\nThis would mean I keep:\n- 5 units of item 1 = 5 \u00d7 25 = 125\n- 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 2 = 2\n- 5 units of item 3 = 5 \u00d7 68 = 340\n- 6 units of item 4 = 6 \u00d7 36 = 216\n- 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 2 = 2\n\nTotal value to me = 125 + 2 + 340 + 216 + 2 = 685\n\nThis is still less than my outside offer of 832, but it's round 1, so there's room for negotiation. However, since my outside option is so strong, I should consider just walking away.\n\nGiven that my outside offer (832) is significantly higher than both the current offer (304) and my potential counteroffer (685), walking away is the most rational choice.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Since this is the last round, any counteroffer I make would be followed by Player 2's turn, where they'd either accept or walk. Given their previous offers, they seem to value items 1, 2, and 5 highly.\n\nI'll try one final counteroffer that keeps most of my high-value items while offering enough to potentially be attractive to Player 2:\n- I keep: [2, 1, 4, 5, 5]\n- Player 2 gets: [0, 0, 1, 5, 1]\n\nMy valuation of this counteroffer:\n- Item 1: 2 units \u00d7 95 = 190\n- Item 2: 1 unit \u00d7 93 = 93\n- Item 3: 4 units \u00d7 82 = 328\n- Item 4: 5 units \u00d7 39 = 195\n- Item 5: 5 units \u00d7 65 = 325\nTotal: 1131 \u00d7 0.9604 = 1086.21\n\nThis is better than my outside offer of 1049, and it's similar to my previous offer in round 2.\n\nHowever, given that this is the final round and Player 2 will have the last move, there's a high risk they'll walk away if I make a counteroffer. My outside offer (1049) is quite good, so walking away is a reasonable option.\n\nAfter considering all factors, I think walking away is the best option since my outside offer exceeds the value of the current offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Let me analyze the situation:\n\nMy values per unit:\n- Item 1: $85 (2 units total)\n- Item 2: $66 (2 units total)\n- Item 3: $83 (2 units total)\n- Item 4: $50 (3 units total)\n- Item 5: $26 (6 units total)\n\nTotal items value to me:\n- Item 1: 2 \u00d7 $85 = $170\n- Item 2: 2 \u00d7 $66 = $132\n- Item 3: 2 \u00d7 $83 = $166\n- Item 4: 3 \u00d7 $50 = $150\n- Item 5: 6 \u00d7 $26 = $156\nTotal value: $774\n\nMy outside offer is $161, so I need to get more than that from the negotiation to make it worthwhile.\n\nStrategy:\n1. I should keep items with higher value to me and offer items with lower value.\n2. Since I don't know Player 2's values, I'll make a reasonable first offer that keeps most high-value items.\n3. I want to give away items that have lower value-per-unit to me.\n\nFor my initial offer, I'll keep most of the high-value items (1 and 3) and give Player 2 more of the lower-value items:\n- Give 0 units of item 1 (keeping all 2 for myself)\n- Give 1 unit of item 2 (keeping 1 for myself)\n- Give 0 units of item 3 (keeping all 2 for myself)\n- Give 1 unit of item 4 (keeping 2 for myself)\n- Give 4 units of item 5 (keeping 2 for myself)\n\nValue of what I'm keeping:\n- Item 1: 2 \u00d7 $85 = $170\n- Item 2: 1 \u00d7 $66 = $66\n- Item 3: 2 \u00d7 $83 = $166\n- Item 4: 2 \u00d7 $50 = $100\n- Item 5: 2 \u00d7 $26 = $52\nTotal: $554\n\nThis gives me a value of $554, which is significantly better than my outside offer of $161. I'm offering Player 2 items worth $220 to me, which is a starting point for negotiation.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 1, 4]}",

This suggests Player 1 likely values item 2 highly and items 3 and 4 less.\n\nSince I value items 3 and 4 highly, I want to keep all of them. Item 2 has moderate value to me, but Player 1 seems to want it all, suggesting high value to them. Item 5 has almost no value to me (1), so I'm happy to give it away.\n\nI'll make a counteroffer where I keep all of items 3 and 4, most of item 2, and split item 1, while giving away item 5.\n\nMy counteroffer (what I give to Player 1): [1, 2, 0, 0, 1]\nThis means I would keep: [1, 5, 4, 5, 0]\nValue to me: 1\u00d76 + 5\u00d723 + 4\u00d785 + 5\u00d796 + 0\u00d71 = 6 + 115 + 340 + 480 + 0 = 941\n\nThis counteroffer should give Player 1 items they seem to value while letting me keep what I value most.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 0, 0, 1]}",
