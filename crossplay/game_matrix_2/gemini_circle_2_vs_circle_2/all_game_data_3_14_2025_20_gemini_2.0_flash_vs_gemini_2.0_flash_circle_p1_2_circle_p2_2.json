I need to decide whether to WALK away and take my outside offer of 1479, or make an initial offer.\n\nMy private values for the items are:\n- Item 1: 95 (7 units)\n- Item 2: 70 (6 units)\n- Item 3: 9 (7 units)\n- Item 4: 94 (2 units)\n- Item 5: 89 (3 units)\n\nMy total value for all items is 1603. I want to maximize my outcome, considering the discount factor of 0.98.\n\nSince it's Round 1, there's no penalty for making a counteroffer. I will aim for a favorable split, but also one that Player 2 might find acceptable, to avoid a walk away.  I will start by offering Player 2 slightly more than half of the total value if the items were evenly split assuming a value of 1 for simplicity. That's not a very good approach, but let's look at the total possible value (1603) and start by offering half of that in value. This would be about 800. Let's craft an offer where the value of the items I'm giving to Player 2 is approximately 800. Given that I want to keep most of the valuable items 1, 4, and 5, I will have to give Player 2 most or all of the less valuable ones.\n\nLet's offer Player 2:\n- Item 1: 0 units (value to me: 0 to Player 2)\n- Item 2: 3 units (value to me: 210 to Player 2)\n- Item 3: 6 units (value to me: 54 to Player 2)\n- Item 4: 0 units (value to me: 0 to Player 2)\n- Item 5: 1 unit (value to me: 89 to Player 2)\n\nThis gives player 2 total value to me equal to 353. To increase it to 800 value to me, I need to add some additional items, preferrably item 2 or 5. Let's increase Item 2 by 2.\n\n- Item 1: 0 units (value to me: 0)\n- Item 2: 5 units (value to me: 350)\n- Item 3: 6 units (value to me: 54)\n- Item 4: 0 units (value to me: 0)\n- Item 5: 1 unit (value to me: 89)\n\nThe total value offered to player 2 is 493. If I give them another unit of item 5, it adds 89. This means the offer would be 582. Let's instead add one unit of item 2:\n\n- Item 1: 0 units\n- Item 2: 6 units (420)\n- Item 3: 6 units (54)\n- Item 4: 0 units\n- Item 5: 1 unit (89)\n\nTotal offer value is 563. I am not going to try to reach a specific number. I will make this offer and see what Player 2 says.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 6, 6, 0, 1]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the current offer and determine the best action for Player 2.\n\nThe current offer is [0, 6, 6, 0, 1], meaning Player 1 is offering me 0 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n\nMy values for each item are:\n- Item 1: 55\n- Item 2: 12\n- Item 3: 92\n- Item 4: 35\n- Item 5: 28\n\nLet's calculate the value of the current offer to me:\n- 0 * 55 = 0\n- 6 * 12 = 72\n- 6 * 92 = 552\n- 0 * 35 = 0\n- 1 * 28 = 28\nTotal value = 0 + 72 + 552 + 0 + 28 = 652\n\nMy outside offer is 1174.

I have:\n- 7 units of item 1\n- 6 units of item 2\n- 7 units of item 3\n- 2 units of item 4\n- 3 units of item 5\n\nI need to decide how many units of each item to offer to Player 1. Let's aim for a counteroffer that gives me slightly more than my outside offer, accounting for the discount factor in later rounds. I'll aim for a total value of about 1174 / 0.98 = 1198 (approximately).\nAlso, the total value of all items is 1255, which is 7*55 + 6*12 + 7*92 + 2*35 + 3*28 = 385 + 72 + 644 + 70 + 84.\n\nI will try to keep as much of item 3 as possible, and be more willing to give away items 2 and 5.\n\nLet's try offering Player 1 the following: [3, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I keep 4 units of item 1, all units of item 2 and item 3, item 4 and item 5.\n\nMy value would then be: 4*55 + 6*12 + 7*92 + 2*35 + 3*28 = 220 + 72 + 644 + 70 + 84 = 1090. That's still less than my outside offer.\n\nLet's try to keep more item 3. If I offer [7, 6, 7, 2, 3] I get 0. I should offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] to player 1. That gives me 1255. I should make a moderate counter offer.\nI can try offering the player [3, 3, 3, 1, 1].\nThen my value is 4*55 + 3*12 + 4*92 + 1*35 + 2*28 = 220+36+368+35+56 = 715.\n\nLet's aim for a number in between the current offer and my outside offer.\n\nSince the current offer gives me 652, and my outside offer is 1174, I will make a counteroffer to give myself a value of ~ 1000.\nCounteroffer to Player 1: [4, 3, 4, 1, 1].

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. It's round 2, and Player 2 has offered me [2, 1, 0, 0, 0]. This means I would get:\n\n*   Item 1: 8 - 2 = 6 units\n*   Item 2: 6 - 1 = 5 units\n*   Item 3: 3 - 0 = 3 units\n*   Item 4: 4 - 0 = 4 units\n*   Item 5: 0 - 0 = 0 units\n\nNow, let's calculate the value of this offer to me:\n\n*   Item 1: 6 * 79 = 474\n*   Item 2: 5 * 46 = 230\n*   Item 3: 3 * 44 = 132\n*   Item 4: 4 * 92 = 368\n*   Item 5: 0 * 67 = 0\n\nTotal value = 474 + 230 + 132 + 368 + 0 = 1204\n\nNow, we need to apply the discount factor for round 2 (gamma = 0.98):\n\nDiscounted value = 1204 * (0.98)^(2-1) = 1204 * 0.98 = 1180\n\nMy outside offer is worth 1217. Since the discounted value of the current offer (1180) is less than my outside offer (1217), I should not accept.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. Since it's round 2, I need to decide if there's an offer I can make that Player 2 will accept and that is better for me than walking away. Given that the negotiation will end after round 3 and the discount will apply, I want a deal now rather than later.\n\nLet's consider offering Player 2 their first offer [1, 0, 0, 0, 0], which would give me [7, 6, 3, 4, 0]. This would give me a value of:\n7 * 79 + 6 * 46 + 3 * 44 + 4 * 92 + 0 * 67 = 553 + 276 + 132 + 368 + 0 = 1329. Discounting by 0.98, we get 1329 * 0.98 = 1302.42, which is more than my outside option.\n\nNow, I need to figure out what this counteroffer is worth to player 2. Player 2 values are not known. I am going to go ahead and make an offer that is slightly better for me than walking, just to try to get a deal done.\n\nLet's offer [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] again.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. It's round 2. Player 1 is offering me [1, 0, 0, 0, 0], meaning I get 1 unit of item 1 and nothing of the other items.\n\nMy values are: 19 for item 1, 69 for item 2, 81 for item 3, 77 for item 4, 43 for item 5.\nMy outside offer is 946.\nGamma is 0.98.\n\nIf I accept the current offer, I get 1 unit of item 1, which is worth 1 * 19 = 19.  This is multiplied by the discount factor 0.98^(2-1) = 0.98. So, the value of accepting is 19 * 0.98 = 18.62. This is far less than my outside offer of 946.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. I want to maximize my value, and I know there are 8 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5 available.\n\nSince it's round 2, and there are only 3 rounds total, I need to make a reasonable offer to have a chance of a deal. Let's calculate the total value if I take everything:\n8 * 19 + 6 * 69 + 3 * 81 + 4 * 77 + 0 * 43 = 152 + 414 + 243 + 308 + 0 = 1117.\n\nMy outside offer is 946. So, any deal has to be worth at least 946/0.98 = 965.30.\nI will aim for a counteroffer that gets me at least this value.\n\nLet's see if offering an even split of everything is good. This will leave me with:\n4 * 19 + 3 * 69 + 1.5 * 81 + 2 * 77 + 0 * 43 = 76 + 207 + 121.5 + 154 + 0 = 558.5.\nThis is way below my threshold.\n\nSince Player 1 is only asking for item 1 in previous offers. I'll aim to maximize my value by giving player 1 some of item 1 and item 2. Player 1 offered me only 1 unit of item 1.\nI will try offering player 1 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4 and 0 units of item 5. This leaves me with:\n(8-4) * 19 + (6-3) * 69 + (3-0) * 81 + (4-0) * 77 + (0-0) * 43 =\n4 * 19 + 3 * 69 + 3 * 81 + 4 * 77 + 0 * 43 = 76 + 207 + 243 + 308 = 834\n\nSince 834 * 0.98 = 817.32 < 946, this is too low.\nLet's try offering only item 1, to see if it reaches my value of 946/0.98 = 965.3. I want to keep (965.3/0.98)/19 units which is above 50. Clearly, this would require giving player 1 a negative amount.\n\nLet's give player 1 2 units of item 1, and 1 unit of item 2. This leaves me with:\n(8-2) * 19 + (6-1) * 69 + 3 * 81 + 4 * 77 = 6 * 19 + 5 * 69 + 3 * 81 + 4 * 77 = 114 + 345 + 243 + 308 = 1010.\n1010 * 0.98 = 989.8 > 946\n\nSo, I will offer [2, 1, 0, 0, 0] to player 1.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

Let's try offering Player 2:\n*   Item 1: 0\n*   Item 2: 1\n*   Item 3: 1\n*   Item 4: 2\n*   Item 5: 1\n\nThis leaves me with:\n*   Item 1: 0\n*   Item 2: 1\n*   Item 3: 1\n*   Item 4: 2\n*   Item 5: 1\n\nMy value for this outcome is: (0 * 29) + (1 * 88) + (1 * 38) + (2 * 3) + (1 * 19) = 0 + 88 + 38 + 6 + 19 = 151\n\nSince 151 > 71, this is acceptable for me, even before considering the discount factor.\n\nNow, I'll create the offer for Player 2.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 1, 2, 1]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the current offer and determine the best action for Player 2.\n\nThe current offer is [0, 1, 1, 2, 1]. This means Player 1 is offering me:\n- 0 units of item 1\n- 1 unit of item 2\n- 1 unit of item 3\n- 2 units of item 4\n- 1 unit of item 5\n\nMy values are:\n- Item 1: 47\n- Item 2: 37\n- Item 3: 46\n- Item 4: 71\n- Item 5: 65\n\nSo, the value of the current offer to me is:\n(0 * 47) + (1 * 37) + (1 * 46) + (2 * 71) + (1 * 65) = 0 + 37 + 46 + 142 + 65 = 290\n\nMy outside offer is 366.\n\nSince 290 is less than my outside offer of 366, I should not accept the current offer. Now let's consider making a counteroffer.\n\nI want to maximize my value while giving Player 1 enough to accept. It's round 1, so the discount factor is 0.98^(1-1) = 1.\n\nI have:\n- 0 units of item 1\n- 2 units of item 2\n- 2 units of item 3\n- 4 units of item 4\n- 2 units of item 5\n\nTo make a counteroffer, I need to offer Player 1 some of these items. Let's start by making an offer that is marginally better than my outside option, so it leaves room for negotiation and potentially better outcome if Player 1 has a high outside option. Let's make a counteroffer where I keep 1 unit of items 2, 3, 4, and 5. This will gives me 37+46+71+65 = 219 value. Therefore I have 2-1 = 1 unit of item 2, 2-1=1 unit of item 3, 4-1=3 unit of item 4, and 2-1=1 unit of item 5 to offer Player 1. Thus the counteroffer to Player 1 should be [0, 1, 1, 3, 1].\n\nThe value I would receive with this offer is 219, which is less than the 366 outside offer so I will need to improve my position. I will try to keep the amount of value I offer to Player 1 roughly the same while keeping the items with higher value per unit to myself.\n\nI will give Player 1 the following: [0, 2, 2, 0, 0]\nThis gives me the value: 0+0+0+4*71+2*65 = 284 + 130 = 414.\n\nOkay, 414 is more than my outside offer.

This means I get:\n- 0 units of item 1\n- 2 units of item 2\n- 2 units of item 3\n- 0 units of item 4\n- 0 units of item 5\n\nThe value of this offer to me is:\n(0 * 29) + (2 * 88) + (2 * 38) + (0 * 3) + (0 * 19) = 0 + 176 + 76 + 0 + 0 = 252\n\nSince it is round 2, we need to multiply this by discount factor.\nDiscount factor = 0.98^(2-1) = 0.98\nSo the value of the offer = 252*0.98 = 246.96\n\nSince 246.96 > 71, it's better than my outside offer. However, I can try to get more by making a counteroffer.\nPlayer 2's previous offer was [0, 2, 2, 0, 0]. My offer in round 1 was [0, 1, 1, 2, 1].\nThis implies that player 2 values items 2 and 3 a lot, and doesn't value items 4 and 5.\n\nLet's consider offering player 2 all of items 2 and 3, which they seem to value the most, in return for most of items 4 and 5. This means I'd offer player 2 [0, 2, 2, 0, 0] and keep [0, 0, 0, 4, 2] for myself. My value would be (0*29) + (0*88) + (0*38) + (4*3) + (2*19) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 12 + 38 = 50.\nDiscounted value would be 50 * 0.98 = 49. This is much worse than the outside offer.\n\nWhat if I offered [0, 1, 1, 4, 2]? I'd be getting [0, 1, 1, 0, 0].

Let's offer [0, 1, 1, 2, 1]. This will leave me with [0, 1, 1, 2, 1]. The value for me is (0*29) + (1*88) + (1*38) + (2*3) + (1*19) = 0 + 88 + 38 + 6 + 19 = 151\n151*0.98 = 147.98, which is better than my outside offer but worse than the current offer of 246.96.\n\nGiven that it's round 2 and the current offer is already better than my outside option, I think the best strategy is to accept it to avoid the risk of walking away in the last round.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\nThe current offer gives me 3 units of item 5. My value for item 5 is 84 per unit. So, the value of the current offer to me is 3 * 84 = 252.\n\nMy outside offer is 673.\n\nSince 252 < 673, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away and taking my outside offer. Therefore, I should not accept.\n\nNow, let's consider a counteroffer. Since it's round 1, I have some room to negotiate. I will aim for a deal that gives me a value greater than 673. I need to figure out a reasonable offer that Player 1 might accept while still giving me enough value. Player 1 started by wanting all units of item 5.\n\nI have:\n- 3 units of item 1 (value 13 each)\n- 2 units of item 2 (value 72 each)\n- 2 units of item 3 (value 61 each)\n- 3 units of item 4 (value 43 each)\n- 6 units of item 5 (value 84 each)\n\nTotal value = (3 * 13) + (2 * 72) + (2 * 61) + (3 * 43) + (6 * 84) = 39 + 144 + 122 + 129 + 504 = 938\n\nLet's try offering Player 1 a bit more than half of the total value, focusing on items they might value more. I'll give them all of item 1, half of item 2 and half of item 3, and 1 unit of item 4, and 4 units of item 5. This translates to the counteroffer: [3, 1, 1, 1, 4]\n\nThis would leave me with:\n- 0 units of item 1\n- 1 unit of item 2 (value 72)\n- 1 unit of item 3 (value 61)\n- 2 units of item 4 (value 86)\n- 2 units of item 5 (value 168)\n\nMy total value from this is 72 + 61 + 86 + 168 = 387. Hmm, this is still less than my outside offer of 673.\n\nLet's give them 2 of item 5 instead. That makes my counteroffer [3, 1, 1, 1, 2]. I keep 4 of item 5 now, so the total value to me from this is 72 + 61 + 86 + (4*84) = 72 + 61 + 86 + 336 = 555. Still not there.\n\nLet's only give them 1 of item 5. Counteroffer: [3, 1, 1, 1, 1].\nNow I have:\n- 0 units of item 1\n- 1 unit of item 2 (value 72)\n- 1 unit of item 3 (value 61)\n- 2 units of item 4 (value 86)\n- 5 units of item 5 (value 420)\n\nTotal value is 72 + 61 + 86 + 420 = 639. Still less than 673.\n\nLet's try an offer that is much more in my favor. How about I give them 0 units of anything. I keep everything!\nCounteroffer: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. That would mean I get 938! Great. I'll start with that offer and see what they do.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n",

I'm getting nothing. My outside offer is 821. I need to decide whether to accept nothing, walk away, or make a counteroffer. Walking away guarantees me 821.\n\nA key factor is the discount rate of 0.98.\n\nLet's consider making a counteroffer. I need to offer Player 2 *something* to make a deal possible. I will first calculate the total value of the items to me, and then think of a potentially acceptable offer.\n* Item 1: 3 * 60 = 180\n* Item 2: 2 * 47 = 94\n* Item 3: 2 * 89 = 178\n* Item 4: 3 * 69 = 207\n* Item 5: 6 * 77 = 462\nTotal Value: 180 + 94 + 178 + 207 + 462 = 1121\n\nTo get a deal that's better than walking away, I need to get at least 821 / 0.98 = 837.76 worth of items.\n\nI will offer the other player 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n\nThis means I keep 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n\nMy value is therefore: 1*60 + 1*47 + 1*89 + 1*69 + 3*77 = 60 + 47 + 89 + 69 + 231 = 496. Since 496 < 837.76, I should not make this offer.\n\nI will instead try to make an offer that gives me more. I will offer 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 unit of item 3, 1 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\nThis means I keep 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5.\nMy value is therefore: 2*60 + 1*47 + 2*89 + 2*69 + 4*77 = 120 + 47 + 178 + 138 + 308 = 791. Since 791 < 837.76, I should not make this offer either.\n\nIf I keep all the items, my value is 1121.\nIf I give away *almost* everything, and keep say, only item 5. I would have a value of 462, which is less than my outside offer.\n\nTherefore, I think my best option is to walk away.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

I will aim for a split that gives me more of the items I value highly (item 2) and less of the items I value less.\n\nRemaining quantities of items:\n- Item 1: 4 - 2 = 2\n- Item 2: 1 - 0 = 1\n- Item 3: 5 - 2 = 3\n- Item 4: 4 - 1 = 3\n- Item 5: 8 - 3 = 5\n\nHere is a potentially good first counteroffer that gives Player 1 half of the available items, giving them a small amount of item 2 (the most valuable) and more of the remaining items.\nCounteroffer: [2, 0, 2, 2, 3]\n\nThe total value of the remaining items would be:\nItem 1: (4 - 2) * 46 = 92\nItem 2: (1 - 0) * 83 = 83\nItem 3: (5 - 2) * 32 = 96\nItem 4: (4 - 2) * 12 = 24\nItem 5: (8 - 3) * 23 = 115\nTotal: 92 + 83 + 96 + 24 + 115 = 410\n\nValue to Player 2 of the offer:\nItem 1: 2 * 46 = 92\nItem 2: 1 * 83 = 83\nItem 3: 3 * 32 = 96\nItem 4: 2 * 12 = 24\nItem 5: 5 * 23 = 115\nTotal: 92 + 83 + 96 + 24 + 115 = 410\n\nCounteroffer: [2, 0, 2, 2, 3]\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 2, 2, 3]}\n",

I want to make an offer that's attractive enough for Player 2 to accept, but also leaves me with a good amount of value. I don't know Player 2's values, so I'll start by assuming they want a fair share of the total value.\n\nThe total number of items are 7 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 4 = 23 items.\nMy total value is (7 * 91) + (3 * 94) + (4 * 27) + (5 * 27) + (4 * 51) = 637 + 282 + 108 + 135 + 204 = 1366.\n\nIf I offer Player 2 half of the items, my value should be greater than my outside option. Since I don't know the opponent's preferences, I'll start by offering slightly more than half the value. This means my offer would be (close to) half of what I possess. If Player 2's values are similar, they'd likely accept. Let's try to offer a value such that my remaining value is greater than 975. This leaves 1366 - 975 = 391 for the other player, before discounting.\n\nI want to keep as much of item 1 and item 2 as possible because my values for these are the highest.\nI'll start by offering generous amounts of item 3, item 4, and item 5, and small amounts of item 1 and item 2.\nLet's say I offer Player 2:\n- 2 units of item 1 (2 * 91 = 182 to Player 2, I keep 5 * 91 = 455).\n- 1 unit of item 2 (1 * 94 = 94 to Player 2, I keep 2 * 94 = 188).\n- 3 units of item 3 (3 * 27 = 81 to Player 2, I keep 1 * 27 = 27).\n- 4 units of item 4 (4 * 27 = 108 to Player 2, I keep 1 * 27 = 27).\n- 3 units of item 5 (3 * 51 = 153 to Player 2, I keep 1 * 51 = 51).\n\nTotal value offered to Player 2 = 182 + 94 + 81 + 108 + 153 = 618.\nMy value remaining would be: 455 + 188 + 27 + 27 + 51 = 748.\n\nThis isn't great. I am still under my outside offer of 975.\nLet's offer a smaller value to Player 2:\n- 1 unit of item 1 (1 * 91 = 91 to Player 2, I keep 6 * 91 = 546)\n- 0 unit of item 2 (0 * 94 = 0 to Player 2, I keep 3 * 94 = 282)\n- 2 unit of item 3 (2 * 27 = 54 to Player 2, I keep 2 * 27 = 54)\n- 2 unit of item 4 (2 * 27 = 54 to Player 2, I keep 3 * 27 = 81)\n- 2 unit of item 5 (2 * 51 = 102 to Player 2, I keep 2 * 51 = 102)\nTotal value offered to Player 2 = 91 + 0 + 54 + 54 + 102 = 301\nMy value remaining would be: 546 + 282 + 54 + 81 + 102 = 1065.\n\nNow my remaining value 1065 is greater than my outside option of 975.

Let's start with an offer that's easy to calculate. I have 7 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5.  A basic offer to player 1 could be [3, 1, 2, 2, 2]. Let's see how that would value for me.\nI would get:\nItem 1: 7 - 3 = 4\nItem 2: 3 - 1 = 2\nItem 3: 4 - 2 = 2\nItem 4: 5 - 2 = 3\nItem 5: 4 - 2 = 2\n\nMy value would be:\n(4 * 27) + (2 * 48) + (2 * 39) + (3 * 91) + (2 * 27) = 108 + 96 + 78 + 273 + 54 = 609\n\nSince 609 > 429, this is better than walking away. I could also potentially try to make an offer slightly more in Player 1's favor to increase the likelihood they accept.\n\nLet's try the offer [3, 1, 2, 3, 2].\nI would get:\nItem 1: 7 - 3 = 4\nItem 2: 3 - 1 = 2\nItem 3: 4 - 2 = 2\nItem 4: 5 - 3 = 2\nItem 5: 4 - 2 = 2\nValue to me: (4 * 27) + (2 * 48) + (2 * 39) + (2 * 91) + (2 * 27) = 108 + 96 + 78 + 182 + 54 = 518\nSince 518 > 429, this offer is also better than walking away. Since this is only round 1, it's probably better to make a more aggressive offer to see how player 1 will react.\n\nTherefore, I will make the counteroffer [3, 1, 2, 2, 2].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 1, 2, 2, 2]}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 2, 2, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 1, 2, 2, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 1, 2, 2, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. It's round 2, and Player 2 has offered me [3, 1, 2, 2, 2]. My private values are 91, 94, 27, 27, 51. My outside offer is 975. The discount factor is 0.98.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of Player 2's offer to me:\n*   3 units of item 1: 3 * 91 = 273\n*   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 94 = 94\n*   2 units of item 3: 2 * 27 = 54\n*   2 units of item 4: 2 * 27 = 54\n*   2 units of item 5: 2 * 51 = 102\nTotal value of offer = 273 + 94 + 54 + 54 + 102 = 577\n\nNow, we need to consider the discount factor. This is round 2, so the discount factor is 0.98^(2-1) = 0.98. Therefore, the present value of Player 2's offer to me is 577 * 0.98 = 565.46.\n\nSince my outside offer is 975, and the present value of the current offer is 565.46, accepting would be worse than walking away. I need to make a counteroffer.\n\nTo form my counteroffer, I'll consider the items where I have the highest value. Those are item 1 and item 2. Let's try to construct an offer that is appealing to me, but also gives something to Player 2. I have 7 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5.\n\nPlayer 1 offered [1, 0, 2, 2, 2] in round 1. I countered with [3, 1, 2, 2, 2]. We're not far off.\n\nLet's try offering Player 2 [2, 0, 1, 1, 1]. This would leave me with:\n*   5 units of item 1: 5 * 91 = 455\n*   3 units of item 2: 3 * 94 = 282\n*   3 units of item 3: 3 * 27 = 81\n*   4 units of item 4: 4 * 27 = 108\n*   3 units of item 5: 3 * 51 = 153\nTotal value to me: 455 + 282 + 81 + 108 + 153 = 1079\nPresent value: 1079 * 0.98 = 1057.42\n\nThis is significantly better than my outside offer.

I need to estimate what a reasonable offer might be. Since I don't know Player 2's values, I'll assume they are also trying to maximize their value. I will aim for a split that gives me more than my outside offer while giving them a decent amount.\n\nTo start, let's calculate the total value of all items for me:\n* Item 1: 3 units * 48 = 144\n* Item 2: 6 units * 84 = 504\n* Item 3: 8 units * 57 = 456\n* Item 4: 5 units * 26 = 130\n* Item 5: 4 units * 75 = 300\n* Total Value = 144 + 504 + 456 + 130 + 300 = 1534\n\nMy outside offer is 787, so I want to secure more than that.\nI will start with an offer that gives Player 2 slightly less than half the total value.

This would give me:\n* Item 1: 3 units\n* Item 2: 6 units\n* Item 3: 8 units\n* Item 4: 5 units\n* Item 5: 4 units\n\nThe value of this to me is:\n(3 * 24) + (6 * 61) + (8 * 44) + (5 * 3) + (4 * 85) = 72 + 366 + 352 + 15 + 340 = 1145\n\nHowever, this is unlikely to be accepted.\n\nI need to decide whether to accept the current offer of value 559 or make a counteroffer. I believe a counteroffer should aim to improve my position while still being somewhat reasonable to Player 1. Since I have a substantial amount of each item, I should try to skew the offer in my favor.\n\nLet's consider giving the following to Player 1: [0, 2, 3, 1, 1].\nThis leaves me with:\nItem 1: 3\nItem 2: 4\nItem 3: 5\nItem 4: 4\nItem 5: 3\nMy value: (3 * 24) + (4 * 61) + (5 * 44) + (4 * 3) + (3 * 85) = 72 + 244 + 220 + 12 + 255 = 803\n\nNow consider a slightly more aggressive counteroffer: [0, 2, 3, 1, 0].\nThis leaves me with:\nItem 1: 3\nItem 2: 4\nItem 3: 5\nItem 4: 4\nItem 5: 4\nMy value: (3 * 24) + (4 * 61) + (5 * 44) + (4 * 3) + (4 * 85) = 72 + 244 + 220 + 12 + 340 = 888\n\nI will make the slightly more aggressive counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 3, 1, 0]}\n```",

Therefore, accepting the current offer is better than walking away *right now*.\n\nHowever, it might be better to try and get a *better* deal. Let's see what my previous offer was. In Round 1, I offered [0, 2, 3, 1, 0].

However, Player 1 rejected that initial split. What can I do?\n\nA possible alternative to accepting or replicating my previous offer is to offer a split somewhere between the previous two offers, which *might* be accepted. Another approach is to accept. Since the current offer is significantly better than my outside offer, the gains I might receive from attempting to bargain again might not be worth the risk that Player 1 will walk away and I will lose 524.3.\n\nI will choose to accept the current offer of [0, 3, 4, 2, 2] to guarantee a large payout.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Okay, let's break down the optimal strategy for Player 1 in this negotiation.\n\n**Understanding the Situation**\n\n*   **My Values:** I highly value item 2 (94) and item 1 (79). Item 5 is the least valuable (19).\n*   **Outside Offer:** My outside offer is 36. This is my guaranteed minimum.\n*   **Goal:** Maximize my discounted value, taking into account my outside offer.\n*   **Game Length:** 3 rounds with a discount factor of 0.98.\n*   **Player 2's Perspective:** I don't know Player 2's values or outside offer. This means I need a strategy that is robust to different possibilities.\n\n**Reasoning**\n\n1.  **Last Round (Round 3):** If we reach round 3, Player 2 will make a final offer (which will be treated as a walk if not accepted). Since Player 2 effectively has all the power in the last round, they will offer me just enough to make me indifferent between accepting and taking my outside option (36). Given the discount factor, I want the value of my end offer to be more than my outside offer *discounted* back to the first round (36 / (0.98 * 0.98)) = ~37.45.\n\n2.  **Round 2:** Player 2 is in a similar position to me now, but they need to ensure that I am getting more value than my outside offer would give me if I were to walk away at round 1. Given my high values for Items 1 and 2, I need to be careful not to give them all of these.\n\n3.  **Round 1 (Now):** I need to make an initial offer that's appealing enough for Player 2 to consider, but also leaves me with a good portion of the items. I should also keep in mind that I want the negotiation to continue to round 2 to allow me to make the first choice there. Given the discounting, later round are generally better.\n\n**Strategy**\n\n*   I will start with a relatively generous offer, targeting a split where I retain items 1 and 2, since those have the largest value for me. I will offer half of the rest, as that is likely enough to keep Player 2 interested while still yielding me a good value.\n*   The alternative is to offer all the units of Items 3, 4, and 5 to Player 2 and also one unit of item 1, and 0 units of item 2. This seems to also be a generous offer.\n\n**Calculation**\n\nLet's calculate my value if I give Player 2 the following:\n    * Item 1: 1 units\n    * Item 2: 0 units\n    * Item 3: 1 unit\n    * Item 4: 1 unit\n    * Item 5: 2 unit\nMy value would then be:\n    * Item 1: 4 * 79 = 316\n    * Item 2: 1 * 94 = 94\n    * Item 3: 2 * 41 = 82\n    * Item 4: 2 * 47 = 94\n    * Item 5: 3 * 19 = 57\n    Total: 316 + 94 + 82 + 94 + 57 = 643\n\nIf I offered the following:\n    * Item 1: 1 units\n    * Item 2: 0 units\n    * Item 3: 3 unit\n    * Item 4: 3 unit\n    * Item 5: 5 unit\nMy value would then be:\n    * Item 1: 4 * 79 = 316\n    * Item 2: 1 * 94 = 94\n    * Item 3: 0 * 41 = 0\n    * Item 4: 0 * 47 = 0\n    * Item 5: 0 * 19 = 0\n    Total: 316 + 94 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 410\n\nLet's calculate my value if I give Player 2 the following:\n    * Item 1: 2 units\n    * Item 2: 0 units\n    * Item 3: 1 unit\n    * Item 4: 1 unit\n    * Item 5: 2 unit\nMy value would then be:\n    * Item 1: 3 * 79 = 237\n    * Item 2: 1 * 94 = 94\n    * Item 3: 2 * 41 = 82\n    * Item 4: 2 * 47 = 94\n    * Item 5: 3 * 19 = 57\n    Total: 237 + 94 + 82 + 94 + 57 = 564\n\nLet's calculate my value if I give Player 2 the following:\n    * Item 1: 2 units\n    * Item 2: 0 units\n    * Item 3: 1 unit\n    * Item 4: 1 unit\n    * Item 5: 3 unit\nMy value would then be:\n    * Item 1: 3 * 79 = 237\n    * Item 2: 1 * 94 = 94\n    * Item 3: 2 * 41 = 82\n    * Item 4: 2 * 47 = 94\n    * Item 5: 2 * 19 = 38\n    Total: 237 + 94 + 82 + 94 + 38 = 545\n\nLet's calculate my value if I give Player 2 the following:\n    * Item 1: 2 units\n    * Item 2: 0 units\n    * Item 3: 1 unit\n    * Item 4: 1 unit\n    * Item 5: 1 unit\nMy value would then be:\n    * Item 1: 3 * 79 = 237\n    * Item 2: 1 * 94 = 94\n    * Item 3: 2 * 41 = 82\n    * Item 4: 2 * 47 = 94\n    * Item 5: 4 * 19 = 76\n    Total: 237 + 94 + 82 + 94 + 76 = 583\n\nLet's calculate my value if I give Player 2 the following:\n    * Item 1: 3 units\n    * Item 2: 0 units\n    * Item 3: 2 unit\n    * Item 4: 2 unit\n    * Item 5: 3 unit\nMy value would then be:\n    * Item 1: 2 * 79 = 158\n    * Item 2: 1 * 94 = 94\n    * Item 3: 1 * 41 = 41\n    * Item 4: 1 * 47 = 47\n    * Item 5: 2 * 19 = 38\n    Total: 158 + 94 + 41 + 47 + 38 = 378\n\nOffering [2, 0, 1, 1, 2] leaves me with 564, which is significantly higher than my outside offer, and the offer to Player 2 seems pretty good.\n\n**Action**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 1, 1, 2]}\n```",

Since 96.04 > 36, accepting the offer is better than walking away *at this moment*. However, let's consider what I could get by making a counteroffer.\n\nIn round 1, I offered Player 2 [2, 0, 1, 1, 2]. Player 2 countered with [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]. This suggests Player 2 doesn't value Item 1, Item 3, and Item 4 much, and they seem to want Item 5. They might value Item 2 too, we cannot make a claim on it as Player 2 did not offer it in their counter offer.\n\nLet's calculate the value of my initial offer to me:\nI offered Player 2 [2, 0, 1, 1, 2].\nThis means I keep [5-2, 1-0, 3-1, 3-1, 5-2] = [3, 1, 2, 2, 3].\nValue to me: (3*79) + (1*94) + (2*41) + (2*47) + (3*19) = 237 + 94 + 82 + 94 + 57 = 564\nDiscounted value = 564 * 0.98 = 552.72\n\nSince the discounted value of current offer is 96.04 and the discounted value of my initial offer in the first round to me is 552.72, I should make a counter offer.\n\nI'll try to get more value by offering Player 2 a bit more of what they seem to want (Item 5) while keeping the items I value most. I can offer them [1, 0, 0, 0, 2], meaning I keep [4, 1, 3, 3, 3].\n\nValue to me: (4*79) + (1*94) + (3*41) + (3*47) + (3*19) = 316 + 94 + 123 + 141 + 57 = 731\nDiscounted value: 731 * 0.98 = 716.38\n\nThis is better than the previous offer and walking away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 0, 2]}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Let's analyze the situation.\n\nMy values are: item 1: 96, item 2: 14, item 3: 100, item 4: 91, item 5: 72.\nI have 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\nMy outside offer is 672.\nThe discount factor is 0.98.\n\nPlayer 1 (me) initially offered [1, 0, 2, 3, 0] to Player 2. This means I would have kept 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\nPlayer 2 then offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] to me. So I receive nothing and Player 2 gets everything.\n\nIf I accept Player 2's current offer of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], I get nothing, so my value is 0. This is much worse than my outside offer of 672.\n\nI need to consider what a good counteroffer would be. Since this is round 2, the discount factor is 0.98^(2-1) = 0.98.\n\nLet's calculate the value of keeping everything for myself:\n2 * 96 + 1 * 14 + 4 * 100 + 5 * 91 + 1 * 72 = 192 + 14 + 400 + 455 + 72 = 1133.\nDiscounted value = 1133 * 0.98 = 1110.34\n\nI will make a counteroffer that gives Player 2 slightly more than half of the total possible value. I'll try to keep the items I value most.\nLet's aim for a value of approximately 570 for Player 2 (slightly more than half of 1133).\n\nI will offer the following:\nItem 1: 1 unit (value to me = 96)\nItem 2: 1 unit (value to me = 14)\nItem 3: 2 units (value to me = 200)\nItem 4: 2 units (value to me = 182)\nItem 5: 0 units (value to me = 0)\nCounteroffer: [1, 1, 2, 2, 0]\nThis means I keep:\nItem 1: 1 unit (value to me = 96)\nItem 2: 0 unit (value to me = 0)\nItem 3: 2 units (value to me = 200)\nItem 4: 3 units (value to me = 273)\nItem 5: 1 unit (value to me = 72)\n\nMy value from this offer is 96 + 0 + 200 + 273 + 72 = 641.\nDiscounted value = 641 * 0.98 = 628.18\n\nThis is still less than my outside option.  Let's change my offer to be more aggressive. I will offer Player 2 only a small amount of item 4.\n\nItem 1: 2 unit (value to me = 0)\nItem 2: 1 unit (value to me = 0)\nItem 3: 4 units (value to me = 0)\nItem 4: 1 units (value to me = 91 * 4 = 364)\nItem 5: 1 units (value to me = 0)\nCounteroffer: [2, 1, 4, 1, 1]\nThis means I keep:\nItem 1: 0 unit (value to me = 0)\nItem 2: 0 unit (value to me = 0)\nItem 3: 0 units (value to me = 0)\nItem 4: 4 units (value to me = 91 * 4= 364)\nItem 5: 0 unit (value to me = 0)\n\nMy value from this offer is 364.\nDiscounted value = 364 * 0.98 = 356.72\nThis is less than my outside offer.\n\nI will try an offer to Player 2 that is better than my outside offer.\n\nItem 1: 0 units\nItem 2: 0 units\nItem 3: 0 units\nItem 4: 0 units\nItem 5: 0 units\nThis gives me a value of 1133 * 0.98 = 1110.34\n\nCounteroffer: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

It's round 1, and there's no offer on the table yet. I need to make an initial offer to Player 2.\n\nSince I want to maximize my value, I should start by making an offer that is slightly better than my outside offer for Player 2.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the current situation and determine the best course of action for Player 2.\n\nThe current offer on the table is [0, 0, 0, 1, 0], meaning Player 1 is offering me 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n\nMy values for each item are:\n- Item 1: 88\n- Item 2: 3\n- Item 3: 88\n- Item 4: 17\n- Item 5: 49\n\nTherefore, the value of the current offer to me is (0 * 88) + (0 * 3) + (0 * 88) + (1 * 17) + (0 * 49) = 17.\n\nMy outside offer is 735.\n\nSince 17 is significantly less than my outside offer of 735, accepting the current offer is not a good option. I need to decide whether to walk away or make a counteroffer.  Given that this is round 1 and there are two more rounds of negotiation possible, walking away immediately is likely suboptimal. I should try to negotiate a better deal.\n\nTo formulate a counteroffer, I need to consider what Player 1 might value. Without knowing their values, a simple approach is to propose an equal split, or something close to it. This maximizes the chance of reaching an agreement and avoid defaulting to my outside option. I have 3 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5. An approximate even split (giving to player 1) is:\n\n- Item 1: 1\n- Item 2: 0\n- Item 3: 1\n- Item 4: 2\n- Item 5: 2\n\nThis corresponds to the offer [1, 0, 1, 2, 2] to Player 1. Let's calculate my value if this offer is accepted.\n\nIf Player 1 accepts my offer of [1, 0, 1, 2, 2], then I get:\nItem 1: 3 - 1 = 2 units\nItem 2: 1 - 0 = 1 units\nItem 3: 3 - 1 = 2 units\nItem 4: 5 - 2 = 3 units\nItem 5: 4 - 2 = 2 units\n\nMy total value is:\n(2 * 88) + (1 * 3) + (2 * 88) + (3 * 17) + (2 * 49) = 176 + 3 + 176 + 51 + 98 = 504\n\nSince I want at least 735 (my outside offer), I need to propose something that gets me a better deal.\n\nHere's a potentially better counteroffer strategy: Let's offer Player 1 the items I value the least, and keep the items I value the most. This might entice them to accept and give me a better outcome.\nI value item 2 (3) and item 4 (17) the least. Let's offer them most of these: [0, 1, 0, 4, 0].\n\nIf I offer [0, 1, 0, 4, 0], I keep:\nItem 1: 3 units = 3 * 88 = 264\nItem 2: 0 units = 0 * 3 = 0\nItem 3: 3 units = 3 * 88 = 264\nItem 4: 1 unit = 1 * 17 = 17\nItem 5: 4 units = 4 * 49 = 196\nMy total value = 264 + 0 + 264 + 17 + 196 = 741\n\nThis counteroffer yields me a value of 741, which is more than my outside offer of 735. It is a reasonable opening offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 4, 0]}\n```",

I'll keep most of it.\n* Item 4 is a single unit. I'll keep it since it is worth 60 to me.\n\nLet's start by offering 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\nThe value of this offer to Player 1, if valued by me is: (1 * 70) + (1 * 98) + (1 * 56) + (0 * 60) + (2 * 65) = 70 + 98 + 56 + 0 + 130 = 354\n\nLet's increase the offer to 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\nValue = 140 + 98 + 56 + 0 + 130 = 424\n\nLet's offer them 2 units of item 1, 2 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\nValue = 140 + 196 + 56 + 0 + 130 = 522\n\nThis looks like a reasonable starting point. I am giving Player 1 enough items for a reasonable negotiation.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 1, 0, 2]}\n```",

Since 458.64 is significantly less than 752, I should not accept this offer.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. I want to get as close to 752 as possible. I will offer Player 2 a deal that is slightly above what I think they would accept but still gives me a higher value than walking away and getting 752. Since this is round 2, I need to factor in the discount rate of 0.98.\n\nI'll try offering Player 2 only the minimum of each item: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].

This is below my outside offer value.\n\nSince it's round 2, Player 2 is likely to accept if I offer them very little. Let's try to capture as much value as possible.

I'm also going to refine my counteroffer to be even more favorable to me.\n\nLet's offer them [3, 3, 2, 1, 3]. That leaves me with:\nItem 1: 1 * 70 = 70\nItem 2: 1 * 98 = 98\nItem 3: 1 * 56 = 56\nItem 4: 0 * 60 = 0\nItem 5: 1 * 65 = 65\nTotal Value: 70 + 98 + 56 + 0 + 65 = 289\nDiscounted value: 289 * 0.98 = 283.22\n\n283.22 < 297.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

I need to decide whether to make an offer, walk away, or wait for an offer from Player 2. Since it's the first round, I have the initiative to make an offer.\n\nTo make a reasonable offer, I need to estimate Player 2's potential values. Since the values are uniformly distributed between 1 and 101, the expected value for each item for Player 2 is (1+101)/2 = 51. I will use this as a baseline to estimate Player 2's total value.\n\nI also need to consider my own item values and how they compare to the expected value for Player 2. I have high values for item 1 (63) and item 5 (96), and a low value for item 2 (6). My values for items 3 and 4 (43 and 36) are closer to the expected value.\n\nSince it's round 1, I have some time to negotiate. I want to make an offer that is attractive to Player 2 but still gives me a good share. I'll start by offering Player 2 slightly more than half the items, biased towards items where my value is low.\nSpecifically, I'll offer Player 2:\n- 3 units of item 1 (leaving me with 2)\n- 2 units of item 2 (leaving me with 1)\n- 1 unit of item 3 (leaving me with 1)\n- 5 units of item 4 (leaving me with 3)\n- 1 unit of item 5 (leaving me with 1)\n\nNow, let's calculate the value of what I would keep:\n- 2 units of item 1 = 2 * 63 = 126\n- 1 unit of item 2 = 1 * 6 = 6\n- 1 unit of item 3 = 1 * 43 = 43\n- 3 units of item 4 = 3 * 36 = 108\n- 1 unit of item 5 = 1 * 96 = 96\nTotal value = 126 + 6 + 43 + 108 + 96 = 379\n\nThis is significantly higher than my outside offer of 199.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 2, 1, 5, 1]}\n```",

To determine a reasonable counteroffer, I would ideally like to offer Player 1 the minimum possible while exceeding my outside offer, considering the discount factor in future rounds. However, this requires knowing player 1's valuation, and I do not. Given I only have 3 rounds, a reasonable strategy is to make a generous initial counteroffer, giving them less of each item than they initially requested, but only if that increases my payout above 725.\n\nLet's try offering Player 1 half of each item, rounded up.\nItem 1: 5 / 2 = 2.5, rounded up = 3\nItem 2: 3 / 2 = 1.5, rounded up = 2\nItem 3: 2 / 2 = 1\nItem 4: 8 / 2 = 4\nItem 5: 2 / 2 = 1\nCounteroffer: [3, 2, 1, 4, 1]\n\nThis means I would keep:\nItem 1: 5 - 3 = 2\nItem 2: 3 - 2 = 1\nItem 3: 2 - 1 = 1\nItem 4: 8 - 4 = 4\nItem 5: 2 - 1 = 1\n\nValue of this counteroffer to me:\n(2 * 31) + (1 * 95) + (1 * 25) + (4 * 60) + (1 * 46) = 62 + 95 + 25 + 240 + 46 = 468\n\nSince 468 < 725, this will not be a good counteroffer.

My private values are 46, 91, 21, 16, 97 for items 1 through 5, respectively. My outside offer is 266.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the value of the current offer to me:\n- 0 units of item 1: 0 * 46 = 0\n- 4 units of item 2: 4 * 91 = 364\n- 3 units of item 3: 3 * 21 = 63\n- 3 units of item 4: 3 * 16 = 48\n- 0 units of item 5: 0 * 97 = 0\nTotal value of current offer = 0 + 364 + 63 + 48 + 0 = 475\n\nSince 475 is greater than my outside offer of 266, accepting the current offer is better than walking away *in this round*.\n\nNow, I must consider if making a counteroffer could yield a better result, taking into account the discount factor of 0.98.\n\nLet's consider offering an even split. I have 2 units of item 1, 9 of item 2, 6 of item 3, 6 of item 4 and 2 of item 5.\nAn even split would be offering player 1: [1, 4, 3, 3, 1]\n\nIf I offered [1, 4, 3, 3, 1] that would mean I would keep: [1, 5, 3, 3, 1]\n- 1 unit of item 1: 1 * 46 = 46\n- 5 units of item 2: 5 * 91 = 455\n- 3 units of item 3: 3 * 21 = 63\n- 3 units of item 4: 3 * 16 = 48\n- 1 unit of item 5: 1 * 97 = 97\nTotal value = 46 + 455 + 63 + 48 + 97 = 709\n\nDiscounted value in round 2 is 709 * 0.98 = 694.82. It is likely that I would accept an offer better than my outside offer in round 2 if it came.\n\nInstead of an even split, let me try to make a counteroffer such that it is only slightly more advantageous for me than the original offer.\nI want to offer player 1 items in an amount that yields me a value slightly greater than 475, say ~480.\n\nTo do this, let's shift one unit of item 2 to myself and one unit of item 3, and one unit of item 4 to myself in the counteroffer. My counteroffer becomes [0, 3, 2, 2, 0]\nThat means I would keep [2, 6, 4, 4, 2] for a value of:\n(2*46) + (6*91) + (4*21) + (4*16) + (2*97) = 92 + 546 + 84 + 64 + 194 = 980.\nThis result is too high and likely unrealistic given the limited units available.\n\nLet's offer [1, 5, 3, 3, 1]. I would keep [1, 4, 3, 3, 1], for a value of:\n(1*46) + (4*91) + (3*21) + (3*16) + (1*97) = 46 + 364 + 63 + 48 + 97 = 618\nThis is significantly better than the current offer and better than my outside offer.\nThis looks like a good initial starting point.\n\nSo, my counteroffer is [1, 5, 3, 3, 1].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 5, 3, 3, 1]}\n```",

I need to decide whether to ACCEPT, WALK, or make a COUNTEROFFER.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the current offer to me:\n1 * 66 + 5 * 99 + 3 * 52 + 3 * 81 + 1 * 20 = 66 + 495 + 156 + 243 + 20 = 980\n\nSince this is round 2, we need to consider the discount factor of 0.98^(2-1) = 0.98.

Since 960.4 < 1144, accepting the offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. I want to maximize my value, so I need to figure out what counteroffer might be acceptable to Player 2 while still giving me a value greater than my outside offer, discounted by 0.98.\nSince I have 2 units of item 1, 9 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5 to divide, and the other player is currently offering me [1, 5, 3, 3, 1], they would get 2-1 = 1 unit of item 1, 9-5 = 4 units of item 2, 6-3 = 3 units of item 3, 6-3 = 3 units of item 4 and 2-1 = 1 unit of item 5.\n\nLet's think about how to extract more value. I need at least 1144/0.98 = 1167.35 value this round. I am getting 980 value currently.\n\nSince the previous offer from player 1 was [0, 4, 3, 3, 0] and the player countered with [1, 5, 3, 3, 1], it seems player 2 wants more of items 1 and 5.\nI will make a counter offer to take more item 2 and 4.

However, since it is round 1, I can potentially get a better deal by making a counteroffer.\n\nTo formulate a counteroffer, I need to consider what Player 1 might find acceptable and how much I value the items. Player 1 is keeping [2, 2, 2, 3, 1]. I want to maximize my value while still giving Player 1 enough to not walk away.\n\nLet's calculate my total value of all items:\n4 * 99 + 3 * 46 + 3 * 6 + 4 * 53 + 2 * 100 = 396 + 138 + 18 + 212 + 200 = 964\n\nNow, I will attempt to make a slightly more aggressive counteroffer. Let's offer Player 1 [1, 1, 1, 2, 0]. This means I would get [3, 2, 2, 2, 2].\n\nThe value of this new distribution to me would be:\n3 * 99 + 2 * 46 + 2 * 6 + 2 * 53 + 2 * 100 = 297 + 92 + 12 + 106 + 200 = 707\n\nSince 707 * 0.98 = 692.86 is greater than my outside offer, I should make the counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 2, 0]}\n```",

I have the following amounts of each item:\n- Item 1: 6 units\n- Item 2: 5 units\n- Item 3: 5 units\n- Item 4: 3 units\n- Item 5: 5 units\n\nI want to maximize my value, but I also need to offer Player 1 enough to make them accept. It's round 1, so there's a discount factor to consider in later rounds.\nSince I don't know player 1's preferences, it's difficult to propose an offer that is very close to my outside offer.\nLet's aim for an offer which is slightly better than splitting evenly. My total value for everything is 1907. If player 1 offered me half the total amount for him (ie. gave me half and kept half), his offer will be worth approximately 953.5 to me (without discounting). To make a counteroffer, I must give player 1 at least the amount they are giving me in this offer. \n\nPlayer 1 is offering me [2, 1, 1, 0, 1]. This means they are keeping [4, 4, 4, 3, 4]. Let me offer player 1 [3, 2, 2, 1, 2]. This means I keep [3, 3, 3, 2, 3].\nThe value to me of this split is: 3 * 96 + 3 * 95 + 3 * 78 + 2 * 87 + 3 * 41 = 288 + 285 + 234 + 174 + 123 = 1104.\nThis is still below my outside offer.\nIf I offer [0,0,0,0,0] the value to me is 1907.\n\nI think I will make a counteroffer that gives Player 1 what they are offering me:\n[2, 1, 1, 0, 1].

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. It's round 2, and Player 2 has just repeated my initial offer from round 1. The current offer on the table is that I receive 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of this offer to me:\n\n*   2 units of item 1: 2 * 50 = 100\n*   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 19 = 19\n*   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 99 = 99\n*   0 units of item 4: 0 * 65 = 0\n*   1 unit of item 5: 1 * 86 = 86\n\nTotal value of the current offer = 100 + 19 + 99 + 0 + 86 = 304\n\nNow, we need to consider the discount factor. Since it's round 2, the discount factor is 0.98^(2-1) = 0.98.\n\nDiscounted value of the current offer = 304 * 0.98 = 297.92\n\nMy outside offer value is 969. Since 297.92 is significantly less than 969, I should not accept the current offer.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. I need to propose an offer that gives Player 2 enough value to be better than walking away, but still leaves me with a value greater than my outside offer, when discounted. Let's aim for a counteroffer that gives me a value slightly better than my outside option of 969. I need to keep in mind the discount factor.\n969 / 0.98 is roughly 988.78. So, I am looking for a distribution of items such that the value to me is about 988.78.\n\nCurrently I value the entire set of items at 1515. I want the other player to get 1515 - 988.78 which is roughly 526.\n\nLet's try offering the following to Player 2: 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5.\nThis means I keep: 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\nThe value of these items to me is 2 * 50 + 1 * 19 + 1 * 99 + 1 * 65 + 1 * 86 = 100 + 19 + 99 + 65 + 86 = 369.\n\nLet's try giving player 2 less to start with. I will give 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 3 units of item 5 to player 2.\nThen I keep 3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 unit of item 4, and 2 units of item 5 for myself.\nMy total value: 3 * 50 + 2 * 19 + 2 * 99 + 2 * 65 + 2 * 86 = 150 + 38 + 198 + 130 + 172 = 688\nThat is too low.\nLet me keep 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5 for myself.\nSo I offer Player 2: 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\nMy total value: 4 * 50 + 3 * 19 + 3 * 99 + 2 * 65 + 3 * 86 = 200 + 57 + 297 + 130 + 258 = 942\nThe discounted value is 942*0.98 = 923.16 which is too low, it is still below my outside option of 969.\n\nLet's give 1 units of item 4 to player 2 as well. Thus, I give Player 2 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n\nThen I keep 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5 for myself.\nMy total value: 4 * 50 + 3 * 19 + 3 * 99 + 1 * 65 + 3 * 86 = 200 + 57 + 297 + 65 + 258 = 877\nThe discounted value is 877 * 0.98 = 859.46 which is below my outside option of 969.\n\nLet's go back to my original proposal, offering the following to Player 2: 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5. This means I keep: 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\nMy discounted value is 297.92.\nI will WALK.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Since this is round 1 and I have no offer on the table, I need to make an initial offer to Player 2. I need to figure out what to offer Player 2 such that they will accept it, or a slightly more aggressive offer, that leaves me with more value but a greater risk of a walk-away.\n\nA fair starting point is to divide the items roughly in proportion to their total value, but skewed slightly in my favor. This also helps me avoid a fast WALK by my opponent. A more complicated strategy might involve offering a large amount of items that I value very little.\n\nLet's calculate the total value if I keep everything:\n\n*   Item 1: 5 * 46 = 230\n*   Item 2: 8 * 32 = 256\n*   Item 3: 2 * 42 = 84\n*   Item 4: 7 * 65 = 455\n*   Item 5: 4 * 25 = 100\n*   Total: 1125\n\nSince my outside offer is 1045, I need to secure at least that much value.\n\nI will start with a relatively generous offer, biased towards the items I value less. I'll give Player 2: 2 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 2 unit of item 5.\n\nThis leaves me with: 3 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 4 of item 4, 2 of item 5.\n\nMy value would then be:\n*   Item 1: 3 * 46 = 138\n*   Item 2: 4 * 32 = 128\n*   Item 3: 1 * 42 = 42\n*   Item 4: 4 * 65 = 260\n*   Item 5: 2 * 25 = 50\n*   Total: 618\n\nThat's not enough, I need to make an offer that will give me more value than 1045 after discount.\n\nLet's offer Player 2 a small amount of each item. Say, 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 0 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5. This is a total of 5 items for player 2.\n\nThen I would get:\n*   Item 1: 4 * 46 = 184\n*   Item 2: 6 * 32 = 192\n*   Item 3: 2 * 42 = 84\n*   Item 4: 6 * 65 = 390\n*   Item 5: 3 * 25 = 75\n*   Total = 925\n\nStill too low. Let's reduce the amount of Items 2 and 5 I give to player 2.\n\nI will offer: 1 unit of item 1, 1 units of item 2, 0 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 0 unit of item 5.\n\nThen I would get:\n*   Item 1: 4 * 46 = 184\n*   Item 2: 7 * 32 = 224\n*   Item 3: 2 * 42 = 84\n*   Item 4: 6 * 65 = 390\n*   Item 5: 4 * 25 = 100\n*   Total = 982\n\nStill too low.

Since I know nothing about their valuations, I'm going to make an offer that's somewhat better than what they gave me, but still highly in my favor. I'll offer:\n[1, 2, 0, 2, 0]\n\nThis means I keep:\n\n*   Item 1: 4 units\n*   Item 2: 6 units\n*   Item 3: 2 units\n*   Item 4: 5 units\n*   Item 5: 4 units\n\nMy value is:\n\n(4 * 46) + (6 * 32) + (2 * 42) + (5 * 65) + (4 * 25) = 184 + 192 + 84 + 325 + 100 = 885\n\nDiscounted value = 885 * 0.98 = 867.3.\n\nThis is still less than my outside offer, but it's close enough that they might accept.

I need to figure out what to offer Player 1. I have the following items available:\n\n*   Item 1: 5 units\n*   Item 2: 8 units\n*   Item 3: 2 units\n*   Item 4: 7 units\n*   Item 5: 4 units\n\nTo maximize my value, I should try to keep the items I value most (item 4, then item 1) and give away items I value least (item 3, then item 5). Let's think about what would be attractive to Player 1. I don't know their values, so I have to guess, but presumably, they are trying to maximize their return as well.\n\n*   **Counteroffer 1: Player 1 gets a little of what they asked for last round**: \\[1, 2, 0, 2, 0]. This leaves me with [4, 6, 2, 5, 4]. The value to me is 4 * 68 + 6 * 37 + 2 * 17 + 5 * 81 + 4 * 26 = 272 + 222 + 34 + 405 + 104 = 1037. Discounted, it is 1037 * 0.98 = 1016.26. This is better than my outside offer.\n\n*   **Counteroffer 2: Player 1 gets a bit more Item 1 and 4**:  \\[2, 2, 0, 3, 0]. I keep [3, 6, 2, 4, 4]. The value to me is 3 * 68 + 6 * 37 + 2 * 17 + 4 * 81 + 4 * 26 = 204 + 222 + 34 + 324 + 104 = 888. Discounted, it is 888 * 0.98 = 870.24. This is also better than my outside offer.\n\n*   **Counteroffer 3: A bit more even distribution:** \\[2, 3, 1, 3, 1]. This means I keep [3, 5, 1, 4, 3]. Value to me: 3 * 68 + 5 * 37 + 1 * 17 + 4 * 81 + 3 * 26 = 204 + 185 + 17 + 324 + 78 = 808. Discounted: 808 * 0.98 = 791.84. Still better than my outside offer, but less than previous offers.\n\nSince this is round 2, I want to propose a counteroffer that is good for me but also appealing enough for player 1 to accept, as if they walk in round 3, I just get my outside offer value. Counteroffer 1 results in the highest value for me.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nI will make Counteroffer 1.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 0, 2, 0]}\n```",

The negotiation will last a maximum of 3 rounds, and there's a discount factor of 0.98.\n\nSince this is the first round and there's no offer on the table, I need to make an initial offer. I need to consider what would be acceptable to Player 2 while still giving me a value higher than my outside offer, accounting for the discount factor.\n\nFirst, let's consider what I have:\n* Item 1: 3 units, value 94/unit\n* Item 2: 1 unit, value 33/unit\n* Item 3: 2 units, value 79/unit\n* Item 4: 1 unit, value 70/unit\n* Item 5: 6 units, value 52/unit\n\nTotal value = (3 * 94) + (1 * 33) + (2 * 79) + (1 * 70) + (6 * 52) = 282 + 33 + 158 + 70 + 312 = 855\n\nI could try offering a split that gives me roughly half the value, hoping the other player's outside option is low. However, to ensure I get at least my outside offer of 834, I should make a more conservative offer. Let's consider making an offer that gives player 2 a considerable share. Since this is the first round, and there are two more rounds to go if the offer is rejected, I can start with a less favorable offer to the other player and revise it later if necessary.\n\nLet's try offering Player 2:\n* Item 1: 1 unit\n* Item 2: 0 unit\n* Item 3: 1 unit\n* Item 4: 0 unit\n* Item 5: 3 units\n\nThis means I keep:\n* Item 1: 2 units\n* Item 2: 1 unit\n* Item 3: 1 unit\n* Item 4: 1 unit\n* Item 5: 3 units\n\nMy value = (2 * 94) + (1 * 33) + (1 * 79) + (1 * 70) + (3 * 52) = 188 + 33 + 79 + 70 + 156 = 526\n\nThis is not higher than my outside option of 834.\n\nLet's try making Player 2 a more generous offer, aiming for roughly a 60-40 split in my favor. I need to offer Player 2 more. To do that, let's calculate how much value I need to offer to reach 834 if my offer is rejected in this round and the next (discounted at 0.98^2).\n\nSince the discount factor is significant over two rounds (0.98^2 = 0.9604), let's try offering something close to half the value in this first round.\n\nLet's offer:\n* Item 1: 1 unit\n* Item 2: 0 unit\n* Item 3: 0 unit\n* Item 4: 0 unit\n* Item 5: 3 unit\n\nI would keep:\n* Item 1: 2 units\n* Item 2: 1 unit\n* Item 3: 2 units\n* Item 4: 1 unit\n* Item 5: 3 units\n\nMy Value = (2*94) + (1*33) + (2*79) + (1*70) + (3*52) = 188 + 33 + 158 + 70 + 156 = 605\n\nThis is still far from my outside offer of 834, but I want to see how the other player responds before offering more.\n\nLet me try offering Player 2:\n* Item 1: 1 unit\n* Item 2: 0 units\n* Item 3: 0 units\n* Item 4: 0 units\n* Item 5: 3 units\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 0, 3]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 147. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player1, 2 units of each item (keeping 2 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 966 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 0, 0, 0, 4]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. It's round 2, and Player 1 has offered me [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means they are offering me nothing. My outside offer is 147. I need to determine if accepting this offer, walking away, or making a counteroffer is the best strategy.\n\nIf I accept Player 1's offer of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], I get nothing, which is worth 0.\n\nIf I walk away, I get my outside offer of 147.\n\nIf I make a counteroffer, it will be the last round, so it's essentially a take-it-or-leave-it offer. I want to make a counteroffer that Player 1 is likely to accept, while still maximizing my own value.\n\nLet's consider a few potential counteroffers and their values to me. My values for the items are 48, 94, 99, 77, and 4.  The total amounts are 3, 1, 2, 1, and 6.\n\n**Scenario 1: Give Player 1 nothing (offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0])**\n* I keep everything: 3 * 48 + 1 * 94 + 2 * 99 + 1 * 77 + 6 * 4 = 144 + 94 + 198 + 77 + 24 = 537\n* I get 537 * 0.98 = 526.26\n\n**Scenario 2: Offer a \"fair\" split based on quantities**\nSince I don't know Player 1's values, I can only guess at what might be considered fair. A simple split might be to give Player 1 roughly half the total items. Let's try something that slightly favors me, offering Player 1 [1, 0, 1, 0, 3].\n* Player 1 receives: 1 item 1, 0 item 2, 1 item 3, 0 item 4, 3 item 5.\n* I receive: 2 item 1, 1 item 2, 1 item 3, 1 item 4, 3 item 5.\n* My value = (2 * 48) + (1 * 94) + (1 * 99) + (1 * 77) + (3 * 4) = 96 + 94 + 99 + 77 + 12 = 378\n* 378 * 0.98 = 370.44\n\nSince 370.44 > 147, this is better than walking away.\n\n**Scenario 3: Trying to be greedy, offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]**\n* Player 1 receives: 0 item 1, 0 item 2, 0 item 3, 0 item 4, 1 item 5.\n* I receive: 3 item 1, 1 item 2, 2 item 3, 1 item 4, 5 item 5.\n* My value = (3 * 48) + (1 * 94) + (2 * 99) + (1 * 77) + (5 * 4) = 144 + 94 + 198 + 77 + 20 = 533\n* 533 * 0.98 = 522.34\n\n522.34 is still good, but I risk Player 1 walking away.\n\nGiven that the risk of Player 1 walking away in the final round is high, and my outside offer is 147, offering [1, 0, 1, 0, 3] seems to be the best balance between getting a good value and increasing the chances of a deal.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 0, 3]}\n```",
