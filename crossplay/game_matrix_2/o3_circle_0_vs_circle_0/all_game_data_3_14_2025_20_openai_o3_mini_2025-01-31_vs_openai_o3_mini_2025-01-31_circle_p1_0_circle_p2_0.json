                    "response": "I'll explain my reasoning briefly.\n\nMy total value if I received every unit would be 1060. To get a deal that I prefer to \u201cwalking away\u201d (my outside offer of 783) I must secure an allocation worth at least 783. In effect, I have a \u201cconcession budget\u201d of 1060 \u2013 783 = 277 (that is, I can \u201cgive away\u201d items whose total \u201cworth\u201d to me is at most 277). Knowing my own per\u2010unit values\u2014\n\u2003\u2022\u2003item 1: 50,\n\u2003\u2022\u2003item 2: 65,\n\u2003\u2022\u2003item 3: 69,\n\u2003\u2022\u2003item 4: 70,\n\u2003\u2022\u2003item 5: 7\u2014\nI want to concede primarily those items that cost me little while (likely) giving my opponent high \u201csubjective\u201d value. In particular, item 5 is very \u201ccheap\u201d for me (7 per unit) even though an opponent drawn from U[1,101] has expected per\u2010unit values of roughly 51. Similarly, among the remaining items item 1 costs me 50 per unit (lowest among items 1\u20134). By \u201cbuying\u201d each unit in item 1 I lose 50 while an opponent might well appreciate about 51 per unit. (The other items cost more to me, so conceding any of them would push my own share too low.) \n\nOne possible offer is to give the opponent 5 units of item 1 and all 2 units of item 5. Then my \u201ccost\u201d is 5\u00b750 + 2\u00b77 = 250 + 14 = 264, leaving my own share\u2019s value as 1060 \u2013 264 = 796, which is just above my reservation of 783. (My allocation in that case would be: item 1: 1 unit, item 2: all 4 units, item 3: all 4 units, item 4: all 3 units, item 5: 0 units.) \n\nFrom an opponent\u2019s perspective, if we assume his \u201caverage\u201d value per unit is roughly 51 then the offer gives him an \u201cexpected\u201d value of 5\u00b751 + 2\u00b751 = 357. Although that may seem low compared to the average expected outside offer, my own reservation forces me to be tough in round 1 if I wish to beat 783. (In later rounds I might have to concede more; here I\u2019m forced to \u201cgamble\u201d with a tough offer hoping that his actual private values\u2014or his outside offer\u2014are lower.)\n\nGiven all this, as Player 1 in round 1 I propose to offer Player 2 the following division: give Player 2 5 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and all 2 units of item 5.\n\nThus, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [5, 0, 0, 0, 2]}",

Since 209 > 174, the current offer is better than walking away immediately.\n\nStep 3: Consider the trade\u2010offs of a counteroffer. Although you might try to improve your allocation (for example, trying to get some of items 2, 3, or 4 which are very valuable to you), doing so might force the negotiation into further rounds. Because of the discount factor (gamma = 0.98) the value would drop in later rounds, and there is the risk that player 1 will reject your counteroffer. In round 1 the discount is 1, so it is best to secure a favorable outcome with full value, especially when your current deal already gives you a clear surplus over your outside offer.\n\nStep 4: Decision. Given that the current offer gives you a certain present value of 209 \u2013 which is comfortably above your outside option \u2013 and that prolonging the negotiation brings risks and a small discount, the rational action is to ACCEPT the current offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

(Of course I do not know Player\u00a02\u2019s precise values, but symmetry is a natural starting point.) \n\nLet me explain my reasoning. My total value if I received every unit was \n\u2003\u20035\u00d769 + 5\u00d721 + 5\u00d757 + 5\u00d741 + 7\u00d753 = 1311. \nMy private outside offer is 487, so any deal I get immediately (round 1, so no discount) should give me at least more than 487. An equally split deal (by my own numbers) would give me roughly half of 1311 (~655) and yield a similar amount for Player\u00a02 (roughly 656 in my perspective). (Note that even a \u201cfair\u201d split from my own perspective is above my disagreement value.) \n\nA division is determined by the offer I make: the list [n1, n2, n3, n4, n5] indicates exactly how many units of each item I will \u201cgive\u201d to Player\u00a02; I then get what remains. In other words, if I offer [a, b, c, d, e] then my allocation (by item) is:  \n\n\u2003\u2003item1: (5 \u2013 a)  \n\u2003\u2003item2: (5 \u2013 b)  \n\u2003\u2003item3: (5 \u2013 c)  \n\u2003\u2003item4: (5 \u2013 d)  \n\u2003\u2003item5: (7 \u2013 e)  \n\nMy resulting value is:  \n\u2003\u200369\u00d7(5 \u2013 a) + 21\u00d7(5 \u2013 b) + 57\u00d7(5 \u2013 c) + 41\u00d7(5 \u2013 d) + 53\u00d7(7 \u2013 e).  \n\nI would like my deal to yield about 655 in my utility. Since the full total is 1311, it is equivalent to offering Player\u00a02 a \u201cpackage\u201d valued (by my own numbers) at 1311 \u2013 655 = 656. In other words, I want to choose nonnegative integers a, b, c, d, e (within availability: a, b, c, d \u2208 [0,5] and e \u2208 [0,7]) satisfying: \n\n\u2003\u200369a + 21b + 57c + 41d + 53e = 656. \n\nOne solution is to set:  \n\u2003\u2003a = 3, b = 0, c = 2, d = 3, e = 4. \n\nLet\u2019s check:  \n\u2003\u200369\u00d73 = 207  \n\u2003\u200321\u00d70 = 0  \n\u2003\u200357\u00d72 = 114  \n\u2003\u200341\u00d73 = 123  \n\u2003\u200353\u00d74 = 212  \n\u2003\u2003Total = 207 + 0 + 114 + 123 + 212 = 656.  \n\nThen my allocation is:  \n\u2003\u2003item 1: 5 \u2013 3 = 2 units \u2192 2\u00d769 = 138  \n\u2003\u2003item 2: 5 \u2013 0 = 5 units \u2192 5\u00d721 = 105  \n\u2003\u2003item 3: 5 \u2013 2 = 3 units \u2192 3\u00d757 = 171  \n\u2003\u2003item 4: 5 \u2013 3 = 2 units \u2192 2\u00d741 = 82  \n\u2003\u2003item 5: 7 \u2013 4 = 3 units \u2192 3\u00d753 = 159  \n\u2003\u2003Sum = 138 + 105 + 171 + 82 + 159 = 655  \n\nThis gives me 655 (while in my perspective Player\u00a02 would get a package valued at 656). This is appealing to me since it is well above my outside offer\u2014and it is a fairly \u201cbalanced\u201d division from my viewpoint. \n\nThus, my action as Player\u00a01 in round 1 is to make this counteroffer. \n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 0, 2, 3, 4]}",

One viable division is to give away all of item 1 (5 units) and all of item 2 (5 units) and give away 3 units of item 4:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 For item 1: giving away 5 units costs 5\u00d722 = 110 (we keep 0 units)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 For item 2: giving away 5 units costs 5\u00d731 = 155 (we keep 0 units)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 For item 4: giving away 3 units costs 3\u00d747 = 141 (we keep 2 units)\nThe total \u201ccost\u201d (in terms of our value) is 110 + 155 + 141 = 406.\nSince our total value for all items is 1490, what we keep has value 1490 \u2013 406 = 1084 \u2013 exactly equal to our outside offer.\nFor the remaining items we give nothing away:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 3: give 0 (keep all 5 units)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 5: give 0 (keep all 7 units)\n\nThus, our proposed counteroffer is giving Player 1:\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 5, Item 2: 5, Item 3: 0, Item 4: 3, Item 5: 0.\nThat means our allocation would be:\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 0, Item 2: 0, Item 3: 5, Item 4: 2, Item 5: 7,\nand our overall value would be exactly 1084.\n\nStep 4: While this division leaves us just at our outside offer, it improves upon the current offer that gives us only 687 without risking a breakdown later in the negotiation.\n\nThus, our action in round 1 is to make this counteroffer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [5,5,0,3,0]}",

Player\u202f1\u2019s offer \u201c[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\u201d would give me: 1 unit of item\u202f1 and 1 unit of item\u202f2. With my private per\u2010unit values (item\u202f1 = 30, item\u202f2 = 97, \u2026) that totals 1\u00b730 + 1\u00b797 = 127. In contrast, my outside option is worth 332. So accepting this offer is not worthwhile.\n\n2. Now I can \u201ccounteroffer.\u201d In doing so I propose a division where I \u201cgive\u201d Player\u202f1 some items (the offer vector) and receive the remainder. (Recall: the items I receive are \u201ctotal available minus offer.\u201d) My goal is to get a deal whose (undiscounted) value for me exceeds 332 while giving Player\u202f1 just enough that\u2014according to what I expect about their situation\u2014they are at least as well off as by walking away. (Player\u202f1\u2019s private outside option is drawn from a similar process so its expected value is roughly on the order of 330\u2010ish.)\n\n3. My full pie (all items) is worth 877 to me if I were to get everything. I want to \u201ckeep\u201d as much of that value as possible. In selecting what to offer Player\u202f1, I\u2019d like to use the items I value cheaply. My private values per item are:\n\u2003\u2013 item\u202f1: 30 (cheapest)\n\u2003\u2013 item\u202f4: 51\n\u2003\u2013 item\u202f5: 82\n\u2003\u2013 item\u202f2: 97 (most expensive to me)\n\u2003\u2013 (item\u202f3 is 83 but none are available)\nI can \u201cafford\u201d to give away all of item\u202f1 (3 units available) without high cost. I can then use some of item\u202f4 (3 units total) as \u201ccheap\u201d credits. However, item\u202f1 plus item\u202f4 only add up to 3+3 = 6 units with my cost 3\u00b730 + 3\u00b751 = 90+153 = 243 \u2014 which in my mind is too \u201ccheap\u201d (i.e. it would likely be below what Player\u202f1 expects from his own outside offer, on average roughly 330 in value). Thus I must include one more unit from a \u201cslightly more expensive\u201d item; I choose item\u202f2 rather than item\u202f5 because item\u202f2 (97 per unit) is a bit higher than item\u202f5 (82) but it may help \u201clift\u201d the overall value offered to Player\u202f1 above his likely reservation level. \n\n4.

Let me check what that means:\n\u2003\u2013 What I \u201cgive\u201d (i.e. what Player\u202f1 gets) has, in my evaluation, the value:\n\u2003\u2003Item\u202f1: 3\u00b730 = 90\n\u2003\u2003Item\u202f2: 1\u00b797 = 97\n\u2003\u2003Item\u202f4: 3\u00b751 = 153\n\u2003\u2003Total = 90 + 97 + 153 = 340.\nThis is just above the rough expectation (about 332) that Player\u202f1 might be able to get from an outside offer.\n\u2003\u2013 My share then is the \u201crest of the items\u201d: \n\u2003\u2003Item\u202f1: 3\u20133 = 0, \n\u2003\u2003Item\u202f2: 4\u20131 = 3, \n\u2003\u2003Item\u202f3: 0, \n\u2003\u2003Item\u202f4: 3\u20133 = 0, \n\u2003\u2003Item\u202f5: 3\u20130 = 3.\nMy value for these is:\n\u2003\u2003Item\u202f2: 3\u00b797 = 291 \n\u2003\u2003Item\u202f5: 3\u00b782 = 246 \n\u2003\u2003Total = 291 + 246 = 537.\nThis is well above my own outside offer of 332.\n\n6. The offer is valid (it does not give more than are available on any item) and seems to provide Player\u202f1 with enough to be willing to agree while leaving me a high\u2010value share.\n\nThus, my response is to counteroffer by proposing that I \u201cgive\u201d Player\u202f1 the bundle [3, 1, 0, 3, 0].\n\nMy answer in the required format is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 1, 0, 3, 0]}",

My \u201cinside\u2010deal\u201d value is computed as the sum over items of (quantity I receive \u00d7 my private per\u2010unit value) and then discounted by \u03b3^(round\u20131). In the current proposal (Player 2\u2019s offer), I would receive [3,1,0,3,0]. That gives an undiscounted value for me of \n\u2003\u20033\u00d734 + 1\u00d756 + 0\u00d779 + 3\u00d791 + 0\u00d791 = 102 + 56 + 0 + 273 + 0 = 431.\nDiscounted in round 2 (factor 0.98): 431\u00d70.98 \u2248 421.\n2. My outside offer is 780. So if I accept the current offer I\u2019d get only \u2248421 whereas by \u201cwalking\u201d I\u2019d secure 780.\n3. In round 2 I have the option to make a counteroffer. In principle I might try to \u201cclaim\u201d nearly the entire pie. However, if I try to concede very little to Player 2 then his package (what he would get if he accepted my counteroffer) would be too little relative to his own reservation. To make a deal better than my 780 requires me to keep almost all items. But the maximum I can \u201cgive up\u201d (in my own terms) to still beat 780 is about 872 \u2013 (780/0.98) \u2248 76 (since my total undiscounted value is 872 and any deal will be discounted in round 2 by 0.98). The only concessions that cost me very little (e.g. 1 unit of item 1 is 34 for me, even 2 units of item 1 are 68) leave Player 2 with an offer that is likely far below what his own outside option would be (and even his likely private bundle value if he got the entire remainder). In short, any counteroffer that would let me get a discounted payoff \u2265780 would force me to offer Player 2 only a very small share\u2014and given that his own outside offer is drawn from [1, his total value] (and his expected total is lower than mine but still likely much larger than a couple of low\u2010value items) the offer would be very unattractive to him.\n4. In consequence, any counteroffer I could try in round 2 would be rejected by Player 2 so that the negotiation would eventually end with both parties \u201cwalking away.\u201d Since my outside offer guarantees 780 (which is far superior to the 421 value in the current offer) it is best for me to secure that 780 by walking away now.\n\nThus, my best (and rational) action in this round is to WALK.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

                    "response": "I will explain my reasoning and then give my action. \n\nLet me briefly summarize the situation. We must divide 5 types of items (quantities: item1 = 3, item2 = 1, item3 = 6, item4 = 5, item5 = 2) over three rounds. Each side\u2019s payoff is the sum (over items) of (number of units received \u00d7 private per\u2010unit value) and the overall outcome is discounted (by a factor of 0.98^(r\u20131) in round r). My private per\u2010unit values are: 40 (item1), 67 (item2), 55 (item3), 59 (item4), 58 (item5). Also, I have an outside option worth 31 while Player\u202f2\u2019s outside option is drawn from a uniform range from 1 to their total value (which, if they got everything, would be roughly up to 867 using an \u201caverage\u201d value around 51 per unit). (Note: 17 total units \u00d7 approximately 51 gives about 867.) \n\nBecause I propose first, I have a strategic advantage. In making an initial offer I want to \u201csell\u201d to Player\u202f2 on getting slightly more than what they could expect from walking away (and roughly what they might expect if the negotiation continues). At our values, even if we use the expected \u201caverage\u201d of about 51 for Player\u202f2\u2019s unknown private values, one can expect that a player rejecting the deal might get an outside offer on the order of the midpoint of [1,867] \u2013 roughly 434. \n\nI want to maximize my own payoff (928 total value if I got everything) while giving up \u201citems\u201d that matter less to me. My own item values order from \u201cleast costly\u201d to \u201cmost\u201d is: item1 (40) is cheapest, then item3 (55), then item5 (58), then item4 (59), and lastly item2 (67). That suggests that if I have to \u201cbuy\u201d Player\u202f2\u2019s agreement I should offer them the items I value low. \n\nA natural idea is to give Player\u202f2 all of item1 (3 units) and all of item3 (6 units). This means I am \u201coffering\u201d to let Player\u202f2 have 3+6 = 9 units (and from an expected average of about 51 per unit, that bundle is \u201cworth\u201d roughly 9\u00d751 = 459 \u2013 a bit above a typical outside value estimate of ~434). Meanwhile, I then keep the rest (item2 =1, item4 = 5, item5 =2) for myself. My own payoff then computes as:\n\u2003\u2022 item2: 1\u00d767 = 67\n\u2003\u2022 item4: 5\u00d759 = 295\n\u2003\u2022 item5: 2\u00d758 = 116\nTotal = 67 + 295 + 116 = 478.\n\nThus, with this counteroffer I give Player\u202f2 a bundle (items 1 and 3) that\u2014assuming typical private values\u2014should convince them that accepting now nets them more than their expected outside or future discounted prospect. At the same time, I keep the items I value more. \n\nBecause this is the first round (with no discount yet) and I have the initiative, I will propose to give Player\u202f2 all of item1 and item3, leaving me with the others. \n\nSo my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 0, 6, 0, 0]}",

We must do better than our fallback.\n\nStep 2: In this negotiation both players have private values and an outside option (for us 417, for Player 2 something drawn from an unknown but (on average) high number compared to items). While we do not know Player 2\u2019s precise values, a reasonable\u2010starting assumption is that their per\u2011unit values are drawn roughly uniformly between 1 and 101 \u2013 with an average near 51.

Our high\u2011valued items for us are items 1 and 2. Based on our own values, a good idea is to keep all available units of items 1 and 2. In contrast, item 4 is relatively \u201ccheap\u201d for us (only 25 per unit) but if Player 2\u2019s average is around 51 per unit, giving them item 4 entirely is a relatively inexpensive concession.

                    "response": "[0, 2, 1, 3, 3]\n\nMy reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. First I computed my total value if I got everything: \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 item 1: 2\u00d794 = 188  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 item 2: 2\u00d730 = 60  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 item 3: 3\u00d756 = 168  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 item 4: 3\u00d728 = 84  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 item 5: 7\u00d791 = 637  \n\u2003\u2003Total = 188+60+168+84+637 = 1137.\n\n2. I know my outside option gives a value of 393 (undiscounted since we\u2019re in round 1). Thus any acceptable agreement must leave me better off than 393 and should be attractive enough to Player 2 so that they prefer it over their own outside offer.\n\n3. Although I do not know Player 2\u2019s exact unit values (each drawn uniformly between 1 and 101), the expected value per unit is about 51. So if Player 2 got everything, their expected total would be roughly 51\u00d7(2+2+3+3+7)=867. Their reservation value (from their outside offer) is derived from a uniform draw over [1, their total], so it would typically be around half of 867, i.e. roughly 434. To induce early agreement (and avoid discounting) Player 2 should receive an expected amount not far below this.\n\n4. I can use my privately known values to \u201ctrade\u201d items. Notice that for me, items 1 and 5 are very valuable (94 and 91 each), whereas items 2 (30) and 4 (28) are especially \u201ccheap\u201d for me compared to the average expected 51. Item 3 (56) is just a little higher than 51. Thus a strategic split is to keep the items I highly prize (item 1, and mostly item 5) and offer Player 2 the items I don\u2019t value as much (items 2 and 4) and a small slice from one of the others to bump Player 2 above an expected value around 434.\n\n5. In the offer I propose, I give Player 2:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 0 units of item 1 (I keep both, to gain 2\u00d794 =188)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 2 units of item 2 (worth very little to me, total lost 2\u00d730)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 1 unit of item 3 (so I lose one unit at 56 instead of 51)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 3 units of item 4 (again low cost for me, since 3\u00d728)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 3 units of item 5 (though item 5 is very valuable to me, surrendering 1 unit loses 91 rather than 94 from item 1, and it brings Player 2\u2019s expected gain nearer to what they might require).\n\n6. Under this allocation the totals become:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 My allocation:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 item 1: 2 units \u2192 2\u00d794 = 188  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 item 2: 0  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 item 3: 2 units (from 3\u20131) \u2192 2\u00d756 = 112  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 item 4: 0 (from 3\u20133)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 item 5: 4 units (7\u20133) \u2192 4\u00d791 = 364  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003Total = 188+112+364 = 664.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Player 2\u2019s \u201cexpected\u201d value (if around 51/unit):  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 item 1: 0  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 item 2: 2\u00d751 = 102  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 item 3: 1\u00d751 = 51  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 item 4: 3\u00d751 = 153  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 item 5: 3\u00d751 = 153  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003Total \u2248 102+51+153+153 = 459.\n\n7. Hence, Player 2 is likely to view a value of about 459 (in expectation) as acceptable relative to their outside offer, while I secure a good surplus for myself (664 > 393) and preserve my most highly valued items.\n\nThus, in round 1 I propose the offer where I assign to Player 2 the following number of units per item: item 1: 0, item 2: 2, item 3: 1, item 4: 3, and item 5: 3.\n\nMy action is therefore:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 1, 3, 3]}",

                    "response": "Step\u2010by\u2010step reasoning:\n1. We first calculate our value under the current offer. The current offer gives us [0, 2, 1, 3, 3] units.

Our private outside offer is 367. Thus, accepting the present offer gives us 273, which is below our reservation value. We shouldn\u2019t accept.\n3. As Player 2 we can now propose a counteroffer. Recall that when we counteroffer we specify what we \u201cgive\u201d to Player 1; the items remaining (total minus our offered amounts) go to us.\n4. Let our counteroffer be represented as [x1, x2, x3, x4, x5] (to be given to Player 1). Then our bundle will be:\n\u2003\u2003item 1: 2 \u2013 x1  \n\u2003\u2003item 2: 2 \u2013 x2  \n\u2003\u2003item 3: 3 \u2013 x3  \n\u2003\u2003item 4: 3 \u2013 x4  \n\u2003\u2003item 5: 7 \u2013 x5.\n5. Our total value becomes:\n\u2003\u2003517 \u2013 (91\u00b7x1 + 7\u00b7x2 + 13\u00b7x3 + 73\u00b7x4 + 9\u00b7x5).\nTo secure at least our reservation of 367 we must have:\n\u2003\u2003517 \u2013 (91\u00b7x1 + 7\u00b7x2 + 13\u00b7x3 + 73\u00b7x4 + 9\u00b7x5) \u2265 367,\nwhich means\n\u2003\u200391\u00b7x1 + 7\u00b7x2 + 13\u00b7x3 + 73\u00b7x4 + 9\u00b7x5 \u2264 150.\n6. We wish to remain above our reservation value while trying to make an offer that might be acceptable to Player 1. We know from Player 1\u2019s initial offer that if accepted, they would get the complement: [2, 0, 2, 0, 4] (since the current offer to us was [0,2,1,3,3]). Likely Player 1 expects to have some of the high\u2010value items (from their own perspective) such as item 1 or maybe even item 4.\n7. However, our own private values show that items 1 and 4 are especially valuable to us (91 and 73 respectively), so we want to keep those. Thus we consider giving up items where our \u201ccost\u201d is lower (items 2, 3, and 5).\n8. One attractive possibility is to \u201cclaim\u201d all of item 1 and item 4 so that our bundle becomes:\n\u2003\u2003item 1: all 2 units, item 4: all 3 units.\nThis gives us a value of 2\u00d791 + 3\u00d773 = 182 + 219 = 401, which is well above our reservation.\n9. To remain within our \u201ccost budget\u201d of 150 we can offer Player 1 all of items 2 and 5, plus most of item 3 (keeping only enough for us to exceed 367).\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Giving Player 1 the full stock of item 2 (2 units) costs 2\u00d77 = 14.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Giving Player 1 the full stock of item 5 (7 units) costs 7\u00d79 = 63.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Giving Player 1 2 out of the 3 units of item 3 costs 2\u00d713 = 26.\n\u2003\u2003The total \u201ccost\u201d from relinquishing these items is 14 + 63 + 26 = 103, so our retained value is 517 \u2013 103 = 414.\n10. For balance, we may want to \u201cimprove\u201d the deal for Player 1 a little relative to their expected allocation in the current proposal. Player 1\u2019s original complement was [2,0,2,0,4] (from [0,2,1,3,3]). If we adjust our counteroffer slightly we can offer them items from a different mix. For example, if we propose to give them:\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 0 (we keep both)  \n\u2003\u2003Item 2: 2 (all of item 2)  \n\u2003\u2003Item 3: 2 (instead of 3, so we keep 1 unit)  \n\u2003\u2003Item 4: 0 (we keep all 3)  \n\u2003\u2003Item 5: 4 (instead of 7, so we keep 3 units)\nThen our bundle becomes:\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 2 \u2013 0 = 2\u2003\u2003\u2192 2\u00d791 = 182  \n\u2003\u2003Item 2: 2 \u2013 2 = 0\u2003\u2003\u2192 0  \n\u2003\u2003Item 3: 3 \u2013 2 = 1\u2003\u2003\u2192 1\u00d713 = 13  \n\u2003\u2003Item 4: 3 \u2013 0 = 3\u2003\u2003\u2192 3\u00d773 = 219  \n\u2003\u2003Item 5: 7 \u2013 4 = 3\u2003\u2003\u2192 3\u00d79 = 27  \n\u2003\u2003Total = 182 + 13 + 219 + 27 = 441.\n11.

Under our counteroffer, Player 1 would receive the allocation:\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 2 (since 2\u20130 = 2)  \n\u2003\u2003Item 2: 0 (since 2\u20132 = 0)  \n\u2003\u2003Item 3: 1 (3\u20132 = 1)  \n\u2003\u2003Item 4: 3 (3\u20130 = 3)  \n\u2003\u2003Item 5: 3 (7\u20134 = 3).\nRelative to the offer they just made (which would give them [2,0,2,0,4]), they lose one unit of item 3 but gain all of item 4.

                    "response": "Step\u2010by\u2010step reasoning:\n\n1. We note that the current offer on the table (giving us the following allocation: item1 = 0, item2 = 2, item3 = 2, item4 = 0, item5 = 4) would leave us with the remainder when compared against the overall items available ([2,2,3,3,7]). That means under the current offer, our \u201cshare\u201d is:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item1: 2 \u2013 0 = 2 units?\u2003\u2003[Actually, careful: the \u201coffer on the table\u201d is defined as \u201cthe amount of each item being offered to you\u201d. That means if it says [0,2,2,0,4] then YOU get exactly those units. (No \u201cremainder\u201d is allocated because these offer numbers are the quantities you receive.)]\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 So our received bundle would be:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 item1: 0 \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 item2: 2 \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 item3: 2 \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 item4: 0 \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 item5: 4\n\n2. Using our private values (item1: 94, item2: 30, item3: 56, item4: 28, item5: 91), the undiscounted value of this bundle is:\n\u2003\u20030\u00d794 + 2\u00d730 + 2\u00d756 + 0\u00d728 + 4\u00d791 = 0 + 60 + 112 + 0 + 364 = 536.\nSince we would be concluding in round 2 (discount multiplier = \u03b3^(r\u20131) = 0.98^(2\u20131) = 0.98), the actual value becomes 536 \u00d7 0.98 \u2248 524.48.\nThis is comfortably above our private outside offer of 393.\n\n3. However, we notice that although the current offer is \u201cgood\u201d from our perspective, it gives us no unit of item1\u2014even though item1 is very valuable to us (94 per unit) and there are 2 units available. We believe that, if we can reallocate item1 from Player 2 to ourselves (and compensate Player 2 fairly on other items), we can improve our overall payoff.\n\n4. We propose a counteroffer in round 2. Remember that when we submit a counteroffer, we specify the number of units that Player 2 would get; our share is then the remainder of each item. For example, if we offer Player 2 an allocation for item1 lower than 2, then we get the leftovers (which improves our payoff given the high value we assign to item1).\n\n5. One reasonable counteroffer is to allocate to Player 2 as follows:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item1: 0 (instead of 2 in the current offer, so we take full control of item1),\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item2: 2 (the current offer already gave Player 2 none of item2; giving them all 2 might help \u201cbalance\u201d the deal),\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item3: 2 (keeping as before),\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item4: 1 (a slight concession even though in the current offer Player 2 would have gotten 0 \u2013 note that item4 is low value for us),\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item5: 4 (the same as before).\nThis counteroffer gives Player 2 the bundle [0, 2, 2, 1, 4]. Then our share becomes the remainder:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item1: 2 \u2013 0 = 2,\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item2: 2 \u2013 2 = 0,\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item3: 3 \u2013 2 = 1,\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item4: 3 \u2013 1 = 2,\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item5: 7 \u2013 4 = 3.\nOur payoff from this allocation is:\n\u2003\u20032\u00d794 + 0\u00d730 + 1\u00d756 + 2\u00d728 + 3\u00d791 = 188 + 0 + 56 + 56 + 273 = 573.\nIf this deal were struck in round 3 it would be discounted by \u03b3^(3\u20131) = 0.98\u00b2 \u2248 0.9604, giving an effective value of 573 \u00d7 0.9604 \u2248 550.\nThis is an improvement over the 524.48 we\u2019d get by accepting the current offer, and\u2014given that the numbers we offer to Player 2 (especially on items 2, 3, 4, and 5) are roughly \u201cin expectation\u201d balanced (when their values are drawn uniformly) compared to what they got before\u2014the counteroffer is competitive.\n\n6. Considering we risk a lower payoff if negotiations falter but our current deal is good relative to our fallback (393), we feel that a moderate counteroffer that improves our share of high\u2010value item1 is a sensible next move.\n\nTherefore, our chosen action is to counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 2, 1, 4]}",

                    "response": "I\u2019ve carefully evaluated the situation. Here\u2019s a summary of the reasoning:\n\n1. My private per\u2010unit values are very \u201cskewed:\u201d I really prize item\u202f1 (91 per unit) and item\u202f4 (73 per unit), while the other items are much lower. However, the total available in item\u202f1 is only 2 units. In the past rounds Player\u202f1\u2019s offers have always kept all the item\u202f1 units for themselves. (For example, in Round\u202f1 my offer [0,2,2,0,4] left Player\u202f1 with 2 units of item\u202f1 and in the current offer I would get none.)\n\n2. The current offer on the table (which gives me [0,2,2,1,4]) would give me raw utility calculated as:\n\u2003\u2003item\u202f1: 0\u202f\u00d7\u202f91 = 0  \n\u2003\u2003item\u202f2: 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f7 = 14  \n\u2003\u2003item\u202f3: 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f13 = 26  \n\u2003\u2003item\u202f4: 1\u202f\u00d7\u202f73 = 73  \n\u2003\u2003item\u202f5: 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f9 = 36  \n\u2003\u2003Total = 0 + 14 + 26 + 73 + 36 = 149.\nWhen we apply the round-2 discount factor (\u03b3^(2\u20131) = 0.98) this is 149\u00d70.98 \u2248 146.02.\n\n3. By contrast, my private outside offer is worth 367 (and when walking I get that full amount with no discount). Thus, accepting the current offer would be far worse for me.\n\n4. In contemplating a counteroffer I considered that to beat my fallback of 367 (even before discounting) I would need to secure a raw utility of roughly 367/0.98 \u2248 375+ (in round 2) \u2013 and even more if we reached round 3 (with an even lower multiplier). In my \u201cpie\u201d the maximum I could get would be if I claimed nearly everything \u2013 yet if I did that, Player\u202f1 would get almost nothing and would surely refuse any deal (given that in previous rounds they consistently kept key items such as both units of item\u202f1).\n\n5. In short, there is no realistic division I could propose in Round\u202f2 that (a) would improve my own take above what I\u2019d get by walking away, and (b) is likely to be acceptable to Player\u202f1. The current offer gives me a very low value and any counteroffer trying to push for a better share would probably be rejected (and if it reaches Round\u202f3 the discount hurts even more).\n\nFor these reasons the best action is to WALK away and secure the outside offer which is much higher than any negotiated deal I can expect in these rounds.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

My private \u201coutside offer\u201d is 1041. This means that if negotiations break down, I get 1041\u2014almost 92% of my maximum possible value.\n3. In any negotiated agreement the outcome is \u201cdiscounted\u201d by a factor of \u03b3^(r\u20131) (with \u03b3 = 0.98) where r is the round number (here round 1 gives full value). Thus, to get a deal in round 1 I must secure an agreement worth at least my outside offer (1041) in my own valuation.\n4. Because my total is 1130, in any deal I must effectively \u201cgive up\u201d at most 1130 \u2013 1041 = 89 points (in my private value measure) to Player 2.\n5. In formulating an offer, I would have to hand over some of the items to P2 such that his allotment (based on his private values, which are unknown to me but drawn uniformly from 1 to 101) is attractive enough compared to his own outside offer. In most typical cases\u2014with his total potential value likely being higher than mine\u2014P2\u2019s reservation (or outside offer) would be on the order of roughly half his total potential value (often well above 89 when measured in comparable \u201cpoints\u201d). Thus, trying to \u201cbuy his agreement\u201d by giving him no more than an 89\u2010value concession (from my perspective) would likely be far too stingy for him.\n6. Since any division that leaves me with at least 1041 (and thus sacrificing at most 89 points from my total) is very unfavorable for P2, the prospect of reaching a deal that makes both sides better is slim.\n7. Given that my \u201cdisagreement\u201d payoff (1041) is extremely attractive relative to what I could get in any negotiated deal (because any acceptable deal would force me to concede too much), the best risk\u2010averse move is to secure my outside offer immediately.\n  \nThus, as Player 1 in round 1, my optimal action is to WALK away.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

My total full value (if I got all items) is\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 2\u00d731 = 62  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 3\u00d784 = 252  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 6\u00d755 = 330  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 3\u00d78 = 24  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 3\u00d722 = 66  \n\u2003\u2003Total = 734.\n\u2003My fallback is 499, so any accepted deal must give me more than that\u2014even after I concede items.\n\n2. I want to keep most of the high\u2010value items (especially items 2 and 3) for myself. Taking all of item 2 (3\u00d784 =252) and almost all of item 3 (6\u00d755 =330) would already yield a high amount. However, if I \u201ckeep everything\u201d from those types, my opponent\u2019s deal might fall short of what they expect relative to their private outside offer.\n\n3. Since Player\u202f2\u2019s private values are unknown, I try to design an offer that gives them enough \u201ctreat\u201d items so that their expected value (given roughly average unit values of about 51 from a uniform distribution over [1,101]) is competitive with their outside offer. For items where my value is lower or items that I care less about (like items 1, 4, and 5), I can concede more.\n\n4. One idea was to let Player\u202f2 have all of items 1, 4, and 5. That would give them:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 1: 2 units \u2248 2\u00d751 =102  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 4: 3 units \u2248 3\u00d751 =153  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 5: 3 units \u2248 3\u00d751 =153  \n\u2003\u2003Total expected \u2248408.\n\u2003But this might be too low compared with their outside offer\u2019s expected value (their total items\u2019 value is about 867, so their outside offer could average near 434). So I need to boost their share a bit.\n\n5. I then considered conceding an extra unit of one of the high\u2010value items to increase their share. Conceding one unit of item 3 (worth 55 to me) is less damaging than giving up one of item 2 since 55 is less than 84. With that concession, the offer to Player\u202f2 becomes:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 2 units of item\u202f1 (all of it)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 0 units of item\u202f2 (I keep all 3)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 1 unit of item\u202f3 (so I get 5 units remaining)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 All of item\u202f4 (3 units)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 All of item\u202f5 (3 units)\n\u2003\n6. With this offer, my share is:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 1: 0 units  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 2: 3 units \u2192 3\u00d784 = 252  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 3: 5 units \u2192 5\u00d755 = 275  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Items 4 and 5: 0 units  \n\u2003\u2003Total = 252+275 = 527, which safely beats 499.\n\u2003\n7. Meanwhile, Player\u202f2\u2019s offer is:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 1: 2 units  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 3: 1 unit  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 4: 3 units  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 5: 3 units  \n\u2003\u2003Expected value (using an approximate average of 51 per unit) = 2\u00d751 + 1\u00d751 + 3\u00d751 + 3\u00d751 = 459, which is reasonably above their likely fallback.\n\nThis strikes a balance between my desire to keep the very valuable items (items 2 and 3) and making the offer palatable to Player\u202f2 so that they receive an expected amount competitive with their outside offer.\n\nThus, my action as Player 1 in round 1 is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 1, 3, 3]}",

In addition, our outside offer is 176, which is much lower.\n\nStep 2: Consider whether we might improve our outcome further. Notice that the current offer gives us nothing of item 2 even though we highly value it (60 per unit). Knowing that player 1\u2019s private values are unknown (drawn uniformly from 1 to 101) and that \u2013 on average \u2013 item 2 may be less important to them, we see an opportunity. By asking for 1 unit of item 2 from player 1 (and correspondingly reducing their share), our bundle would become even more attractive to us.\n\nStep 3: Check feasibility of a counteroffer. Total available items are:\n\u2003item 1: 2,\u2003item 2: 3,\u2003item 3: 6,\u2003item 4: 3,\u2003item 5: 3.\nIf we propose to receive [2, 1, 1, 3, 3], then player 1 gets:\n\u2003item 1: 0,\u2003item 2: 2,\u2003item 3: 5,\u2003item 4: 0,\u2003item 5: 0.\nOur new value becomes:\n\u20032\u00d710 + 1\u00d760 + 1\u00d750 + 3\u00d746 + 3\u00d731 = 20 + 60 + 50 + 138 + 93 = 361.\nThus, by asking for an extra unit of item 2 we gain an extra 60 in value while still offering player 1 a (presumably acceptable) remainder of the items.\n\nStep 4: Weighing potential risks \u2013 if we counteroffer and player 1 rejects, the negotiation goes to later rounds and discounting will reduce the available surplus. Since our current sure\u2010thing is 301 in round 1, it makes sense to slightly improve our deal. Our requested counteroffer [2,1,1,3,3] is valid given the total amounts and it gives us a noticeable improvement while only moderately reducing player 1\u2019s allocation (and likely their payoff).\n\nStep 5: Conclude. Given that our current offer gives us 301 (well above our fallback of 176) but we notice an opportunity (high value item2) to do even better, our risk\u2010aware and value\u2010improving move is to propose a counteroffer.\n\nMy action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 1, 3, 3]}",

Thus, accepting the current offer would be far below your fallback.\n\n2. As the offerer in round 2, you can propose a different division. Recall that an offer is made as a list indicating \u201cwhat you give to Player\u00a02\u201d and you get the remaining items. In round\u00a01 you offered [2, 0, 1, 3, 3] to Player\u00a02; then Player\u00a02\u2019s counteroffer was [2, 1, 1, 3, 3] (giving you that bundle). Notice that in your round\u20111 offer you were \u201ctrading\u201d your item2 for some of the other items. Given your private values, you have a strong comparative advantage in item2 (you value a unit at 84 while an opponent with a uniform draw might expect roughly 51 on average). On the other hand, for items 1, 4, and 5 your values (31, 8, 22 respectively) are relatively low compared to the likely opponent\u2019s value (around 51 on average). \n\n3. A potentially attractive counteroffer is to \u201cclaim\u201d item2 entirely for yourself (thus boosting your own payoff) while giving Player\u00a02 the items where you have a relative disadvantage. For example, if you offer Player\u00a02 the bundle [2, 0, 1, 3, 3] (i.e. the same as your round\u20111 offer), then the division is as follows:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Player\u00a02 would get:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 item1: 2 units,\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 item2: 0 units,\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 item3: 1 unit,\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 item4: 3 units,\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 item5: 3 units.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 You would get the remainder:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 item1: 0 (since 2 of 2 go to Player\u00a02)\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 item2: all 3,\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 item3: 5 (since 6\u20131 = 5),\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 item4: 0,\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 item5: 0.\nYour raw value from your bundle is:\n\u2003\u2003Item2: 3\u00d784 = 252  \n\u2003\u2003Item3: 5\u00d755 = 275  \n\u2003\u2003Total = 527.\nDiscounting this by \u03b3 = 0.98 gives a present value of about 527\u00d70.98 = 516.46, which is clearly above your outside offer of 499.\n\n4. Now compare what Player\u00a02 gets in this proposal. Under the current offer on the table (the counteroffer from Player\u00a02) you would get [2,1,1,3,3] and Player\u00a02 would receive the remainder:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 For example, in that deal, Player\u00a02\u2019s bundle would be:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 item1: (total 2) \u2013 2 = 0  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 item2: 3 \u2013 1 = 2  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 item3: 6 \u2013 1 = 5  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 item4: 3 \u2013 3 = 0  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 item5: 3 \u2013 3 = 0.  \nSo his raw value (based on his likely average per\u2010unit value ~51) would be roughly 2\u00d751 + 5\u00d751 = 102 + 255 = 357.\nIn your counteroffer, however, Player\u00a02 would get:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 item1: 2 units (~102 in raw value),\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 item3: 1 unit (~51),\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 item4: 3 units (~153),\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 item5: 3 units (~153),\nTotaling roughly 102+51+153+153 = 459.\nAfter discounting, that becomes about 459\u00d70.98 \u2248 450.8.\nThus, compared to his current proposal (which would yield him less), this counteroffer gives Player\u00a02 a noticeably better deal. (Of course his exact private values are unknown, but giving him more of the \u201cgood\u201d items from his perspective\u2014those where he has a relative advantage\u2014should help make the deal acceptable.)\n\n5. Therefore, by proposing the division where you offer Player\u00a02 the bundle [2, 0, 1, 3, 3] (keeping all of item2 and 5 units of item3 for yourself), you raise your outcome well above your outside option while also giving Player\u00a02 a bundle that seems improved relative to his own previous proposal.\n\nBased on this reasoning, my action is to propose that counteroffer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 1, 3, 3]}",

(For comparison, my outside option is 176, so this deal is far superior.)\n\nI did previously offer [2,1,1,3,3] (which would have given me more of item 2, my highest\u2010valued item) but Player 1\u2019s repeated offer ([2,0,1,3,3]) suggests that they prefer to hold their ground on item 2 and are not inclined to give it up. Pushing too hard now could risk delaying the agreement\u2014which, given the discounting\u2014and possibly lead to a final round where I might be forced to accept a worse outcome or even trigger a walk away action on my part.\n\nBalancing the good utility from the current offer, the relatively small discount (\u03b3=0.98), and the risk that counter\u2010offering might not bring Player 1 to compromise on item 2, the best course of action is to secure the deal now.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

                    "response": "I'll explain my thought process.\n\nMy overall aim is to \u201canchor\u201d an offer in round\u202f1 that (a) gives me at least as much value as my disagreement (my outside offer is 845; note that if the deal is made immediately there is no discount, so I must do at least as well as 845) and (b) \u201coffers\u201d the other side a bit more than what they might get if they walked away. (Player\u202f2\u2019s outside offer is private and drawn uniformly from 1 up to their full\u2010value of items; based on averages the total value for all items \u201cfrom their eyes\u201d might be around 5\u00d751+1\u00d751+3\u00d751+6\u00d751+4\u00d751 \u2248969 so on average their outside \u201coffer\u201d (or reservation) is around 1/2 of that \u2013 roughly 480\u2013490 \u2013 although they could be lower.) \n\nTo calculate my maximum \u201cconcession\u201d I note the total value (according to my private values) of all items is 1125. Thus if I were to get everything I\u2019d have 1125; since my outside offer is 845 I must \u201cearn\u201d at least 845 in the deal. That means from the full 1125 I have at most a \u201closs\u201d (or concession) of 1125 \u2013 845 = 280 in my item\u2010value. \n\nI notice that for item types 1 and 5 my own per\u2010unit value is only 37 whereas (given player 2\u2019s likely range) an average unit for them is about 51. (In contrast the units of item types 2, 3, and 4 have values 72, 64, and 88 for me so they are \u201cprecious\u201d to me.) Thus, if I want to give up some \u201cleverage\u201d but hurt myself minimally (while trying to \u201cincentivize\u201d an immediate agreement) I should concede only along the \u201ccheap\u201d dimensions: items 1 and 5.\n\nI cannot \u201cgive\u201d too many such units or I will drop below 845 for myself. In fact, if I give away m units of items whose worth to me is 37 each, I lose 37\u00b7m in my own total. I need 37\u00b7m \u2264 280 so that m can be at most 7 (since 8\u00d737 = 296 > 280). One \u201cnice\u201d offer is then to let Player\u202f2 have 7 \u201cunits\u201d from these cheap items. One natural split is to give them all 5 units of item 1 (5\u00d737 = 185 loss to me) and 2 units of item 5 (2\u00d737 = 74 loss) so that the total loss is 259 \u2013 leaving me with 1125 \u2013 259 = 866, above my disagreement value of 845. \n\nFrom Player\u202f2\u2019s (expected) perspective the \u201clot\u201d we offer along these items is worth roughly 7\u00d751 = 357; admittedly, this is lower than an average outside offer (~480) but since their exact outside offer is unknown (and could be low) this is our initial \u201canchor.\u201d (If they counter, we will have further rounds to negotiate but any counteroffer by them will risk additional discounting.) \n\nBased on this reasoning, my initial offer (as Player\u202f1 in round 1) is to \u201cgive\u201d Player\u202f2:\n\u2003\u2022 all 5 units of item 1,\n\u2003\u2022 0 units of item 2,\n\u2003\u2022 0 units of item 3,\n\u2003\u2022 0 units of item 4,\n\u2003\u2022 2 units of item 5.\n\nThus my offer is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [5, 0, 0, 0, 2]}",

                    "response": "Step\u2010by\u2010step reasoning (this is my private analysis):\n\n1. My private values for the items are:\n\u2003 \u2022 Item 1: 37 per unit (5 available)\n\u2003 \u2022 Item 2: 72 per unit (1 available)\n\u2003 \u2022 Item 3: 64 per unit (3 available)\n\u2003 \u2022 Item 4: 88 per unit (6 available)\n\u2003 \u2022 Item 5: 37 per unit (4 available)\n\u2003 so if I got everything my total value would be 1125.\n\n2. My outside offer is 845. In round 2 the discount factor is \u03b3^(2\u20131)=0.98 so if I \u201cwalk\u201d I get effectively 845\u00d70.98\u2248828.1 in present\u2010value terms.\n\n3. The current offer on the table (from Player 2) is that I would receive:\n\u2003 [2, 0, 0, 1, 2].\n\u2003 Calculating my raw value for that:\n\u2003 \u2022 Item 1: 2\u00d737 = 74\n\u2003 \u2022 Item 2: 0\u00d772 = 0\n\u2003 \u2022 Item 3: 0\u00d764 = 0\n\u2003 \u2022 Item 4: 1\u00d788 = 88\n\u2003 \u2022 Item 5: 2\u00d737 = 74\n\u2003 Total = 74+0+0+88+74 = 236.\n\u2003 After discounting by 0.98 the value is about 231.3\u2014which is far inferior to my fallback of \u2248828.1.\n\n4. So I do not want to ACCEPT the current offer and it does not make sense to WALK away either because I have room to \u201cclaim\u201d more value provided I can trade off giving Player 2 just enough to get them to agree (their acceptance threshold is likely around the value they could secure with their own outside offer).\n\n5. In crafting a counteroffer, I (as Player 1) choose the numbers to indicate what I propose to give Player 2. (Remember: any items not \u201cgiven\u201d in the offer I keep.) My aim is to secure myself nearly all the high\u2010value items while offering minimal concessions on the items that are less \u201cprecious\u201d to me.\n\n6. My analysis shows that if I could secure almost all items I get a very high total (for example, if I offer very little to Player 2, I\u2019d keep nearly all items worth nearly 1125). But I must offer Player 2 a share that is at least marginally attractive compared to waiting (with discounting) or their own outside offer. Given my low value on item 1 and item 5 (37 each) I can use them as \u201cconcession\u201d items while holding onto items 2, 3, and 4 (which for me yield higher marginal benefits, especially item 4 at 88 per unit).\n\n7. A candidate counteroffer is to give Player 2 only 1 unit of item 1 and 1 unit of item 5 (and nothing from the other items). In that case:\n\u2003 \u2013 My allocation becomes: \n\u2003\u2003 Item 1: 5 \u2013 1 = 4 units\u2003 (4\u00d737 = 148)\n\u2003\u2003 Item 2: 1 \u2013 0 = 1 unit\u2003\u2003 (1\u00d772 = 72)\n\u2003\u2003 Item 3: 3 \u2013 0 = 3 units\u2003 (3\u00d764 = 192)\n\u2003\u2003 Item 4: 6 \u2013 0 = 6 units\u2003 (6\u00d788 = 528)\n\u2003\u2003 Item 5: 4 \u2013 1 = 3 units\u2003 (3\u00d737 = 111)\n\u2003\u2003 Total raw value = 148+72+192+528+111 = 1051.\n\u2003 \u2013 Discounted to round 2 value: 1051\u00d70.98 \u2248 1029.\n\u2003 \u2013 This is clearly better for me than the outside offer (~828).\n\n8. Although this counteroffer gives Player 2 a seemingly \u201csmall\u201d bundle (only 1 unit each of items 1 and 5), it is structured so that I keep nearly everything. (Choosing items with the lowest unit value for me minimizes the \u201ccost\u201d of making a concession.) In negotiations the proposer typically pushes for a favorable division while offering just enough to tip the balance in the other\u2019s favor relative to their outside option. Given that Player 2 already proposed a deal that would have given me only 236 and secured a much higher share for themselves \u2013 a division likely far above what I\u2019d be willing to accept \u2013 I deduce that giving them a modest but nonzero concession may entice them to settle.\n\n9. Thus, I choose to make a counteroffer giving Player 2 1 unit of item 1 and 1 unit of item 5. This is my proposed offer \u2013 expecting that Player 2\u2019s private values (and outside offer) may make it acceptable.\n\nBased on the above, my move in Round 2 is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]}",

Evaluating that with my private per\u2010unit values (21, 31, 8, 23, 31), my gross \u201cdeal\u2010value\u201d would be \n\u2003\u20032\u00d721 + 1\u00d731 + 1\u00d78 + 0\u00d723 + 0\u00d731 = 42 + 31 + 8 = 81.\nSince we are in round 2 the discount factor \u03b3 = 0.98 applies (value \u00d7 0.98), so the present value of that deal would be 81\u00d70.98 \u2248 79.4. \n\n\u2022 However, my private outside offer guarantees me 132 (and if I walk I get that full 132, with no discounting). Thus, even on a discounted basis the current offer is far below what I can get by not reaching an agreement.\n\n\u2022 One might try to \u201ccounteroffer\u201d in order to get a better share than 81 gross (one that, with the round\u20102 discount, would exceed 132).

Crafting a counteroffer that allows me to keep nearly everything (so that my own gross value is well above 134.7) would require me to concede significantly on those items\u2014likely so much that Player\u202f2 would prefer to reject it and possibly wait for a round 3 counteroffer (or even simply walk away).\n\n\u2022 Given the structure (with only 3 rounds and further discounting if we delay) and my outside option of 132 being far better than the value from the current offer, any counteroffer I might try runs the risk of not being accepted by Player\u202f2. In other words, it appears that there is no \u201cwin\u2013win\u201d modification that would let me obtain a deal with a discounted value greater than 132 and still be acceptable for the other side.\n\nThus, since accepting gives me roughly 79 (discounted) and attempting a counteroffer is very likely to fail (forcing me eventually to get only my outside offer of 132, but then suffering discount if we delayed further), my best, rational action in round 2 is to WALK away and secure my outside guarantee.\n\nTherefore, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

                    "response": "[Reasoning]\nWe start by noting that if no deal is struck each player \u201cwalks\u2010away\u201d and gets their outside offer. My outside offer is 945 in my own value\u2010units. (My total full\u2010pie value is 1188.) That means that \u2013 from my own perspective \u2013 any agreement I accept must give me at least 945 in value (discounting isn\u2019t an issue in round 1). In other words I cannot afford to \u201cgive up\u201d more than 1188 \u2013 945 = 243 utility from what I\u2019d get by claiming everything. (This \u201csurplus\u201d is the part available to bargain over.)\n\nI would like to design an offer that awards me just enough so that I get at least 945 while \u201cconceding\u201d the rest (243 in my value\u2010units) to Player 2. However, what Player 2 sees is not my own numbers. His per\u2010unit values are drawn uniformly from the 1\u2013101 range (with expected value \u224851 per unit) so his \u201coutside offer\u201d will be somewhere between 1 and his full\u2010pie total (which on average is 816). Roughly speaking, if he got every unit he would \u201cexpect\u201d 816; his average reservation would be roughly \u00bd\u00d7816 \u2248408. (Of course, his actual private numbers are unknown to me.) \n\nSince our items are \u201cindivisible\u201d units and my units have different values to me, I try to \u201cspare\u201d myself the painful cost. Notice that my unit\u2010values are:\n \u2022 Item 1: 85\n \u2022 Item 2: 61\n \u2022 Item 3: 60 \n \u2022 Item 4: 88 \n \u2022 Item 5: 63\n\nIn terms of \u201closs\u201d by giving a unit away, I prefer to lose units whose value to me is low. (For example, giving up 1 unit of item 3 \u201ccosts\u201d me 60, whereas giving up one unit of item 4 \u201ccosts\u201d me 88.) In expectation, any unit given to Player 2 is \u201cworth\u201d about 51 (the average of a uniform distribution from 1 to 101). Thus if I \u201cconcede\u201d a unit, my \u201closs\u201d (the gap between my unit\u2010value and roughly 51 for Player 2) is approximately:\n \u2022 Item 1: 85 \u2013 51 = 34\n \u2022 Item 2: 61 \u2013 51 = 10\n \u2022 Item 3: 60 \u2013 51 = 9\n \u2022 Item 4: 88 \u2013 51 = 37\n \u2022 Item 5: 63 \u2013 51 = 12\n\nSo I would prefer to \u201cgive\u201d Player 2 the units of item 3 (lowest loss), then those of item 2, and finally item 5 if needed.\n\nA minimal \u201cown\u2010reservation\u201d allocation for me is to collect items that sum to 945 in my valuation. One possibility is to take nearly everything except a \u201csurplus\u201d that, in my own terms, totals 243. For instance, one set of numbers that sums exactly to 945 for me is as follows. (Recall that the full available units are: 3 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 5 of item 4, and 3 of item 5.)\n\nIf I \u201ckeep\u201d: \n \u2022 All 3 units of item 1: 3\u00d785 = 255 \n \u2022 All 5 units of item 4: 5\u00d788 = 440 \n \u2022 All 3 units of item 5: 3\u00d763 = 189 \n \u2022 1 unit of item 2: 1\u00d761 = 61 \nthen my total = 255 + 440 + 189 + 61 = 945 exactly.\n\nThat means I \u201cconcede\u201d the remaining units:\n \u2022 From item 2: 4 \u2013 1 = 3 units  \n \u2022 From item 3: all 1 unit  \n \u2022 And nothing from items 1, 4, or 5.\n\nIn my own valuation, I am \u201cgiving up\u201d an amount of 3\u00d761 + 1\u00d760 = 183 + 60 = 243 utility. (This is exactly the \u201cextra\u201d above my reservation inherent in the full pie \u2013 1188 \u2013 945 = 243.)\n\nNow, even though from my view those 4 units are \u201cworth\u201d 243 total, Player 2\u2019s private values are unknown. However, if his \u201cper\u2010unit\u201d values are near the mean (about 51), then these 4 units would (on average) be worth roughly 4\u00d751 = 204. That might be lower than his own outside offer if he drew a high number; but as my initial offer I am forced to \u201cprotect\u201d myself by guaranteeing myself at least what I could get by walking away, while hoping that Player 2\u2019s outside offer was low. (If Player 2 ends up with a high private value then he may well counter\u2010offer rather than accept.)\n\nGiven that this is round 1 and I must propose an initial action in the required format (either WALK or offer a list of numbers representing the units I give to Player 2), my proposal is to \u201coffer\u201d the division described above. That is, I propose that Player 2 gets:\n \u2022 0 units of item 1 \n \u2022 3 units of item 2 \n \u2022 1 unit of item 3 \n \u2022 0 units of item 4 \n \u2022 0 units of item 5\n\nThus, my own allocation becomes the complement:\n \u2022 Item 1: all 3 units \n \u2022 Item 2: 1 unit \n \u2022 Item 3: 0 units \n \u2022 Item 4: all 5 units \n \u2022 Item 5: all 3 units\nyielding exactly 945 in my value. \n\nWhile this aggressive initial offer gives Player 2 an expected total around 204 (if his per\u2010unit expected value is around 51), I must hope that his private draw (and his outside offer) is sufficiently low or that strategic considerations (including the discount factor as rounds pass) induce him to accept.\n\nThus, my action in round 1 is to offer Player 2 the following division: [0, 3, 1, 0, 0].\n\nFinal action in required JSON format is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 1, 0, 0]}",

                    "response": "I\u2019ll explain my reasoning briefly before giving my move. My goal as Player\u00a01 is to get a deal that is better for me (more than my outside offer of 86) while giving Player\u00a02 enough on the items that I don\u2019t care as much about so that they have an incentive to accept rather than risk later rounds (with discounting) or their own outside offer. I know my private per\u2010unit values:\n\u2003\u2022 Item\u00a01:\u20037\n\u2003\u2022 Item\u00a02:\u200343\n\u2003\u2022 Item\u00a03:\u20031\n\u2003\u2022 Item\u00a04:\u200369\n\u2003\u2022 Item\u00a05:\u200310\nand the available quantities are 3, 2, 3, 5, and 3 respectively (total potential value 485 for me). \nBecause I value items 2 and 4 a lot (43 and 69 per unit) I\u2019d like to keep most of those. In contrast, items 1 and 3 have a low personal payoff (7 and 1 per unit) so I am willing to concede them entirely to Player\u00a02 (even though they might get good value out of them). Item 5 is worth only 10 per unit for me, so I give up most\u2014but not necessarily all\u2014of it.\nA reasonable initial offer that balances these considerations is to offer Player\u00a02 all of the low\u2010value items (all 3 units of item\u00a01 and all 3 units of item\u00a03), and to share the items I value more less generously. For the higher\u2010value items I propose giving Player\u00a02 one of the two available units of item\u00a02 (so I keep 1 unit) and only 2 of the 5 units of item\u00a04 (so I keep 3 units). Finally, on item\u00a05 I offer Player\u00a02 1 unit (keeping 2 for myself). \n\nLet\u2019s check my payoff in this division:\n\u2003\u2022 Item\u00a01: I keep 0, value = 0.\n\u2003\u2022 Item\u00a02: I keep 1 unit \u2192 1 \u00d7 43 = 43.\n\u2003\u2022 Item\u00a03: I keep 0, value = 0.\n\u2003\u2022 Item\u00a04: I keep 3 units \u2192 3 \u00d7 69 = 207.\n\u2003\u2022 Item\u00a05: I keep 2 units \u2192 2 \u00d7 10 = 20.\nTotal for me: 43 + 207 + 20 = 270, well above my outside offer of 86.\n\nPlayer\u00a02\u2019s actual values are unknown (drawn uniformly from 1 to 101) but by giving them all of items 1 and 3 plus a decent share of the others the offer should be attractive\u2014especially since we are in the first round and there is no discounting yet.\n\nThus, my chosen move is to announce this initial offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 1, 3, 2, 1]}",

                    "response": "Step 1. First, let\u2019s review the situation. There are 5 types of items with the following available quantities:\n\u2003\u2022 Item1: 5 units\n\u2003\u2022 Item2: 1 unit\n\u2003\u2022 Item3: 4 units\n\u2003\u2022 Item4: 7 units\n\u2003\u2022 Item5: 3 units\n\nMy private per\u2010unit values are:\n\u2003\u2022 Item1: 35\u2003\u2003(Item total if I got them all: 175)\n\u2003\u2022 Item2: 29\u2003\u2003(29)\n\u2003\u2022 Item3: 68\u2003\u2003(272)\n\u2003\u2022 Item4: 85\u2003\u2003(595)\n\u2003\u2022 Item5: 95\u2003\u2003(285)\nFor a total (if I got everything) of 1356. My outside option guarantees 461.\n\nStep 2. We assume that Player 2\u2019s private values are drawn uniformly between 1 and 101 (so an \u201caverage\u201d unit value might be roughly 51). Hence if Player 2 got all items they might \u201cin expectation\u201d value the items at around 20\u00d751 = 1020, and so their outside offer (drawn uniformly on [1, total value]) might average around 510. In a negotiation each agent will tend to require at least what their outside alternative (or \u201ccontinuation value\u201d) is worth.  \n\nStep 3. I also consider that my own items have different \u201crelative advantages.\u201d For me:\n\u2003\u2013 Items 3, 4, and 5 are ones where my value per unit (68, 85, 95 respectively) is higher than the opponent\u2019s average estimate of about 51.\n\u2003\u2013 Items 1 and 2 are ones where my values (35 and 29) are lower than the average expected 51 for Player 2.\nRather than giving up surplus on items that I value greatly (items 3,4,5), I would like to \u201cconcede\u201d on the items that I value relatively less (items 1 and 2) and then, if necessary, some from the others to just meet Player 2\u2019s minimum expected value.\n\nStep 4. A \u201cfair\u201d split (in Player 2\u2019s expected view) might be one in which he gets roughly 510 in \u201cexpected value.\u201d Allocating him all of items 1 and 2 would give him:\n\u2003\u2022 Item1: 5 units \u2192 expected ~5\u00d751 = 255\n\u2003\u2022 Item2: 1 unit \u2192 ~51\nFor a subtotal of about 306; that\u2019s too low compared with a likely outside value around 510. I need to add roughly 204 more \u201cpoints\u201d in expected value.  \nNow, how do I add value cheaply?  \n\u2013 Conceding units from items that I value much more than the average (like items 3,4,5) costs me relatively high.  \n\u2013 A unit given from item5, for example, costs me 95 points but \u201cgains\u201d (from Player 2\u2019s perspective) an expected 51. Even though that is a cost, compared to items 3 and 4 (with my values 68 and 85) the trade\u2010off is a bit less penalizing on my side (95 is high absolutely but the ratio of my cost to his gain is lower when I already have a strong margin, see below).  \nLet\u2019s consider giving him all the units of item5. That adds:\n\u2003\u2022 Item5: 3 units \u2192 expected 3\u00d751 = 153.\nNow his total is 306 + 153 = 459, still roughly 51 short of the 510 ballpark.  \nI can add one unit from item4 to supply roughly an extra 51 in his expected value:\n\u2003\u2022 Item4: 1 unit \u2192 expected 51.\nThat brings his \u201cpackage\u201d to 306 + 153 + 51 = 510 in expected value.\n\nStep 5. Summarizing, I propose to give Player 2:\n\u2003Item1: all 5 units  \n\u2003Item2: the 1 unit  \n\u2003Item4: 1 unit  \n\u2003Item5: all 3 units  \nAnd I keep:\n\u2003Item3: all 4 units  \n\u2003Item4: the remaining (7 \u2013 1 = 6) units\n\nStep 6. Let\u2019s check our payoff:\n\u2022 For me, my value would be:\n\u2003\u2013 Item3: 4\u00d768 = 272  \n\u2003\u2013 Item4: 6\u00d785 = 510  \nTotal = 782, which is well above my outside offer of 461.\n\u2022 For Player 2, if his valuations are near the expected average of \u224851 per unit, he secures about 510 in value\u2014roughly matching what he might expect from waiting.\nThus, this initial offer makes economic sense and gives Player 2 just enough incentive to accept.\n\nStep 7. Now, since we are in round 1 and I must choose my initial offer as a list of the quantities I give to Player 2, I will propose the counteroffer as:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [5, 1, 0, 1, 3]}",

                    "response": "I'll explain my reasoning briefly.\n\nMy total value if I got everything would be 454. (For example, item\u20101: 2\u00d721, item\u20102: 4\u00d76, item\u20103: 3\u00d756, item\u20104: 9\u00d715, item\u20105: 5\u00d717 add up to 454.) My private outside option is 438, so if no deal is reached I get 438. That means that any deal I agree to must give me more than 438. In a one\u2010round (or early\u2010round) deal the discount factor is 1, so I must do at least about as well as my fallback.\n\nBecause I value most items very highly (my \u201cpie\u201d is only worth 454) I can afford to concede at most a very small amount \u2013 on the order of 16 points from 454. (Conceding more would leave me with less than my fallback of 438.) Looking at my unit values, even conceding one unit of my \u201ccheapest\u201d item (item 2, which is worth 6 for me) would cost me 6 points, and I could perhaps concede two units (12 points) to get even 2 units\u2019 worth of share for Player\u00a02. However, Player\u00a02\u2019s private values (drawn uniformly from 1 to 101) are likely to be around 51 per unit on average, so even 2 units give him an expected 102 worth in his own terms. That is far below what his outside offer is likely to be (since his total value if he got everything would be roughly 23\u00d751 \u2243 1173, so his outside offer averages about 586).\n\nThus, any offer I could \u201cimprove\u201d over my fallback (438) would require me to give Player\u00a02 so much (because he has an excellent fallback too) that my own share would drop below 438. In round 1 the deal is not discounted yet, so waiting or going back and forth can only hurt me. I cannot craft any division of the items that gives me more than 438 and at the same time gives Player\u00a02 at least his expected fallback value (roughly 586 or so, in his own terms). \n\nUnder these circumstances the only \u201crational\u201d move for me is to avoid any delay that would force me to ultimately get less than 438. (Any counteroffer that gives him any positive allocation would force me to sacrifice enough value \u2013 from my pie of 454 \u2013 so that I\u2019d get less than my fallback.) \n\nSo my best action in round 1 is simply to WALK away and secure my outside offer of 438 rather than risk a drawn\u2010out negotiation that would only force discounting or require me to concede too much.\n\nTherefore, my action is: \n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

                    "response": "I want to design an offer that gives me a deal that is better than my outside option (281 in my own terms) while trying to provide Player\u00a02 with a share that looks attractive given what we expect about their numbers. (Recall that my total value for the full bundle is 687, so if I got everything I would \u201cget\u201d 687; my reservation is 281.) I also note that although I know my own unit\u2010values (13, 32, 90, 13, and 99 for items 1\u20135 respectively) the other player\u2019s unit\u2010values are unknown, though they come from the same uniform distribution (roughly averaging around 51 per unit). (For example, given a full bundle of 4,4,3,3,2 units it would have an expected total value of roughly 16\u00d751\u2248816. Hence the outside offer Player\u00a02 might have is drawn from 1 up to that total, with an average around 408.) \n\nBecause I make the first offer I can \u201cset the frame\u201d by stating what I propose to give Player\u00a02; what remains for me is the difference (per item) from the total available. In thinking about possible item\u2010divisions I want to meet two conditions:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Ensure that my own bundle\u2019s value (computed with my private per\u2011unit values) is above my outside offer of 281.\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Ensure that the offer for Player\u00a02 seems \u201cfair\u201d or attractive enough that \u2013 even if P2\u2019s true numbers differ \u2013 the offer in expectation is competitive with what they might get outside (roughly speaking, I want to offer them a value around or a bit above 408 if I scale by the approximate average per\u2011unit value of 51, since that is what one might expect for the full bundle).\n\nOne candidate split is a \u201crough 50\u201350\u201d of the total value. For instance, if I were to simply \u201ccut the bundle in half\u201d by giving half the units of each item to Player\u00a02 I\u2019d propose something like:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a01: offer 2 units (so I keep 2 of the 4),\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a02: offer 2 units (keeping 2),\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a03: offer 1 unit (keeping 2 of 3),\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a04: offer 1 unit (keeping 2 of 3),\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a05: offer 1 unit (keeping 1 of 2).\n\nUnder that division my own value would be:\n\u2003Item 1: 2\u00d713 = 26\u2003\n\u2003Item 2: 2\u00d732 = 64\u2003\n\u2003Item 3: 2\u00d790 = 180\u2003\n\u2003Item 4: 2\u00d713 = 26\u2003\n\u2003Item 5: 1\u00d799 = 99\n\u2003\u2003Total = 26+64+180+26+99 = 395.\nAnd from my perspective the \u201coffer value\u201d to Player\u00a02 (using my numbers) would be:\n\u2003Item 1: 2\u00d713 = 26\u2003\n\u2003Item 2: 2\u00d732 = 64\u2003\n\u2003Item 3: 1\u00d790 = 90\u2003\n\u2003Item 4: 1\u00d713 = 13\u2003\n\u2003Item 5: 1\u00d799 = 99\n\u2003\u2003Total = 26+64+90+13+99 = 292.\nIf we assumed P2\u2019s items were, on average, valued around 51 each, then giving them 8 units total (2+2+1+1+1 = 7 units in this candidate would be too low), their expected \u201cvalue\u201d might run low relative to what they could get outside. \n\nI want to \u201cshift\u201d the deal slightly in P2\u2019s favor on the items that I personally do not value very highly. I note that my lowest per\u2011unit values are for items 1 and 4 (both only 13). So I can offer extra of these \u201clow\u2010value\u201d items without hurting my own payoff very much but making the offer more attractive from a Pareto perspective. One division that does that is as follows:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 1 (4 units total): offer 2 to P2 (so I keep 2),\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 2 (4 total): offer 2 to P2 (I keep 2),\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 3 (3 total): offer 1 to P2 (I keep 2),\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 4 (3 total): offer 1 to P2 (I keep 2),\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 5 (2 total): offer 2 to P2 (I keep 0).\n\nThen my own share comes out to:\n\u2003Item 1: 2\u00d713 = 26\u2003\n\u2003Item 2: 2\u00d732 = 64\u2003\n\u2003Item 3: 2\u00d790 = 180\u2003\n\u2003Item 4: 2\u00d713 = 26\u2003\n\u2003Item 5: 0\u00d799 = 0\n\u2003Total = 26+64+180+26 = 296.\nThat is just nicely above my reservation of 281.\nFrom my perspective the offer to Player\u00a02 is:\n\u2003Item 1: 2\u00d713 = 26\u2003\n\u2003Item 2: 2\u00d732 = 64\u2003\n\u2003Item 3: 1\u00d790 = 90\u2003\n\u2003Item 4: 1\u00d713 = 13\u2003\n\u2003Item 5: 2\u00d799 = 198\n\u2003Total = 26+64+90+13+198 = 404.\nIf we \u201ctranslate\u201d that roughly by the average value per unit for P2 (assuming around 51 per unit), then Player\u00a02 would expect around (2+2+1+1+2 = 8 units) \u00d751 \u2248408\u2014 which is nearly what one might expect for a fair offer in light of their outside option drawn from a range up to roughly 816. (Of course, Player\u00a02\u2019s actual private values may differ, but offering something that on my scale gives them roughly 404\u2013408 should be competitive.)\n\nThis offer \u2013 represented as the list of units to give to Player\u00a02 \u2013 is valid (every number is within the available quantity) and strikes a balance between ensuring I get at least a slightly better deal than my own outside offer, while also \u201ccompensating\u201d Player\u00a02 with a share on the items that they might value well in expectation.\n\nThus, in round 1 my action is to make the counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 1, 1, 2]}",

However, I also know my overall \u201cpie\u201d (the total value if I got everything) is 570, and I value certain items more than others. In particular, item 4 and item 5 are very valuable to me (61 and 55 per unit, respectively). In the current offer I\u2019m only getting 1 unit of item 4 even though there are 3 available. (Similarly, for item 5, I already receive all available in the current offer.) \n\nTo improve my outcome without overly \u201csqueezing\u201d Player 1 (because I don\u2019t know their exact private values) I can try to get one extra unit of the high\u2010value item 4.

If I propose a counteroffer in which I request that Player 1 get 1 unit of item 4 (instead of 2) while leaving other items as close to what they had, then my allocation becomes:\n\u2003\u2022 For item 1: I still give them 2 (so I get 4 \u2013 2 = 2)\n\u2003\u2022 For item 2: Give 2 (I get 2)\n\u2003\u2022 For item 3: Give them 2 (I get 1, because total 3)\n\u2003\u2022 For item 4: Give them 1 (I then get 3 \u2013 1 = 2)\n\u2003\u2022 For item 5: Give them 0 (I get all 2)\n\nMy resulting bundle is: [2, 2, 1, 2, 2].

Given that I still leave them a non\u2010trivial share (and they don\u2019t see my private values) this counteroffer seems reasonable as a first move to improve my outcome.\n\nThus, my action in round 1 is to make the counteroffer.

Assuming their preferences make these trades acceptable (and given the negotiation dynamics with discounting), this counteroffer is plausible.\n\nStep 4: Decide on your action.\n\u2022 Since accepting would give you a worse outcome than your outside option, and you believe a counteroffer such as [3,2,1,2,1] improves your prospects, your action is to COUNTEROFFER.\n\nThus, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3,2,1,2,1]}",

So I must propose a division that gives me more than 363 in my utility, while offering Player\u00a02 an amount that makes it worthwhile for him to accept rather than risk his unknown outside offer (which for him is drawn uniformly between 1 and his total value; based on an \u201caverage\u201d of roughly \u00bd his maximum, this is expected to be in the 450\u2013500 range in an \u201cexpected\u2010unit\u2010value\u201d sense). I want to keep those parts of the \u201cpie\u201d that are most valuable to me while \u201cconceding\u201d on items for which my value is low. My own values are high for items 1 and 3 (96 and 58 respectively) and moderate for item 4 (44) but are lowest for items 2 and 5 (24 and 22, respectively). \n\nA natural idea is to give Player\u00a02 all of the items on which my own value is low (namely, all 7 units of item 2 and the single unit of item 5) and then \u201ctop-up\u201d with a few units of an item where I can sacrifice a little. In this case, adding 2 units of item 4 (each of which is worth 44 for me) helps boost his potential \u201cexpected value\u201d (if we imagine that for him \u2013 with values drawn roughly uniformly from 1 to 101 \u2013 each unit is around 51 on average) by about 2\u00d751 = 102. \n\nConcretely, if I give him:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a01: 0 units (so I keep both, worth 2\u00d796 = 192 to me)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a02: all 7 units (worth 7\u00d724 = 168 for me)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a03: 0 units (I keep both, worth 2\u00d758 = 116)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a04: 2 units (leaving me 4 units; I lose 2\u00d744 = 88 in my value compared to taking them)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a05: 1 unit (I give away the sole unit, worth 22)\n\nThen my share is from item 1, 3, and the remaining item 4:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Value = 192 + 116 + (4\u00d744 = 176) = 484\nand Player\u00a02 gets an \u201callocation\u201d (from my perspective) that I value at:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 2: 168, plus item 4: 2\u00d744 = 88, plus item 5: 22, totaling 178.\nBut note that my numbers are not his numbers \u2013 his own per\u2010unit values are random but roughly centered around 51. If he receives all of item 2 and item 5 plus 2 units of item 4, then in expectation his value would be about:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 2: 7\u00d751 = 357, plus item 4: 2\u00d751 = 102, plus item 5: 1\u00d751 = 51, which sums to roughly 510.\nThis expected 510 is a slight improvement over his \u201coutside offer\u201d expectation (which would be roughly half of his maximum possible) and should be acceptable for him given the risk and the discounting (with no discount in round 1).\n\nThus, this division gives me 484 (well above my outside option of 363) and gives Player\u00a02 a promising offer that is \u201cin his ball\u2010park\u201d so that he is likely to accept rather than walk away or counter.\n\nSo I propose the counteroffer by offering Player\u00a02 the following quantities for items 1 through 5:\n\u2003[0, 7, 0, 2, 1]\n\nMy final answer is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 7, 0, 2, 1]}",

A \u201cfair\u2010ish\u201d split on items with high potential value (items 2, 4, and 5) is therefore needed. Conversely, I can be more willing to hand over the units that matter little to me (item 3) and modest units of lower\u2010value item 1.\n\u2022 A reasonable proposal is to offer roughly half of the units of items that I value highly while conceding full control of item 3:\n\u2003\u2013 For item 1 (5 units): offer 3 to Player 2 and keep 2.\n\u2003\u2013 For item 2 (6 units): offer 3 to Player 2 and keep 3.\n\u2003\u2013 For item 3 (3 units): offer all 3 units to Player 2.\n\u2003\u2013 For item 4 (7 units): offer 3 to Player 2 and keep 4.\n\u2003\u2013 For item 5 (5 units): offer 2 to Player 2 and keep 3.\n\u2022 Under this division my payoff becomes: 2\u00d78 + 3\u00d746 + 0\u00d71 + 4\u00d756 + 3\u00d750 = 16 + 138 + 0 + 224 + 150 = 528 (which comfortably beats my outside offer of 351), and under an expected average for Player 2 the split should be at or above what his fallback might be.\n\u2022 Thus, as Player 1 in round 1 my action is to propose the counteroffer [3, 3, 3, 3, 2].\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 3, 3, 3, 2]}",

Under the current offer you\u2019d receive\n\u2003\u2022 item 1: 3 units (since there are 5, Player 1 gets 2),\n\u2003\u2022 item 2: 3 (6 \u2013 3),\n\u2003\u2022 item 3: 3 (3 \u2013 0),\n\u2003\u2022 item 4: 3 (7 \u2013 4),\n\u2003\u2022 item 5: 2 (5 \u2013 3).\nThat would give me a value of \n\u2003\u20033\u00d737 + 3\u00d758 + 3\u00d75 + 3\u00d721 + 2\u00d777 = 111 + 174 + 15 + 63 + 154 = 517,\nwhich is better than my outside offer value (410) in round 1 (no discount yet).\n\nHowever, I can try to improve my share by taking more of the items I value highly (for me item 5 is very valuable, and item 2 also) while conceding a little on items of lower importance (like item 3, for which my private value is only 5). At the same time I want to \u201ckeep the pie\u201d given to Player 1 roughly as attractive as in the current offer so that they would be willing to eventually agree.\n\nIn the current division Player 1 gets:\n\u2003\u2022 item 1: 2,\n\u2003\u2022 item 2: 3,\n\u2003\u2022 item 3: 0,\n\u2003\u2022 item 4: 4,\n\u2003\u2022 item 5: 3.\nThat sums to 2+3+0+4+3 = 12 units across items. If I demand more of item 5 (to boost my overall value, since 77 per unit is very good for me), I must \u201ctake\u201d units from Player 1\u2019s share. To try to \u201ccompensate\u201d for the loss in item 5 without hurting them too much I can offer them a little extra of an item I don\u2019t mind giving up (item 3, which is only worth 5 per unit for me). \n\nFor example, if I modify item 5 so that I receive 3 instead of 2 (so that Player 1 gets 5 \u2013 3 = 2 rather than 3) I gain an extra 77 value. To keep the total \u201cbundle\u201d for Player 1 near their previous allocation (12 units in total) I can give them 1 unit of item 3 (so they get 1 instead of 0) which adds an expected value unit for them without costing me too much (only 5).\n\nThus, I propose to leave the other items as originally allocated:\n\u2003\u2013 item 1: keep my 3 units (so offer Player 1 gets 5 \u2013 3 = 2),\n\u2003\u2013 item 2: keep my 3 units (offer: 6 \u2013 3 = 3),\n\u2003\u2013 item 4: keep my 3 units (offer: 7 \u2013 3 = 4),\nand adjust items where I can re\u2010allocate the division:\n\u2003\u2013 item 3: instead of 3 for me (0 for them) I take 2 (and offer 1 to them),\n\u2003\u2013 item 5: instead of 2 for me (3 for them) I take 3 (and offer 2 to them).\n\nThis counteroffer is described by the offer array to Player 1 (that is, the quantities I propose they receive) as:\n\u2003[2, 3, 1, 4, 2].\n\nUnder this division I would receive:\n\u2003\u2022 item 1: 5 \u2013 2 = 3 units (value 3\u00d737 = 111),\n\u2003\u2022 item 2: 6 \u2013 3 = 3 units (174),\n\u2003\u2022 item 3: 3 \u2013 1 = 2 units (10),\n\u2003\u2022 item 4: 7 \u2013 4 = 3 units (63),\n\u2003\u2022 item 5: 5 \u2013 2 = 3 units (231).\nTotal value = 111 + 174 + 10 + 63 + 231 = 589, which is an improvement over 517 while roughly keeping Player 1\u2019s \u201ctake\u201d (2, 3, 1, 4, 2 totaling 12 units) similar to what they had in the current offer.\n\nGiven that this counteroffer improves my outcome (and it\u2019s made in round 1 with no discounting yet) while attempting to leave an acceptable bundle for Player 1, my chosen action is to make this counteroffer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 3, 1, 4, 2]}",

                    "response": "My reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. We have a total \u201cpie\u201d of items: 3 units of item1, 1 of item2, 5 of item3, 4 of item4, and 3 of item5. My private per\u2010unit values for these items are very high on item1 (76) and item4 (90) but low on items 2 (18), 3 (20), and especially 5 (2). In contrast, given that Player\u00a02\u2019s values are drawn uniformly from 1 to 101 the approximate average per\u2013unit value is about 51 for every item. In effect, I have a large relative advantage on items 1 and 4 but a disadvantage (or little advantage) on items 2, 3, and 5.\n\n2. Since I am the first mover and must set an offer which Player\u00a02 will consider versus their outside option (with an expected average value roughly (total value+1)/2), I want to give Player\u00a02 items that are \u201ccheap\u201d for me but \u201cvaluable\u201d in expectation to them. In our allocation, I can afford to let Player\u00a02 have all of the items that I value little\u2014items 2, 3, and 5\u2014thus boosting the perceived deal\u2010value for them without sacrificing much in my own payoff.\n\n3. In concrete numbers the available totals are:\n\u2003\u2013 Items 2, 3, and 5: There is 1, 5, and 3 unit respectively. If I assign these entirely to Player\u00a02, based on their expected value of 51 per unit, they\u2019d \u201csee\u201d roughly 1\u00d751 + 5\u00d751 + 3\u00d751 = 9\u00d751 = 459 in value from these items. That is very likely above their outside option (drawn uniformly in [1, their total value]) and leaves me extra bargaining room.\n\u2003\u2013 For items 1 and 4, where I have the advantage, I keep all available units (3 and 4 respectively). This gives me an immediate payoff of 3\u00d776 + 4\u00d790 = 228 + 360 = 588 (before discounting, and discounting is 1 in round 1).\n\n4. Thus a natural offer is to offer Player\u00a02 the entire stock of items 2, 3, and 5, and nothing of items 1 and 4. In the format required (the offer list representing the units given to Player\u00a02 respectively for items 1 through 5), that is: [0, 1, 5, 0, 3].\n\nBased on this reasoning, my action in this round is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 5, 0, 3]}",

One natural idea is to propose a counteroffer that (a) improves my share of item 4, while (b) not \u201cpunishing\u201d Player 1 too much compared to what they currently have. For example, in the original offer Player 1 ends up with 5 units of item 4. A counteroffer that gives them 4 units of item 4 (a loss of 1 unit relative to the current offer) might be acceptable if I keep more of that high\u2010value item for myself.\n\nA candidate counteroffer is to propose that Player 1 gets:\n\u2003\u2022 3 units of item 1,\n\u2003\u2022 3 units of item 2,\n\u2003\u2022 3 units of item 3,\n\u2003\u2022 4 units of item 4, and\n\u2003\u2022 1 unit of item 5.\n(This \u201coffer list\u201d is what I give to Player 1.)\nThen my allocation becomes the complement:\n\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 4\u20133 = 1,\n\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 4\u20133 = 1,\n\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 4\u20133 = 1,\n\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 7\u20134 = 3,\n\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 1\u20131 = 0.\nMy own value now would be:\n\u2003\u20036\u00d71 + 7\u00d71 + 24\u00d71 + 92\u00d73 + 11\u00d70 = 6 + 7 + 24 + 276 = 313.\nThus, compared to accepting the current offer (value 221), I would be improving my outcome by 92 value points without completely \u201cdumping\u201d Player 1 \u2013 they get nearly what they had before except for one less unit of the high\u2010value item 4.\n\nIt is round 1 and I still have room to negotiate.

                    "response": "I'll explain my reasoning. First I note that I want to guarantee myself a deal better than my outside offer of 323. In full allocation I\u2019d get 503, but I care most about keeping the items that have high value for me and \u201csacrificing\u201d those that cost me little but are quite desirable (in expectation) for the opponent. My private values are:\n\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 24 per unit\n\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 7 per unit\n\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 51 per unit\u2003(only 1 unit)\n\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 25 per unit\n\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 98 per unit\n\nBecause I value item 2 very low while typical opponent values (drawn uniformly between 1 and 101) average to about 51, it makes sense to give away all of item 2. Next, I look among the other items and see that item 1 is slightly \u201ccheaper\u201d for me (24 per unit) than item 4 (25 per unit). (Item 3 and item 5 are too valuable for me to sacrifice.) \n\nI must also give the opponent enough \u201cexpected value\u201d (recalling that for Player 2 the expected per\u2010unit value is about 51) so that his share is appealing relative to his outside offer. His outside offer is drawn from a uniform distribution between 1 and his maximum (which in expectation is about half of his total potential of roughly 867, i.e. about 433). Thus I target an offer giving him roughly 430+ in expected value. \n\nIf I give him all 5 units of item 2, that amounts (from his expected perspective) to 5\u00d751 = 255. To reach around 430\u2013460, I add about 4 units of item 1 (4\u00d751 = 204).

That means that if I want to beat 323 by closing in round 2 I must secure a raw outcome of at least about 323/0.98 \u2248 330 in my own \u201citem\u2010value.\u201d\n\nLooking at my private per\u2010unit values:\n \u2022 Item1: 24 \n \u2022 Item2: 7 \n \u2022 Item3: 51 \n \u2022 Item4: 25 \n \u2022 Item5: 98 \nand the total available items are:\n \u2022 4 of item 1 \n \u2022 5 of item 2 \n \u2022 1 of item 3 \n \u2022 5 of item 4 \n \u2022 2 of item 5 \nI note that my \u201chigh\u2010value\u201d items are type 3, type 4, and especially type 5. (In fact, if I got everything from types 3, 4, and 5 I would receive 51 + 125 + 196 = 372 in raw value.) \n\nLet\u2019s recall the offers so far:\n\u2022 In round 1 I offered to give Player 2: [4, 5, 0, 0, 0]. Under that offer I would keep:\n\u2003\u2013 Item1: 0, item2: 0, item3: 1, item4: 5, item5: 2,\n\u2003which gives me a sum of 1\u00d751 + 5\u00d725 + 2\u00d798 = 51 + 125 + 196 = 372.\n\u2022 In round 1 Player 2 counteroffered with [0, 5, 1, 5, 0]\u2014i.e. offering me those items. If I accepted that I would have received\n\u2003\u2013 Item1: 0, item2: 5, item3: 1, item4: 5, item5: 0,\n\u2003with raw value = 0\u00d724 + 5\u00d77 + 1\u00d751 + 5\u00d725 + 0\u00d798 = 35 + 51 + 125 = 211.\nThen after discount (0.98) the value would be 211\u00d70.98 \u2248 206.8 \u2013 far below my outside option of 323.\n\nSo to do better than walking away I must aim for a deal where my \u201craw\u201d value is at least about 330 so that after discount it\u2019s above 323. My original offer, if accepted, gives me 372 raw (or about 364.6 after discount). Even though Player 2 rejected my original offer in round 1, at this point we are in round 2 so any further delay leads to deeper discounting. Player 2 may now prefer to accept a division that is \u201csticky\u201d to my original one rather than risk a round\u20103 outcome with heavier discounting.\n\nAlso note that in my original offer I gave Player 2\n\u2003[4, 5, 0, 0, 0]\nwhich means that Player 2 would receive all of item 1 and item 2 while I keep item 3, item 4, and item 5 \u2013 i.e. the high\u2013value items. This allocation gives me a strong payoff and (given that no one is better off in waiting when discounting is factored in) may be acceptable to Player 2 now.\n\nBecause there is risk in delaying further (and the current offer on the table from Player 2 gives me much less than my outside alternative), my best response is not to accept their inferior division but rather to stand firm with a counteroffer very similar to my round\u20131 proposal.\n\nThus, I will counteroffer with the same split I originally proposed:\n\u2003\u2022 Offer Player 2: [4, 5, 0, 0, 0]\nwhich gives me the remaining items: [0, 0, 1, 5, 2].

Your outside option guarantees 384, so accepting the current offer is not acceptable.\n\nStep 2: Look back at your previous counteroffer. In round 1 you had offered Player\u00a01 [0, 5, 1, 5, 0]. Recall that when you make an offer you propose to give the other player these items and keep the remainder.

                    "response": "Step 1 \u2013 Understand the situation:\n\u2022 There are 5 item types (quantities: [4, 5, 1, 5, 2]).\n\u2022 My private per\u2010unit values are [24, 7, 51, 25, 98], so my maximum raw total is 503.\n\u2022 My outside option is 323 (un-discounted), so any deal I accept in round 3 (which is discounted by 0.98\u00b2 \u2248 0.9604) must give me a raw value v meeting\n\u2003\u2003v \u00d7 0.9604 \u2265 323\u2003\u27f9\u2003v \u2265 about 323/0.9604 \u2248 337.\n\u2022 The current offer on the table gives me [0, 5, 1, 5, 0] (i.e. my share if I accept). My raw value there is:\n\u2003\u20030\u00d724 + 5\u00d77 + 1\u00d751 + 5\u00d725 + 0\u00d798 = 35 + 51 + 125 = 211,\n\u2003\u2003which discounted is roughly 202.7 \u2013 far below my outside option.\n\u2022 Thus, acceptance is unattractive. I must either WALK away (and secure 323) or try to propose a counteroffer that nets me more than 323 (after discount).\n\nStep 2 \u2013 Designing a counteroffer:\n\u2022 I can propose my own division by specifying what I give to Player\u2082 (the \u201coffer\u201d vector). My final allocation will be the totals minus that vector.\n\u2022 My goal is to \u201ckeep\u201d a bundle whose raw value is at least roughly 337.\n\u2022 I value items highly except item 2 which is relatively less valuable (7/unit). In contrast, items 3 and 5 are very valuable to me.\n\u2022 Reviewing the negotiations, Player\u2082\u2019s earlier offer (as \u201cwhat they gave me\u201d) was [0,5,1,5,0], meaning Player\u2082 kept the complement [4,0,0,0,2]. That suggests they are likely eager for items 1 and 5.\n\u2022 To get a deal that improves my outcome over my outside option, I need to secure a bundle with raw value at least 337, while offering Player\u2082 enough so they see a benefit over their (unknown) outside alternative.\n\nStep 3 \u2013 A candidate counteroffer:\n\u2022 Consider offering Player\u2082: [2, 2, 0, 0, 1]. This is valid (each coordinate is within the available units).\n\u2022 Then my allocation becomes totals minus that:\n\u2003\u2003Item\u2081: 4 \u2013 2 = 2,\n\u2003\u2003Item\u2082: 5 \u2013 2 = 3,\n\u2003\u2003Item\u2083: 1 \u2013 0 = 1,\n\u2003\u2003Item\u2084: 5 \u2013 0 = 5,\n\u2003\u2003Item\u2085: 2 \u2013 1 = 1.\n\u2022 My raw value is:\n\u2003\u20032\u00d724 + 3\u00d77 + 1\u00d751 + 5\u00d725 + 1\u00d798 = 48 + 21 + 51 + 125 + 98 = 343.\n\u2003\u2003Discounted value = 343 \u00d7 0.9604 \u2248 329.3, which exceeds my outside option of 323.\n\u2022 Although Player\u2082 likely prefers items 1 and 5, offering them [2,2,0,0,1] may be acceptable given the threat of discounting and the risks of a last\u2010round breakdown. It gives me a better outcome while still supplying Player\u2082 with some high\u2010quantity items (2 units of item\u2081 and 1 unit of item\u2085).\n\nStep 4 \u2013 Conclusion:\nSince accepting the current offer is far worse and walking away only nets me 323, I propose the above counteroffer that secures me a raw value of 343 (\u2248329 after discount), which is better than my outside option, while hoping that Player\u2082 will prefer a negotiated deal over risking their own outside offer.\n\nThus, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 0, 0, 1]}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This is significantly better than an effective value of about 203.5.\n\nStep 4: Note the game\u2019s rule: In the last round, if Player 2 (me) makes a counteroffer, it is treated as a WALK.
