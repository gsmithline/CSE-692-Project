By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    21 x 0 + 16 x 2 + 69 x 0 + 12 x 0 + 95 x 0\n    which is 32 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 33. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 2, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 2, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To decide on the appropriate action, let's go through the analysis step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n- **Outside Offer Value**: 33\n- **Values of the Items to Me**:\n  - Item 1: 21 per unit\n  - Item 2: 16 per unit\n  - Item 3: 69 per unit\n  - Item 4: 12 per unit\n  - Item 5: 95 per unit\n- **Total Pool of Items**: [3 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 8 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5]\n- **Discount Factor**: \u03b3 = 0.9\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n- **Current Offer From Player 1 ([2, 1, 2, 1, 2])**:\n  - Value to me = (2 \u00d7 21) + (1 \u00d7 16) + (2 \u00d7 69) + (1 \u00d7 12) + (2 \u00d7 95)\n  - = 42 + 16 + 138 + 12 + 190\n  - = 398\n\nThe value of the current offer to me is 398.\n\nSince it is round 1, and if I accept the offer, the value is not affected by the discount factor. It remains 398 in this round. \n\n- **Compare to Outside Offer (33)**\n  - The current offer value (398) is clearly better than the outside offer value (33).\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n- **Accepting the Current Offer**: The current offer provides a value of 398, which is significantly better than my outside offer of 33.\n- **Walking Away**: This would result in receiving the outside offer value of 33, which is much less favorable.\n- **Proposing a Counteroffer**: Since the current offer is already highly favorable compared to my outside offer, making a counteroffer would risk a less favorable outcome due to negotiation dynamics.\n\n### Decision\nGiven the analysis, the best course of action is to accept the current offer since it provides a significantly higher value than my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

Since this is round 1, the discount hasn't affected the outcome in terms of multiplying my value by any discount yet.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n#### Current Offer ([0, 2, 1, 2, 1]):\n\n- Item 1: 0 \u00d7 57 = 0\n- Item 2: 2 \u00d7 26 = 52\n- Item 3: 1 \u00d7 48 = 48\n- Item 4: 2 \u00d7 50 = 100\n- Item 5: 1 \u00d7 100 = 100\n\n- **Total Value if I Accept**: \n  - 0 + 52 + 48 + 100 + 100 = 300\n\n#### Comparison with My Outside Offer:\n\n- My outside offer is 711, which is much higher than the value of accepting the current offer (300).\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\n- **Accepting the Current Offer**: The value from the current offer is 300, which is less than my outside offer of 711. Accepting is not advisable as it would result in a lower payoff than my fallback option.\n  \n- **Walking Away**: My outside offer is 711, so walking away ensures that I get this value, which is higher than the current offer's value.\n\n- **Proposing a Counteroffer**: I need to propose a counteroffer that is more beneficial than my outside offer.\n\nLet's construct a counteroffer:\n\nPossible Counteroffer (ensuring my value is greater than 711):\n- Let's try to maximize high-value items while making a fair division:\n\nSuppose I keep [3, 0, 3, 1, 3], so I give Player 1 [0, 3, 1, 2, 2].\n\n- Keeping for Myself:\n  - Item 1: 3 \u00d7 57 = 171\n  - Item 2: 0 \u00d7 26 = 0\n  - Item 3: 3 \u00d7 48 = 144\n  - Item 4: 1 \u00d7 50 = 50\n  - Item 5: 3 \u00d7 100 = 300\n\n- **Total Value If I Keep This**: \n  - 171 + 0 + 144 + 50 + 300 = 665\n\nTesting against the outside offer, 665 is less than 711. Let's try tweaking the division further to ensure we get 711 or more.\n\nHow about keeping [2, 0, 3, 3, 3]? (Offering Player 1 [1, 3, 1, 0, 2])\n\n- Keeping for Myself:\n  - Item 1: 2 \u00d7 57 = 114\n  - Item 2: 0 \u00d7 26 = 0\n  - Item 3: 3 \u00d7 48 = 144\n  - Item 4: 3 \u00d7 50 = 150\n  - Item 5: 3 \u00d7 100 = 300\n\n- **Total Value If I Keep This**: \n  - 114 + 0 + 144 + 150 + 300 = 708\n\nThis still falls short. Let's tweak again.\n\nIf I keep [2, 0, 4, 3, 3]? (Offering Player 1 [1, 3, 0, 0, 2])\n\n- Keeping for Myself:\n  - Item 1: 2 \u00d7 57 = 114\n  - Item 2: 0 \u00d7 26 = 0\n  - Item 3: 4 \u00d7 48 = 192\n  - Item 4: 3 \u00d7 50 = 150\n  - Item 5: 3 \u00d7 100 = 300\n\n- **Total Value If I Keep This**: \n  - 114 + 0 + 192 + 150 + 300 = 756\n\nThis value is greater than my outside offer of 711. Thus, I can confidently make this counteroffer.\n\n### Conclusion: Counteroffer\n\nI will propose a counteroffer where I keep [2, 0, 4, 3, 3] and offer Player 1 [1, 3, 0, 0, 2].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 3, 0, 0, 2]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 2, 0, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    57 x 2 + 26 x 0 + 48 x 2 + 50 x 0 + 100 x 5\n    which is 710 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 711. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Item 1: 3 per unit (lowest)\n\nSince this is the first round, I want to make a strategic offer that keeps most of the high-value items for myself while giving Player 2 enough to consider.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 4, 2, 3, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    77 x 4 + 56 x 4 + 32 x 2 + 34 x 3 + 36 x 5\n    which is 878 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 879. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 879. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 705 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 4, 2, 3, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    77 x 4 + 56 x 4 + 32 x 2 + 34 x 3 + 36 x 5\n    which is 878 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 879. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [6, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 3, 0, 1, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [6, 1, 0, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [6, 1, 0, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

A strategic starting point is offering significant items from each category:\n\nI could propose to keep a combination such as [5, 5, 2, 2, 4], which keeps me on a safer ground close to or better than my outside offer value. Thus, I will propose a counteroffer where I maintain a strong position.\n\nHere's my decision:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 1, 2]}\n```\nThis offer allows me to keep [5, 5, 2, 2, 4], ensuring my value remains above my outside offer when appropriately calculated.",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 5, 1, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    78 x 1 + 49 x 1 + 62 x 5 + 20 x 1 + 16 x 4\n    which is 521 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 522. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 4, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 4, 4]\n\n    What is your action?

I'll give them item 2 (which they seem to want), and a bit more of items 4 and 5 than my initial offer.\n\nMy counteroffer: I'll give Player 2 [0, 1, 0, 2, 2]\nThis means I keep [4, 0, 5, 2, 2]\n\nThe value to me would be:\n4 \u00d7 55 + 0 \u00d7 41 + 5 \u00d7 68 + 2 \u00d7 31 + 2 \u00d7 34 = 220 + 0 + 340 + 62 + 68 = 690\n\nIf this is accepted next round: 690 \u00d7 0.81 = 558.9, which is still much better than my outside offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 2, 2]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 522. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 675 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 5, 1, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    78 x 1 + 49 x 1 + 62 x 5 + 20 x 1 + 16 x 4\n    which is 521 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 522. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 4, 4]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 0, 1, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 2, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 2, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To determine the best course of action, let's walk through the analysis step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **My outside offer value**: 522\n- **Values of the items to me**:\n  - Item 1: 78\n  - Item 2: 49\n  - Item 3: 62\n  - Item 4: 20\n  - Item 5: 16\n- **Total pool of items**:\n  - 4 units of item 1\n  - 1 unit of item 2\n  - 5 units of item 3\n  - 4 units of item 4\n  - 4 units of item 5\n- **Discount factor (gamma)**: 0.9. Accepting immediately avoids further discounting; any decision in this round incurs no discount, while waiting for more rounds reduces value by 0.9 per subsequent round.\n  \n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current offer from Player 1 ([0, 1, 0, 2, 2])**:\n  - Offered to me:\n    - 0 units of item 1: 0 \u00d7 78 = 0\n    - 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 49 = 49\n    - 0 units of item 3: 0 \u00d7 62 = 0\n    - 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 20 = 40\n    - 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 16 = 32\n  - Total value = 49 + 40 + 32 = 121\n\nThe total value of the current offer is 121, which is significantly less than my outside offer of 522. Therefore, accepting this offer would not be beneficial.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision Based on the Analysis\n\n- Since the value of the current offer (121) is far less than my outside offer (522), accepting it would violate Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.\n- Walking away ensures I receive my outside offer value of 522.\n- I should make a counteroffer where my value is greater than 522.\n\n### Potential Counteroffers\n\nI will now propose a counteroffer that ensures I get more value than my outside offer. Let's check some scenarios:\n\n- **Potential counteroffer [1, 0, 3, 2, 0] - offer to Player 1**:\n  - My keeping:\n    - 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 78 = 234\n    - 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 49 = 49\n    - 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 62 = 124\n    - 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 20 = 40\n    - 4 units of item 5: 4 \u00d7 16 = 64\n  - Total value = 234 + 49 + 124 + 40 + 64 = 511\n  \nThis is still below my outside offer. Let's adjust.\n\n- **Reconsider another potential counteroffer, like [1, 0, 1, 2, 1] - offer to Player 1**:\n  - My keeping:\n    - 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 78 = 234\n    - 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 49 = 49\n    - 4 units of item 3: 4 \u00d7 62 = 248\n    - 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 20 = 40\n    - 3 units of item 5: 3 \u00d7 16 = 48\n  - Total value = 234 + 49 + 248 + 40 + 48 = 619\n  \nThis offer (619) is above my outside offer (522), and should be proposed.\n\nTherefore, my action will be:\n\n``` \n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 2, 1]}\n``` ",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 2, 0, 4, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    20 x 2 + 40 x 2 + 79 x 0 + 77 x 4 + 2 x 3\n    which is 434 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 435. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 5, 2, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 5, 2, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

Decision-making should account for this reduction, especially since you have an outside offer that guarantees 404.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers\n- **Current Offer**: The current offer gives you [4, 0, 2, 1, 0]. Calculating the total value to you:\n  - 4 units of Item 1 = 4 \u00d7 66 = 264\n  - 0 units of Item 2 = 0\n  - 2 units of Item 3 = 2 \u00d7 24 = 48\n  - 1 unit of Item 4 = 1 \u00d7 31 = 31\n  - 0 units of Item 5 = 0\n\n  **Total value** = 264 + 0 + 48 + 31 + 0 = 343\n\n- **Comparison to Outside Offer**: The current offer is worth 343, which is less than your outside offer of 404. Thus, accepting this would be a mistake according to Mistake 4.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision\n- Based on the analysis, accepting this offer would result in a lesser value than walking away. Thus, the optimal decision would be to either propose a counteroffer or consider walking away if no advantageous counteroffer can be structured. Let's propose a counteroffer that aligns closely with interim values from the pool and improves upon the current offer:\n\nLet's aim for a counteroffer that tries to improve the value while still being appealing to Player 1. For example, consider you keeping a distribution that minimizes what you give away:\n- You aim for 3 of Item 1, 1 of Item 2 because they have relatively high value to you, let's test this:\n  - Keep: [3, 1, 0, 2, 2] (You keep these items)\n  - Give to Player 1: [4, 1, 2, 2, 0]\n\nCalculate new potential offer:\n- 3 units of Item 1 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198\n- 1 unit of Item 2 = 1 \u00d7 33 = 33\n- 0 units of Item 3 = 0\n- 2 units of Item 4 = 2 \u00d7 31 = 62\n- 2 units of Item 5 = 2 \u00d7 93 = 186\n\n**Total value** = 198 + 33 + 0 + 62 + 186 = 479\n\nThis value is greater than your outside offer of 404.

Let me try to develop a more optimal division.\n\nMy ideal allocation for high-value items:\n- Keep all 2 units of item 5 (value 81 each)\n- Keep as much of item 2 (value 65 each) as possible\n- Keep as much of item 4 (value 56 each) as possible\n- Keep some of item 1 (value 40 each)\n- Give most of item 3 (value 25 each)\n\nLet me propose this counteroffer (what I'd give to Player 2):\n[3, 0, 2, 1, 0]\n\nThis means I'd keep:\n- Item 1: 4 units (4 \u00d7 40 = 160)\n- Item 2: 2 units (2 \u00d7 65 = 130)\n- Item 3: 0 units (0 \u00d7 25 = 0)\n- Item 4: 3 units (3 \u00d7 56 = 168)\n- Item 5: 2 units (2 \u00d7 81 = 162)\nTotal for me: 620\n\nWith discount factor for round 2: 620 \u00d7 0.9 = 558\n\nThis is slightly better than my outside offer (552), and would be a good option.\n\nTheir counteroffer was very close to my initial offer, just asking for one more unit of item 4 and one unit of item 2. This suggests they value these items, so my counteroffer adjusts to give slightly more of what they seem to want.\n\nSince 558 > 552, making this counteroffer is better than walking away.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 0, 2, 1, 0]}",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 404. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 404. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 741 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 1, 2, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    66 x 3 + 33 x 1 + 24 x 2 + 31 x 1 + 93 x 1\n    which is 403 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 404. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [4, 0, 2, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [4, 1, 2, 2, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [3, 0, 2, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 0, 2, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To determine my action, I need to evaluate the current offer by Player 1 and any potential counteroffers I could make. Let's follow the steps:\n\n### 1) Analyze the Current Situation:\n- **My outside offer value:** 404\n- **My values for each item:**\n  - Item 1: 66\n  - Item 2: 33\n  - Item 3: 24\n  - Item 4: 31\n  - Item 5: 93\n- **Total pool of items:**\n  - Item 1: 7 units\n  - Item 2: 2 units\n  - Item 3: 2 units\n  - Item 4: 4 units\n  - Item 5: 2 units\n- **Discount factor:** The discount factor is 0.9, which will apply if we move to the next round. This means the values will be discounted by 10% for each round delay in reaching an agreement.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n- **Current Offer from Player 1:** [3, 0, 2, 1, 0]. \n  Calculate the total value if I accept:\n  - Item 1: 3 units \u00d7 66 = 198\n  - Item 2: 0 units \u00d7 33 = 0\n  - Item 3: 2 units \u00d7 24 = 48\n  - Item 4: 1 unit \u00d7 31 = 31\n  - Item 5: 0 units \u00d7 93 = 0\n  - Total value = 198 + 0 + 48 + 31 + 0 = 277\n\n- **My total value for the current offer** is 277, which is less than my outside offer of 404. Therefore, accepting this offer would make Mistake 4 (accepting an offer worse than the outside offer).\n\n### 3) Make a Decision:\n- Should I accept the current offer? No, because 277 < 404.\n- Should I walk away and take my outside offer? Not necessarily, let's see if I can propose a better counteroffer.\n- **Counteroffer Consideration:**\n  - I need to create a division that gives me more than 404 in value.\n\nLet's compute a counteroffer:\n- Suppose I keep [4, 2, 0, 3, 2] items and offer remaining to Player 1.\n  Calculate my value:\n  - Item 1: 3 units \u00d7 66 = 198\n  - Item 2: 2 units \u00d7 33 = 66\n  - Item 3: 0 units \u00d7 24 = 0\n  - Item 4: 3 units \u00d7 31 = 93\n  - Item 5: 2 units \u00d7 93 = 186\n  - Total value = 198 + 66 + 0 + 93 + 186 = 543\n\nSince 543 is greater than my outside offer of 404, this is an acceptable counteroffer.\n\n### My Action:\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 0, 2, 1, 0]}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 39. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 390 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 1, 2, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    17 x 0 + 24 x 1 + 1 x 1 + 5 x 2 + 83 x 0\n    which is 35 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 39. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 0, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1923. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1122 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [9, 2, 2, 4, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    94 x 9 + 46 x 2 + 60 x 2 + 90 x 4 + 84 x 6\n    which is 1922 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1923. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [7, 1, 3, 1, 4]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 1183. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1183. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 741 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [8, 0, 3, 4, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    84 x 8 + 21 x 0 + 34 x 3 + 100 x 4 + 8 x 1\n    which is 1182 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1183. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 2, 4, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 2, 4, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

Let's calculate the total value for me:\n  - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 84 = 84\n  - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 21 = 21\n  - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 34 = 68\n  - 4 units of item 4 = 4 \u00d7 100 = 400\n  - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24\n  - Total value = 84 + 21 + 68 + 400 + 24 = 597\n- **Comparison with Outside Offer**: The value of accepting the current offer (597) is much lower than my outside offer (1183).\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n- Accepting the current offer would result in a lower value than my outside offer, which would result in Mistake 4, so I should not accept it.\n- Walking away would guarantee me a value of 1183.\n- To propose a counteroffer that is at least as valuable as my outside offer, let's explore divisions of items:\n  \n  Let's consider keeping items that maximize my value and check if I can propose an offer that exceeds my outside offer of 1183.\n\n  **Trying to Keep Various Combinations**:\n  - Keep [8, 0, 3, 4, 1] for myself, ensuring an offer to Player 1 that results in at least 1183 for me:\n    - My value: (84 x 8) + (21 x 0) + (34 x 3) + (100 x 4) + (8 x 1)\n    - My value = 672 + 0 + 102 + 400 + 8 = 1182 (less than outside offer, not acceptable)\n  \n  Let's try keeping [7, 0, 2, 3, 2] (offering [1, 2, 1, 3, 2] to Player 1):\n    - My value: (84 x 7) + (21 x 0) + (34 x 2) + (100 x 3) + (8 x 2)\n    - My value = 588 + 0 + 68 + 300 + 16 = 972 (again less than outside offer, not acceptable)\n\n  - Keep [8, 0, 3, 5, 1] (offering [0, 2, 0, 1, 3] to Player 1):\n    - My value: (84 x 8) + (21 x 0) + (34 x 3) + (100 x 5) + (8 x 1)\n    - My value = 672 + 0 + 102 + 500 + 8 = 1282 (more than outside offer, acceptable)\n\nThe counteroffer of [0, 2, 0, 1, 3] to Player 1 keeps my value at 1282, which is greater than my outside offer of 1183.

This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    67 x 0 + 58 x 0 + 85 x 0 + 42 x 0 + 25 x 1\n    which is 25 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 41. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 0, 4, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 0, 4, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "To address this negotiation, let's follow the step-by-step process with the information provided:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - **Outside offer value:** 41\n   - **Values of the items (per unit):** \n     - Item 1: 67\n     - Item 2: 58\n     - Item 3: 85\n     - Item 4: 42\n     - Item 5: 25\n   - **Total pool of items:** \n     - 4 units each of items 1, 2, 3, and 4\n     - 2 units of item 5\n   - **Discount factor influence:** \n     - The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9 and applies in future rounds, reducing the overall value if negotiations continue without agreement.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer proposed by Player 1 ([2, 1, 0, 4, 2]) gives me:**\n     - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 67 = 134\n     - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 58 = 58\n     - 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 85 = 0\n     - 4 units of item 4 = 4 \u00d7 42 = 168\n     - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 25 = 50\n     - Total value of the offer = 134 + 58 + 0 + 168 + 50 = 410\n\n   - **Compare to my outside offer value:**\n     - The value of the current offer (410) is greater than my outside offer (41).\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - The current offer (410) is much greater than my outside offer (41), so accepting it would be beneficial.\n   - It's round 1, meaning no discount applies yet (as it would in future rounds), so accepting the current offer provides its full value.\n   - Mistakes to avoid: \n     - Mistake 4 (Accepting an offer worse than the outside offer) is avoided as the current offer's value (410) exceeds my outside offer (41).\n     - Mistake 5 (Walking away from a better offer) would apply if I chose \"WALK,\" thus I should avoid this.\n\nTherefore, based on the analysis, the best action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 215. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 215. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 507 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 2, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    2 x 0 + 19 x 0 + 73 x 2 + 68 x 1 + 7 x 0\n    which is 214 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 215. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 2, 0, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 2, 0, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 4, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    52 x 0 + 18 x 0 + 82 x 1 + 5 x 4 + 39 x 2\n    which is 180 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 181. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 5, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 5, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

If I make a counteroffer, the effective value for me (if accepted in a future round) will be multiplied by 0.9 for each additional round it takes.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n- **Current Offer [1, 0, 5, 1, 0] (Value for Me)**:\n  - Item 1: 1 \u00d7 52 = 52\n  - Item 2: 0 \u00d7 18 = 0\n  - Item 3: 5 \u00d7 82 = 410\n  - Item 4: 1 \u00d7 5 = 5\n  - Item 5: 0 \u00d7 39 = 0\n  - **Total Value** = 52 + 0 + 410 + 5 + 0 = 467\n\n  The current offer's value (467) is well above my outside offer value (181). Therefore, this is a good offer for me, and I could benefit from accepting it.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\nThe value of the current offer (467) is much higher than my outside offer (181). Hence, accepting the current offer will give me a significantly better outcome. Rejecting this offer would result in undue risk or misalignment with my objectives. Moreover, accepting it avoids any reduction in value due to the discount factor in future rounds.\n\nTherefore, based on the analysis, the logical action is to accept the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 885. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 885. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 798 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 1, 1, 4, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    69 x 5 + 32 x 1 + 13 x 1 + 95 x 4 + 57 x 2\n    which is 884 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 885. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 2, 5, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 2, 5, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "To determine the appropriate action, I'll go through the analysis step by step:\n\n1) **Analyze the Current Situation:**\n   - **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer is 885.\n   - **Value of Items:**\n     - Item 1: 69 per unit\n     - Item 2: 32 per unit\n     - Item 3: 13 per unit\n     - Item 4: 95 per unit\n     - Item 5: 57 per unit\n   - **Total Pool of Items:** [5, 4, 3, 6, 2]\n   - **Discount Factor:** The value of any deal will be multiplied by \\( \\gamma^{(r-1)} \\). In round 1, this is \\( \\gamma^0 = 1 \\). Thus, there's no reduction in the value due to the discount factor in this round.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n   - **Current Offer (Player 1 offered you [1, 0, 2, 5, 0]):**\n     - Value = (1 \u00d7 69) + (0 \u00d7 32) + (2 \u00d7 13) + (5 \u00d7 95) + (0 \u00d7 57)\n     - Value = 69 + 0 + 26 + 475 + 0 = 570\n\n   - **Comparison with Outside Offer:**\n     - The current offer's value (570) is less than my outside offer value (885). Thus, accepting this offer would be less beneficial compared to taking my guaranteed outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a Decision Based on Analysis:**\n   - **Current Offer:** The current offer's value to me is 570, which is less than my outside offer value of 885. Therefore, accepting this offer would be a mistake.\n   - **Walk Away:** Walking away guarantees me a value of 885. This is a safe option.\n   - **Counteroffer Strategy:** I need to propose a counteroffer that gives me a total value at least greater than 885. \n\nLet's form a counteroffer scheme that gives a total value greater than 885:\n\n   - Suppose I propose to keep 4 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5 for myself:\n   - This means I offer to the other player: [1, 4, 2, 1, 0]  \n\n   - Calculate the value to me for keeping: [4, 0, 1, 5, 2]\n     - Value = (4 \u00d7 69) + (0 \u00d7 32) + (1 \u00d7 13) + (5 \u00d7 95) + (2 \u00d7 57)\n     - Value = 276 + 0 + 13 + 475 + 114 = 878\n\n   - 878 is still less than 885. Let me recalculate and adjust:\n\nLet's try [3, 4, 2, 2, 1] for Player 1 i.e., keeping [2, 0, 1, 4, 1] for myself:\n   - Calculate the value to me for keeping: [2, 0, 1, 4, 1]\n     - Value = (2 \u00d7 69) + (0 \u00d7 32) + (1 \u00d7 13) + (4 \u00d7 95) + (1 \u00d7 57)\n     - Value = 138 + 0 + 13 + 380 + 57 = 588\n\nThis part provides the economic discovery.\n   *Value to me is still below 885.*\n\nOnce more, try adjusting:\n\n Offering Player 1: [2, 4, 2, 0, 1] --> keeping [3, 0, 1, 6, 1] for myself:\n   - Calculate the value to me for keeping: [3, 0, 1, 6, 1]\n     - Value = (3 \u00d7 69) + (0 \u00d7 32) + (1 \u00d7 13) + (6 \u00d7 95) + (1 \u00d7 57)\n     - Value = 207 + 0 + 13 + 570 + 57 = 847 *.* Recalculated improvement yet still below.  \n\nCheck:\nCounteroffer offering Player 1: [3, 4, 0, 1, 1] so keeping: [2, 0, 3, 5, 1] for myself:\n   - Calculate the value to me for keeping: [2, 0, 3, 5, 1]\n     - Value = (2 \u00d7 69) + (0 \u00d7 32) + (3 \u00d7 13) + (5 \u00d7 95) + (1 \u00d7 57)\n     - Value = 138 + 0 + 39 + 475 + 57 = 709\n\nStill below belated captured reassessmenting for alignment:\nCounteroffer offering Player 1: [2, 4, 0, 2, 0] consistent to keeping: [3, 0, 3, 4, 2] for me:\n   - Calculate the value to me for keeping: [3, 0, 3, 4, 1]\n     - Value = (3 \u00d7 69) + (0 \u00d7 32) + (3 \u00d7 13) + (4 \u00d7 95) + (2 \u00d7 57)\n     - Value = 207 + 0 + 39 + 380 + 114 = 740 *.* Check & verify by concept so reformement.\n\nFinally to wrap these propose diversified composition:\nCounteroffer offering Player 1: [3, 3, 1, 1, 0] therefore keeping: [2, 1, 2, 5, 2],\n  - Calculate value to me for keeping: [2, 1, 2, 5, 2]\n    - Value = (2 \u00d7 69) + (1 \u00d7 32) + (2 \u00d7 13) + (5 \u00d7 95) + (2 \u00d7 57)\n    - Value = 138 + 32 + 26 + 475 + 121 = 801\n\nWith attempts and finalization:\n\nIf not reaching the counter upto satisfaction with improvement note **suggestion for an optimal counteroffer isn't possible here on condition value to be better but yielding a valid share since 801 is lesser:**\n   \nHowever, strategy now recommend deciding a smart **WALK** step:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Your value would be:\n    67 x 0 + 57 x 3 + 94 x 2 + 40 x 5 + 29 x 2\n    which is 617 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 618. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 0, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 3, 0, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "To make an informed decision, I will walk through the step-by-step analysis process.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - **Outside offer value:** My outside offer is 618.\n   - **Values of the items involved:**\n     - Item 1: 67 per unit\n     - Item 2: 57 per unit\n     - Item 3: 94 per unit\n     - Item 4: 40 per unit\n     - Item 5: 29 per unit\n   - **Total pool of items:** \n     - 2 units of Item 1\n     - 3 units of Item 2\n     - 3 units of Item 3\n     - 7 units of Item 4\n     - 2 units of Item 5\n   - **Impact of discount factor:** The discount factor influences the present value gained in future rounds. By round 2, the value of any outcome is multiplied by 0.9. Delaying an agreement might reduce my effective value, so it is essential to compare this effect against potential gains from a better offer.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer ([1, 3, 0, 2, 1]):**\n     - Item 1: 1 \u00d7 67 = 67\n     - Item 2: 3 \u00d7 57 = 171\n     - Item 3: 0 \u00d7 94 = 0\n     - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 40 = 80\n     - Item 5: 1 \u00d7 29 = 29\n     - Total value = 67 + 171 + 0 + 80 + 29 = 347\n   - The current offer gives me a total value of 347, which is significantly less than my outside offer of 618.\n   - **Potential counteroffers:**\n     - I need to keep items such that their total value exceeds my outside offer.\n     - Let's find a potential division where my value is higher than 618. \n\n3) **Decision and Avoid Mistakes:**\n   - **Mistake 1 (Worse than previous offer):** Not applicable at this point, but must ensure counteroffers don't worsen over rounds.\n   - **Mistake 2 (Offer worse than outside offer):** Ensure my retained value is above 618.\n   - **Mistake 3 (Offering all/nothing):** Avoid offering everything or keeping everything outright.\n   - **Mistake 4 (Accept worse offer):** Shouldn't accept the current offer as 347 < 618.\n   - **Mistake 5 (Walking from better offer):** No currently applicable offer is better than my fallback.\n\nTo construct a counteroffer better than my outside offer, for example:\n\nIf I propose keeping:\n- 1 unit of Item 1\n- 0 units of Item 2\n- 3 units of Item 3\n- 5 units of Item 4\n- 1 unit of Item 5\n\nThe resulting values would be:\n- Item 1: 1 \u00d7 67 = 67\n- Item 2: 0 \u00d7 57 = 0\n- Item 3: 3 \u00d7 94 = 282\n- Item 4: 5 \u00d7 40 = 200\n- Item 5: 1 \u00d7 29 = 29\n- Total retained value = 67 + 0 + 282 + 200 + 29 = 578\n\n578 is still less than my outside offer value. So, this is not a viable counteroffer. \n\nTo better this:\nIf I propose keeping:\n- 2 units of Item 1\n- 1 unit of Item 2\n- 3 units of Item 3\n- 4 units of Item 4\n- 1 unit of Item 5\n\nThe resulting values would be:\n- Item 1: 2 \u00d7 67 = 134\n- Item 2: 1 \u00d7 57 = 57\n- Item 3: 3 \u00d7 94 = 282\n- Item 4: 4 \u00d7 40 = 160\n- Item 5: 1 \u00d7 29 = 29\n- Total retained value = 134 + 57 + 282 + 160 + 29 = 662\n\nNow 662 > 618, allowing my best interests while creating fair division:\nMy counteroffer: \n- Offering to Player 1: [0, 2, 0, 3, 1]\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 0, 3, 1]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 2, 5, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    67 x 0 + 57 x 3 + 94 x 2 + 40 x 5 + 29 x 2\n    which is 617 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 618. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 0, 2, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 2, 0, 3, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 0, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 0, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 0, 0, 3, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    5 x 3 + 69 x 0 + 93 x 0 + 89 x 3 + 61 x 0\n    which is 282 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 283. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 4, 4, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 4, 4, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

This is significantly higher than my outside offer of 226.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nWith the information above:\n- The current offer's value to me (617) is much greater than my outside offer (226).\n- Accepting this offer would provide far more value than my fallback position.\n\nThus, it is in my best interest to accept Player 1's offer.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 5, 2, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    46 x 1 + 45 x 0 + 86 x 5 + 41 x 2 + 16 x 1\n    which is 574 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 575. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 5, 5, 3, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    62 x 0 + 55 x 5 + 25 x 5 + 32 x 3 + 59 x 3\n    which is 673 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 674. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 5, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 5, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Since we're in round 1, the discount factor, \\(\\gamma^{(1-1)} = 1\\), does not yet apply.\n\n2) Assess the current offer:\n\n   - The current offer is [1, 5, 1, 1, 1].\n   - Calculating the total value if I accept the current offer:\n     - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 62 = 62\n     - 5 units of item 2 = 5 \u00d7 55 = 275\n     - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 25 = 25\n     - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 32 = 32\n     - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 59 = 59\n   - Total value of accepting the current offer: 62 + 275 + 25 + 32 + 59 = 453\n\n   - The current offer value (453) is less than my outside offer value (674).\n\n3) Make a decision:\n\n   - Should I accept the current offer? No, because the current offer value is less than my outside offer.\n   - Should I walk away and take my outside offer? I could, but it's the first round, so it's worth attempting to negotiate a better deal that exceeds the outside offer value.\n   - Should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n   \n   Let's calculate a beneficial counteroffer:\n   \n   - I want the value of items kept to be greater than 674, excluding the possibility of making mistakes such as proposing an unacceptable offer.\n\n   For example, if I keep:\n   - 1 unit of item 1 = 62\n   - 2 units of item 2 = 110\n   - 8 units of item 3 = 200\n   - 3 units of item 4 = 96\n   - 2 units of item 5 = 118\n    \n   Player 1 receives the remaining:\n   - 1 unit of item 1 = 62\n   - 5 units of item 2\n   - 1 unit of item 3\n   - 1 unit of item 4\n   - 1 unit of item 5\n\n   Total value to me = 62 + 110 + 200 + 96 + 118 = 586, which is still less than my outside offer. I must improve it:\n\n   Adjust the remaining items to:\n   - 0 unit of item 1 = 0\n   - 1 unit of item 2 = 55\n   - 7 units of item 3 = 175\n   - 2 units of item 4 = 64\n   - 1 units of item 5 = 59\n\n  Total still = 353; I will reconfigure. \n\nIf I keep:\n   - 2 unit of item 1 = 124\n   - 2 unit of item 2 = 110\n   - 7 unit of item 3 = 175\n   - 2 unit of item 4 = 64\n   - 3 unit of item 5 = 177\n    \n   Total value for what you keep = 650.\n   \nTaking further adjustments, the total value = 650, which is still below outside offer.  Since I'm in round 1 of 3, there is opportunity, resulting in COUNTEROFFER:\n\nLet's propose a new counteroffer:\n    - [0, 2, 2, 1, 0] to Player 1, keeping the rest:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 2, 1, 0]}",
