Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 366. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 492 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

                    "response": "To effectively negotiate and determine the best course of action, let's first go through the step-by-step analysis:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n1. **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 366.\n2. **Values of the Items Involved:**\n   - Item 1: 52\n   - Item 2: 49\n   - Item 3: 28\n   - Item 4: 30\n   - Item 5: 5\n3. **Total Pool of Items:**\n   - 3 units of item 1\n   - 2 units of item 2\n   - 3 units of item 3\n   - 2 units of item 4\n   - 3 units of item 5\n4. **Discount Factor Impact:** Given the discount factor of 0.98, future offers will be worth slightly less in present value terms. It's essential to weigh the timeliness of agreements\u2014early agreements are more valuable than delayed ones due to this discounting.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n- As there is currently no offer on the table from Player 2, let's consider my initial offer for Player 2.\n- **Total Value of the Full Set of Items:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{3 units of item 1} = 3 \\times 52 = 156 \\\\\n  \\text{2 units of item 2} = 2 \\times 49 = 98 \\\\\n  \\text{3 units of item 3} = 3 \\times 28 = 84 \\\\\n  \\text{2 units of item 4} = 2 \\times 30 = 60 \\\\\n  \\text{3 units of item 5} = 3 \\times 5 = 15 \\\\\n  \\text{Total value} = 156 + 98 + 84 + 60 + 15 = 413\n  \\]\n- **Comparison to Outside Offer:** Any offer must ensure that my retained item values are greater than 366 to be preferable to the outside offer.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\nGiven my outside offer of 366, I want to make an initial offer that maximizes my item retention above that value. Let's propose a reasonable division that satisfies my objective and encourages Player 2 to continue negotiation:\n\n- **Proposed Offer to Player 2:** \n  - Keep high-value items and their portion slightly higher due to their inferred potential utility.\n  \n  **Offer to Player 2:**\n  - Item 1: 1 unit\n  - Item 2: 0 units\n  - Item 3: 1 unit\n  - Item 4: 1 unit\n  - Item 5: 2 units\n  \n- **Calculate My Retained Value:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Retained units of item 1} = 2 \\times 52 = 104 \\\\\n  \\text{Retained units of item 2} = 2 \\times 49 = 98 \\\\\n  \\text{Retained units of item 3} = 2 \\times 28 = 56 \\\\\n  \\text{Retained units of item 4} = 1 \\times 30 = 30 \\\\\n  \\text{Retained units of item 5} = 1 \\times 5 = 5 \\\\\n  \\text{Total retained value} = 104 + 98 + 56 + 30 + 5 = 293\n  \\]\n  \nSince the retained value of 293 is below my outside offer of 366, the calculation indicates that this offer must be revised to meet my objective function values better. \n\n**Revised Offer for Player 2:**\n- Item 1: 1 unit\n- Item 2: 1 unit\n- Item 3: 1 unit\n- Item 4: 0 units\n- Item 5: 2 units \n\nMy new offer ensures a personal payoff above 366. I'll calculate accordingly:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Retained units of item 1} = 2 \\times 52 = 104 \\\\\n\\text{Retained units of item 2} = 1 \\times 49 = 49 \\\\\n\\text{Retained units of item 3} = 2 \\times 28 = 56 \\\\\n\\text{Retained units of item 4} = 2 \\times 30 = 60 \\\\\n\\text{Retained units of item 5} = 1 \\times 5 = 5 \\\\\n\\text{Total retained value} = 104 + 49 + 56 + 60 + 5 = 274\n\\]\n\nThis is still not enough. I will consider this a starting position.\n\nGiven these calculations, none of the potential proposals initially satisfy being above my outside offer, thus state I should provide a better division strategy ensuring an improved payoff.\nLet's ensure the new map reflects greater fairness while proposing intelligent valuations across all prior attempts. I mean to adjust accordingly engagements on the grounds of diminishing time thresholds.\n\nFinally, to avoid rejecting this final chance of offering a better deal, it must satisfy optimal engagement concerning Player 2 activities.\n \n### Decision:\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]}",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items.

This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "To make an informed decision about the negotiation, let's carefully analyze the situation step by step:\n\n### 1) Analyze the Current Situation:\n- **Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer value is 366.\n- **Values of Items**: \n  - Item 1 is valued at 52 per unit.\n  - Item 2 is valued at 49 per unit.\n  - Item 3 is valued at 28 per unit.\n  - Item 4 is valued at 30 per unit.\n  - Item 5 is valued at 5 per unit.\n- **Total Pool of Items**: \n  - 3 units of item 1\n  - 2 units of item 2\n  - 3 units of item 3\n  - 2 units of item 4\n  - 3 units of item 5\n- **Discount Factor**: The discount rate is 0.98 per round, meaning the value of a deal accepted in this round would be multiplied by 0.98.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n#### Current Offer:\n- I'm being offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], so my value would be calculated as follows:\n  - Item 1: 1 unit \u00d7 52 = 52\n  - Item 2: 1 unit \u00d7 49 = 49\n  - Item 3: 1 unit \u00d7 28 = 28\n  - Item 4: 1 unit \u00d7 30 = 30\n  - Item 5: 1 unit \u00d7 5 = 5\n- Total value = 52 + 49 + 28 + 30 + 5 = 164\n- Value adjusted by discount factor = 164 \u00d7 0.98 = 160.72\n\nSince 160.72 is less than my outside offer of 366, accepting the current offer is not advantageous.\n\n#### Assessing Counteroffers:\nI'd need to propose an offer where the total value to me exceeds 366, accounting for the discount factor in subsequent rounds:\n\n1. A potential counteroffer could be [1, 0, 1, 0, 2] offered to Player 2.\n   - My retained value would be:\n     - Item 1: 2 units \u00d7 52 = 104\n     - Item 2: 2 units \u00d7 49 = 98\n     - Item 3: 2 units \u00d7 28 = 56\n     - Item 4: 2 units \u00d7 30 = 60\n     - Item 5: 1 unit \u00d7 5 = 5\n   - Total value = 104 + 98 + 56 + 60 + 5 = 323\n   - Value adjusted by discount factor (Round 3) = 323 \u00d7 0.98 = 316.54\n\nSince 316.54 is still less than my outside offer of 366, proposing such an offer is not beneficial.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision:\nGiven that:\n- The current offer on the table is worth 160.72 when discounted to present value, which is less than my outside offer of 366.\n- The potential counteroffer results in a discounted value less than my outside offer.\n\nThe rational decision is not to accept the current offer or make a counteroffer worse than my outside offer.

If I accept an offer in round 2, the value is multiplied by 0.98. If in round 3, it would be multiplied by 0.98^2.\n\n### 2) Assess the value of offers:\n\n- **For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?**\n  - There is no current offer on the table.\n\n- **For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?**\n  - I need to propose an initial offer for Player 2.\n\nLet's consider different divisions to propose an offer that maximizes my outcome while being fair enough for Player 2 to consider accepting it in future rounds. I need to ensure it\u2019s better than my outside offer, meaning the part I retain should be valued at more than 457 after adjusting for the discount factor. \n\n### Offer Calculation Example:\n\nAssume I keep:\n- 3 units of item 1\n- 1 unit of item 2\n- 2 units of item 3\n- 1 unit of item 4\n- 2 units of item 5\n\nThe value to me would be:\n- Item 1: 3 * 39 = 117\n- Item 2: 1 * 76 = 76\n- Item 3: 2 * 48 = 96\n- Item 4: 1 * 38 = 38\n- Item 5: 2 * 58 = 116\n- Total value = 117 + 76 + 96 + 38 + 116 = 443\n\nThe value of this proposed retention would be 443, which is slightly below my outside offer of 457. Hence, I need a better offer or retain more.\n\n### Final Calculation Before Action:\n\nLet's try another:\n- Keep 4 units of item 1\n- Keep 1 unit of item 2\n- Keep 2 units of item 5\n\nThe value to me would be:\n- Item 1: 4 * 39 = 156\n- Item 2: 1 * 76 = 76\n- Item 5: 2 * 58 = 116\n- Total value = 156 + 76 + 116 = 348\n\nThis is under the required minimum against the discount consideration.\n\n### Action:\nLet\u2019s offer Player 2:\n- 1 unit of item 1\n- 2 units of item 2\n- 3 units of item 3\n- 2 units of item 4\n- 4 units of item 5\n\nThis ensures I keep enough value for a first-round offer. Let's retabulate:\n\nThe value to me would be:\n- Item 1: 4 * 39 = 156\n- Item 2: 1 * 76 = 76\n- Item 3: 0 * 48 = 0\n- Item 4: 1 * 38 = 38\n- Item 5: 0 * 58 = 0\n- Total value = 156 + 76 + 0 + 38 = 270\n\nNot optimal, this must ensure they obtain value possibly above their random fallback but also ensure I retain more later rounds. Therefore, slightly improve Player 2's standing:\n  \nMy optimal division for fair play and still strong anchor beyond my fallback would be 457. Redraft:\n\n- Keep 3 units of item 1\n- Keep 1 unit of item 2\n- Keep 3 units of item 4\n- The value to me would be:\n  - Item 1: 3 * 39 = 117\n  - Item 2: 1 * 76 = 76\n  - Item 4: 3 * 38 = 114\n  - Total value = 117 + 76 + 114 = 307\n\nHaving to act greedily, go with above tentative improvement or fairness escalation next with approaching similar type units:\n\n**My decision is to propose this initial offer:**\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 3, 0, 2]}",

Your value would be:\n    25 x 2 + 89 x 0 + 62 x 1 + 4 x 2 + 79 x 1\n    which is 199 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 201. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This means that a deal in round 2 is worth 0.98 times the value of the deal in round 1, and a deal in round 3 is worth 0.98^2 times the value of the deal in round 1.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [2, 2, 3, 0, 2]. This means they are giving me:\n    *   2 units of item 1\n    *   2 units of item 2\n    *   3 units of item 3\n    *   0 units of item 4\n    *   2 units of item 5\n    My value for this offer is:\n    (2 * 25) + (2 * 89) + (3 * 62) + (0 * 4) + (2 * 79) = 50 + 178 + 186 + 0 + 158 = 572\n    Since 572 > 201, accepting this offer is better than walking away right now.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what happens if I offer something back. A bad counteroffer is offering all the items to player 1 or zero items to player 1. I could try to skew the offer more to my liking. For example, I could try offering to player 1 [3, 1, 0, 3, 2].\n    This would mean that I keep [2, 2, 3, 0, 2]. My value calculation would be:\n    (2 * 25) + (2 * 89) + (3 * 62) + (0 * 4) + (2 * 79) = 50 + 178 + 186 + 0 + 158 = 572\n\n    Another example, I could try offering to player 1 [1, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n    This would mean that I keep [4, 3, 3, 3, 4]. My value calculation would be:\n    (4 * 25) + (3 * 89) + (3 * 62) + (3 * 4) + (4 * 79) = 100 + 267 + 186 + 12 + 316 = 881\n\n    I can also try to calculate what the discounted value of an offer would have to be in the future to make it worth waiting. I would need an offer worth at least 201 / 0.98 = 205.10 in the next round to make walking away now a good decision.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer of [2, 2, 3, 0, 2] gives me a value of 572, which is greater than my outside offer of 201. I could try to get more, but there is a risk that Player 1 walks away. If I were to make the counteroffer to player 1 [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] I would have a value of 881. However, given that I am already receiving a generous offer, I will accept it, as there is no guarantee player 1 would agree to that counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

Therefore, it's beneficial to settle earlier if a favorable deal can be reached.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers**:\n\n   - **Current offer**: There is no current offer on the table.\n   \n   - **Potential counteroffers**: I should propose a division of items that maximizes my value while staying above my outside offer value.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 2, 3, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 1, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 1, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To make an informed decision, let's first address the questions outlined in the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 715.\n   - My values for the items involved are:\n     - Item 1: 19\n     - Item 2: 84\n     - Item 3: 78\n     - Item 4: 87\n     - Item 5: 62\n   - Total pool of items:\n     - 3 units of item 1\n     - 2 units of item 2\n     - 5 units of item 3\n     - 7 units of item 4\n     - 4 units of item 5\n   - Discount factor: Since it is round 2, if we accept any deal now, the value is multiplied by gamma^(r-1) = 0.98^1 = 0.98. This means any value I calculate needs to be multiplied by 0.98 to account for the discount.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer: [0, 0, 1, 2, 1]\n     - Value of accepting current offer:\n       - 0 units of item 1 = 0\n       - 0 units of item 2 = 0\n       - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 78 = 78\n       - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 87 = 174\n       - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 62 = 62\n       - Total value before discount = 314\n       - Total value after applying discount = 314 \u00d7 0.98 \u2248 307.72\n   - Potential counteroffers:\n     - I need to think of offers that give me total value more than 715 but also need to discount by 0.98 for this round. \n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - Should I accept the current offer?\n     - The value of the current offer after discounting (307.72) is less than my outside offer (715). Accepting the current offer would be worse than taking my fallback.\n   - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n     - This would ensure I receive at least the value of 715.\n   - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n     - Ideally, I would want to construct a counteroffer that gives me more than the discounted value of 715.\n     - Let's try to maximize the value I keep: Since it's better to keep higher value items, targeting more of item 2 (high value of 84) and item 4 (high value of 87) makes sense.\n\n     Counteroffer considerations:\n     - [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] gives me 307.72.\n     - Thus, I propose to keep at least a combination that results in more value after discount:\n     - Suppose I propose offering [1, 0, 3, 5, 3] to Player 2:\n       - This would mean I keep [2, 2, 2, 2, 1]:\n         - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 19 = 38\n         - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 84 = 168\n         - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 78 = 156\n         - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 87 = 174\n         - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 62 = 62\n         - Total value before discount = 598\n         - Total value after discount \u2248 598 \u00d7 0.98 = 586.04\n     - This counteroffer would still result in less value than walking away.\n\nSince none of the calculated counteroffers seem to beat taking the outside value after being discounted, the best decision here would be to walk away because insisting on a counter while running the risk of a worse outcome seems more disadvantageous.\n\nTherefore, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Since we're in the first round, if we conclude the negotiation here, it will not be discounted. However, the outcome after round 1 will be discounted, reducing each player's potential gain relative to their personal valuation of the allocation by this factor.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** None (this is the first round, so I will make the first offer).\n   - **Potential counteroffers:**\n     - I need to propose an initial division that maximizes my retained value while keeping the retained value above my outside offer. Let's calculate some feasible allocations.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - First, let's calculate the entire value of all items if I keep them all: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Total value} = (5 \\times 44) + (8 \\times 81) + (2 \\times 46) + (4 \\times 89) + (6 \\times 100) \n     \\]\n     \\[\n     = 220 + 648 + 92 + 356 + 600 = 1916\n     \\]\n   - This shows my total value if I were to keep all items.\n   \n   - I want to ensure any starting proposal gives me a total value greater than 1318 due to my outside offer. Additionally, I have to propose a reasonable division of items that might be attractive or acceptable to Player 2.\n\n   - Let's consider a conservative offer to Player 2 that maximizes my value:\n     - Offer [0, 3, 1, 1, 2] to Player 2. This would mean I keep:\n       - 5 of item 1\n       - 5 of item 2\n       - 1 of item 3\n       - 3 of item 4\n       - 4 of item 5\n\n     - Calculate my total retained value:\n       \\[\n       \\text{Value I keep} = (5 \\times 44) + (5 \\times 81) + (1 \\times 46) + (3 \\times 89) + (4 \\times 100) \n       \\]\n       \\[\n       = 220 + 405 + 46 + 267 + 400 = 1338\n       \\]\n   - With this division, my value remains above my outside offer value of 1318.\n\n   This proposal will be my initial offer since it keeps my value just above my outside offer while also giving Player 2 a significant share of some high-value items like item 2 and item 5.\n\n**Decision:**  \nMy action: {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 1, 1, 2]}",

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Your value would be:\n    59 x 0 + 2 x 1 + 83 x 2 + 55 x 0 + 60 x 1\n    which is 228 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 229. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 229\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 59, Item 2: 2, Item 3: 83, Item 4: 55, Item 5: 60\n*   **Total item pool:** Item 1: 3, Item 2: 1, Item 3: 7, Item 4: 2, Item 5: 1\n*   **Discount factor:** 0.98. This means that accepting an offer later in the game is slightly less valuable than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of the current offer:**\n\n*   **Current offer to me:** [1, 0, 2, 0, 0]\n*   **Items I keep:** Item 1: 3 - 1 = 2, Item 2: 1 - 0 = 1, Item 3: 7 - 2 = 5, Item 4: 2 - 0 = 2, Item 5: 1 - 0 = 1\n*   **Value of items I keep:** (2 \\* 59) + (1 \\* 2) + (5 \\* 83) + (2 \\* 55) + (1 \\* 60) = 118 + 2 + 415 + 110 + 60 = 705\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** 705 > 229. Accepting the current offer is better than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Consider a counteroffer:**\n\nBefore accepting, let's briefly consider if a counteroffer could yield a higher value, considering the discount factor. Let's try to create an offer that gives me just over my outside offer but is possibly more favorable for Player 1 than the current offer. First, let's calculate the total value of all items to me: (3 * 59) + (1 * 2) + (7 * 83) + (2 * 55) + (1 * 60) = 177 + 2 + 581 + 110 + 60 = 930.\n\nI want to offer Player 1 some items that give them slightly more than what they are getting with this offer, and keep some for myself that results in my total value exceeding my outside offer.\n\nSince I have a good offer, let's aim for something simple. Since Player 1 is offering me [1, 0, 2, 0, 0] which has a low total quantity, maybe an offer of [1, 0, 2, 0, 0] from me to them might be accepted, if the value of those items to Player 1 are higher. To make the game end in my favour, let's consider a counter offer more favorable to me.\n\nLet's try offering Player 1 [2, 1, 5, 1, 1]. This leaves me with [1, 0, 2, 1, 0].\nValue to me = 59 * 1 + 2 * 0 + 83 * 2 + 55 * 1 + 60 * 0 = 59 + 0 + 166 + 55 + 0 = 280\nThis is more than my outside offer. The current round is round 1. so discounting does not come into play. If player 1 accepts, I am getting 280, which is more than the outside offer. \n\nIf player 1 rejects, I could accept the current offer and get 705 * 0.98 = 690.9. \n\nSo it makes sense to make the counter offer.\n\n4) **Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer is good, but a carefully chosen counteroffer might yield a higher value in the long run if accepted. Therefore, I will make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 5, 1, 1]}\n```",

Since we're in round 2, the discount applied to the value of this round's outcome is `gamma^(2-1) = 0.98`.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n- **Current Offer on the Table**: [2, 1, 5, 1, 1]\n  - Calculating the Value of the Current Offer:\n    - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 20 = 40\n    - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 50 = 50\n    - 5 units of item 3 = 5 \u00d7 18 = 90\n    - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 51 = 51\n    - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 23 = 23\n\n  - **Total Value**: 40 + 50 + 90 + 51 + 23 = 254\n  - **Discounted Value**: 254 \u00d7 0.98 = 248.92\n\n- **Comparing with Outside Offer**:\n  - Current offer's discounted value (248.92) is greater than the outside offer (165).\n\n### Step 3: Decision Making\nBased on the analysis:\n- The current offer on the table provides a discounted value of 248.92, which is significantly better than my outside offer of 165.\n- Accepting this offer avoids any risk associated with future negotiations, especially with only one more round remaining.\n\nThus, the optimal decision is to ACCEPT the current offer, as it provides a higher value than my outside offer and respects the mistakes outlined.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This means that offers in later rounds are worth slightly less.\n\n2) **Assess the value of the current offer:**\n   - Current offer: [1, 3, 3, 3, 0] (what Player 1 is offering *me*)\n   - My value if I accept: (1 * 27) + (3 * 57) + (3 * 97) + (3 * 100) + (0 * 57) = 27 + 171 + 291 + 300 + 0 = 789\n\n   - Comparison to my outside offer: 789 < 1529.  The current offer is significantly worse than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Consider potential counteroffers:** I need to figure out what division of items I can offer Player 1 such that what I keep is worth more than 1529. Let's start by exploring some potential counteroffers.\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer: I don't have a previous offer.\n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer: I need to avoid this.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items: This seems suboptimal.\n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer: The current offer falls into this trap.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer: I need to determine an offer better than my outside offer.\n\nLet's consider a few different counteroffer strategies. Since Item 4 has the highest value, I want to keep as much of that as possible.\n\nCounteroffer A: Give Player 1 [0, 2, 3, 0, 0]\nI keep [1, 3, 3, 8, 1]\nMy value: (1 * 27) + (3 * 57) + (3 * 97) + (8 * 100) + (1 * 57) = 27 + 171 + 291 + 800 + 57 = 1346. Still less than 1529\n\nCounteroffer B: Give Player 1 [0, 2, 2, 0, 0]\nI keep [1, 3, 4, 8, 1]\nMy value: (1 * 27) + (3 * 57) + (4 * 97) + (8 * 100) + (1 * 57) = 27 + 171 + 388 + 800 + 57 = 1443. Still less than 1529\n\nCounteroffer C: Give Player 1 [0, 1, 1, 0, 0]\nI keep [1, 4, 5, 8, 1]\nMy value: (1 * 27) + (4 * 57) + (5 * 97) + (8 * 100) + (1 * 57) = 27 + 228 + 485 + 800 + 57 = 1597.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 903. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 867 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 1529\n*   My item values: item 1 = 27, item 2 = 57, item 3 = 97, item 4 = 100, item 5 = 57\n*   Total items: item 1 = 1, item 2 = 5, item 3 = 6, item 4 = 8, item 5 = 1\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.98. This means that accepting an offer in round 2 gives me 0.98 times the value of the offer.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 2, 2, 1, 0]. This means I would receive:\n    *   Item 1: 0 units\n    *   Item 2: 2 units\n    *   Item 3: 2 units\n    *   Item 4: 1 units\n    *   Item 5: 0 units\n    My value for this offer is (0 * 27) + (2 * 57) + (2 * 97) + (1 * 100) + (0 * 57) = 0 + 114 + 194 + 100 + 0 = 408\n    Since this is round 2, the discounted value is 408 * 0.98 = 399.84.  This is significantly less than my outside offer of 1529.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than my outside offer of 1529. I also need to consider that it is round 2. Let's start by considering what I would value keeping everything.\n\n    *   Keeping everything: (1 * 27) + (5 * 57) + (6 * 97) + (8 * 100) + (1 * 57) = 27 + 285 + 582 + 800 + 57 = 1751.\n\n    I need to give Player 1 something. Since I am in round 2, I want to make an offer that is good for me and potentially acceptable to Player 1, before the negotiation ends. Let's try to give player 1 only some of item 3 and item 4 to see if there is a possible acceptable offer. If I give all of items 3 and 4 to player 1, then my value is only 27 + 285 + 57 = 369 which is way below my outside offer.\n\nLet's try giving them [0, 3, 4, 6, 0]: I keep [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] for a value of: 27 + 114 + 194 + 200 + 57 = 592. This is terrible for me.\n\nLet's try giving them [0, 1, 1, 0, 0] like I did in round 1. I keep [1, 4, 5, 8, 1] for a value of: 27 + 228 + 485 + 800 + 57 = 1597. The discounted value for this offer is 1597 * 0.98 = 1565.06, which is more than my outside offer of 1529.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Accepting the current offer yields 399.84, which is less than my outside offer.\n*   Walking away yields 1529.\n*   I can make a counteroffer that gives me a discounted value of 1565.06, which is greater than walking away.\n\nTherefore, I should make the counteroffer [0, 1, 1, 0, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 1, 0, 0]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and decide on the best action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value is 156.\n*   My values for the items are: item 1 = 62, item 2 = 1, item 3 = 74, item 4 = 52, item 5 = 3.\n*   The total pool of items is: 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5.\n*   The discount factor is 0.98. This means that accepting an offer in later rounds is slightly less valuable than accepting it now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]. This means I would receive 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n    *   Value of current offer: (1 * 62) + (1 * 1) + (0 * 74) + (0 * 52) + (0 * 3) = 62 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 63\n*   63 is less than my outside offer of 156. Accepting this offer would be a mistake.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to calculate what I would get to keep if I make a counteroffer.\n    Here are some possible counteroffers to consider:\n\n    * Counteroffer [0,0,0,0,0]: My value = 4 * 62 + 4 * 1 + 2 * 74 + 4 * 52 + 4 * 3 = 248 + 4 + 148 + 208 + 12 = 620. This is a great offer, but player 1 would likely reject it.\n\n    * Counteroffer [4, 4, 2, 4, 4]: My value = 0. This is a terrible offer.\n\n    * Counteroffer [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]: My value = 3 * 62 + 3 * 1 + 1 * 74 + 3 * 52 + 3 * 3 = 186 + 3 + 74 + 156 + 9 = 428. Player 1 would receive a value of 1 * v1 + 1 * v2 + 1 * v3 + 1 * v4 + 1 * v5 (where v1 to v5 are Player 1's item values).\n\n    * Consider a counteroffer where I keep all of item 3 (my highest value item) and a few of the other items, keeping the remaining for Player 1: [4, 4, 0, 4, 4]. Then the value for me is 0*62 + 0*1 + 2*74 + 0*52 + 0*3 = 148. That's not great, but if I add in more Item 4, the value improves:\n\n    * Counteroffer [4,4,0,0,4]: My value is 208 + 148 = 356\n* Counteroffer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] implies the current round offer is not great and Player 1 offered near nothing.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer of 63 is much less than my outside offer of 156. I should not accept.\n*   I should not walk away immediately, as there are potentially beneficial deals to be made. I should make a counteroffer.\n*   My goal is to obtain a value that is better than 156.\n\nGiven that Player 1 started with a very poor offer, I should try to aim high in my counteroffer and expect some negotiation. A counteroffer of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] would be ideal, yielding me a value of 620. A reasonable starting point would be splitting each item evenly at the start.\n\nTherefore, I will make a counteroffer to Player 1, giving them [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```",

                    "response": "Let's walk through the step-by-step analysis to determine the optimal action.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n- **Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer value is 697.\n- **Values of the Items**:\n  - Item 1: 4 per unit\n  - Item 2: 51 per unit\n  - Item 3: 22 per unit\n  - Item 4: 25 per unit\n  - Item 5: 62 per unit\n- **Total Pool of Items**: \n  - Item 1: 4 units\n  - Item 2: 6 units\n  - Item 3: 0 units\n  - Item 4: 3 units\n  - Item 5: 5 units\n- **Discount Factor Influence**: With a discount factor of 0.98, the value decreases slightly with each round. This means that delaying the negotiation to the following rounds (especially round 3) will slightly reduce the value for both players. However, in round 1, the full value is unaffected (since \\(\\gamma^{0} = 1\\)).\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n- **Current Offer**: There is no current offer from Player 2 to evaluate.\n- **Potential Counteroffers**: \n  - I need to consider proposing a division of items that maximizes my value and is better than my outside offer.\n  - My total value for keeping everything would be:\n    - 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 4 = 16\n    - 6 units of item 2 = 6 \u00d7 51 = 306\n    - 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 22 = 0\n    - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75\n    - 5 units of item 5 = 5 \u00d7 62 = 310\n    - **Total Value for keeping all items = 707**\n\nGiven this setup, my outside offer (697) is very close to my full value if I kept all items (707). I need to ensure any counteroffer leaves me with at least a value of 697 to avoid falling below the outside offer.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n- Since this is round 1 and there's no current offer to accept, I will propose a counteroffer with a division that maintains my value at least as high as my outside offer.\n- I will try to propose a split that gives Player 2 some value but keeps my value above 697.\n\n### Propose a Counteroffer\nKeeping a high-value item like item 5 for myself while distributing some of the lower-value items can be strategic. I'll try the following counteroffer:\n\n1. Offer the following to Player 2:\n   - 3 units of item 1 (keeping 1)\n   - 2 units of item 2 (keeping 4)\n   - 0 units of item 3 (none to distribute)\n   - 1 units of item 4 (keeping 2)\n   - 2 units of item 5 (keeping 3)\n\nCalculating my retained value:\n- My units:\n  - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 4 = 4\n  - 4 units of item 2 = 4 \u00d7 51 = 204\n  - 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 22 = 0\n  - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 25 = 50\n  - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186\n- **Total Value Retained = 444**\n\nThis is below my outside offer value of 697, so this offer won't work. To ensure my proposal is valid, let's adjust to maximize my retention.\n\nInstead, let's retain more units, aiming for a new counteroffer:\n\nOffer the following to Player 2:\n- 2 units of item 1 (keeping 2)\n- 1 unit of item 2 (keeping 5)\n- 0 units of item 3\n- 1 unit of item 4 (keeping 2)\n- 1 units of item 5 (keeping 4)\n\nRecalculate my retained value:\n- My units:\n  - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 4 = 8\n  - 5 units of item 2 = 5 \u00d7 51 = 255\n  - 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 22 = 0\n  - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 25 = 50\n  - 4 units of item 5 = 4 \u00d7 62 = 248\n- **Total Value Retained = 561**\n\nIt appears that even by keeping the majority of high-value items, I am unable to achieve 697 retention simply using raw item holding without considering an agreement. Recognizing this, better approaches before deciding might be reevaluating calculation errors or negotiating conditions. SHould further steps be needed or new offers reevaluated, follow up. In conclusion, initial broad distribution ensured reaching the 697 quantity would require extreme tactic or opponent error. Given initial context limit, unable maximize to desired negotiation closure.\n\n**The decision for action:**\n\nI might revise alternatively: retesting scenarios where realistic expectations will create a better baseline assumption for next rounds, hinting alternate gain achieving full degree terms as previous item tweaks maintain~1. Now complete to decide:\n- {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 0, 1, 1]} \n\nHope valid, accountals seems slight margin tapered unless substantial item redistribution hit.",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items.

This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 0, 0, 2, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    36 x 4 + 5 x 0 + 25 x 0 + 66 x 2 + 89 x 5\n    which is 721 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 722. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

This means accepting an offer later is slightly less valuable than accepting it now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer:** I am being offered [2, 1, 0, 1, 1].\n      - My value from this offer is (2 * 36) + (1 * 5) + (0 * 25) + (1 * 66) + (1 * 89) = 72 + 5 + 0 + 66 + 89 = 232.\n      - If I accept this offer, my value is 232.\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what I would keep and what I would offer Player 1. I need to make sure the value I keep is greater than 722.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   - The current offer is worth 232, which is much lower than my outside offer of 722. Therefore, I should not accept it.\n   - I could walk away and receive 722.\n   - Or, I can make a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 722.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer. I want to keep most of the valuable items (items 4 and 5). Let's try offering Player 1 the following: [2, 5, 0, 0, 0].

                    "response": "Let's carefully evaluate the current situation and make a calculated decision.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the current situation\n\n- **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 697.\n- **Values of Items:**\n  - Item 1: 4\n  - Item 2: 51\n  - Item 3: 22\n  - Item 4: 25\n  - Item 5: 62\n- **Total Pool of Items:**\n  - 4 units of item 1\n  - 6 units of item 2\n  - 0 units of item 3\n  - 3 units of item 4\n  - 5 units of item 5\n- **Discount Factor:** The discount factor, gamma, is 0.98. Since it's round 2, the value of any outcome is multiplied by \\(0.98^1 = 0.98\\).\n\n### Step 2: Assess the value of offers\n\n- **Current Offer Value (if I accept):**\n  - 0 units of item 1: \\(0 \\times 4 = 0\\)\n  - 6 units of item 2: \\(6 \\times 51 = 306\\)\n  - 0 units of item 3: \\(0 \\times 22 = 0\\)\n  - 0 units of item 4: \\(0 \\times 25 = 0\\)\n  - 0 units of item 5: \\(0 \\times 62 = 0\\)\n  - Total unadjusted value = 306\n  - Adjusted value considering discount = \\(306 \\times 0.98 = 299.88\\)\n\nThe current offer gives me a value of 299.88, which is significantly lower than my outside offer value of 697.\n\n- **Value of potential counteroffers:** \n  Since my outside offer is 697, any counteroffer I make must ensure that my value is above this, taking into account the discount factor.\n\nGiven this, the most valuable items to me are:\n  - Item 5: High value per unit of 62.\n  - Item 2: High value per unit of 51.\n\nTo maximize my value, I should focus on retaining as much of these items as possible.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\n- **Should I Accept the Current Offer?**\n  No, because its value (299.88) is less than my outside offer (697).\n\n- **Should I Walk Away?**\n  Walking gives me a guaranteed value of 697.\n\n- **Propose a Specific Counteroffer:**\n  If I can propose a counteroffer where I retain most or all of high-value items 2 and 5 without reducing the offer below my outside offer, I might get a better deal.\n\nA reasonable counteroffer might be to offer:\n- 2 units of item 1\n- 2 units of item 2\n- 0 units of item 3\n- 1 unit of item 4\n- 1 unit of item 5\n\nCalculating my value for this counteroffer:\n- Kept for myself:\n  - 2 units of item 1: \\(2 \\times 4 = 8\\)\n  - 4 units of item 2: \\(4 \\times 51 = 204\\)\n  - 0 units of item 3: \\(0 \\times 22 = 0\\)\n  - 2 units of item 4: \\(2 \\times 25 = 50\\)\n  - 4 units of item 5: \\(4 \\times 62 = 248\\)\n- Total unadjusted value = 510\n- Adjusted value with discount = \\(510 \\times 0.98 = 499.8\\)\n\nThe value of this offer (499.8) does not meet my outside option, so proposing it may not be my best move. However, given that offering all items 2 and a portion of item 5 greatly diminishes what I keep, this is a strategic attempt to advance in negotiations should I still consider walking away, as the optimal move.\n\nThus, given that no acceptable counteroffer guarantees a higher payoff than my outside offer:\n\n**Decision:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

This means that delaying an agreement to later rounds slightly reduces the value of that agreement to both parties, as it is multiplied by 0.98^(r-1), where r is the round.\n\n### 2) Assess the value of offers:\n\n- **Current Offer:** Since there is no current offer, I am the first to propose an initial offer.\n\n- **My Total Value of All Items:** It's important to know the total value of all items as it represents the maximum value I could theoretically receive if I kept everything:\n  \\[\n  (5 \\times 1) + (4 \\times 8) + (8 \\times 21) + (3 \\times 67) + (3 \\times 14) = 448\n  \\]\n\n- **Comparison to Outside Offer:** My outside offer value is 5, which is very low compared to the total value.\n\nTo make an initial offer, I want to ensure that my offer is more beneficial than simply accepting my outside offer. Additionally, enticing Player 2 to accept quickly may be beneficial given the discount factor.\n\n### 3) Make an initial offer decision:\n\n- **Propose a Fair Initial Offer:** Since this is the first round, I want to make an offer that is reasonable for both players. A potential fair starting point is dividing items roughly in halves, while keeping my interests in mind, especially in the higher value items.\n\n- **Initial Counteroffer Strategy:**\n  - Offer Player 2 less of the high-value items and more of the lower value items where possible.\n\nLet's propose:\n- Give Player 2: \n   - 3 units of item 1\n   - 2 units of item 2\n   - 4 units of item 3\n   - 1 unit of item 4\n   - 1 unit of item 5 \n\nThis offer means I keep:\n- 2 units of item 1: \\(2 \\times 1 = 2\\)\n- 2 units of item 2: \\(2 \\times 8 = 16\\)\n- 4 units of item 3: \\(4 \\times 21 = 84\\)\n- 2 units of item 4: \\(2 \\times 67 = 134\\)\n- 2 units of item 5: \\(2 \\times 14 = 28\\)\n\n**Total own value:**\n\\[\n2 + 16 + 84 + 134 + 28 = 264\n\\]\n\nThis value is much higher than my outside offer, and it's reasonable to assume that Player 2 has similar strategic interests. This offer avoids mistake 2 and gives me a very good outcome while also leaving room for negotiations.\n\n### Conclusion\nWith this in mind, my initial action will be to propose this division:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 2, 4, 1, 1]}\n```",

This means waiting one round multiplies the value by 0.98.\n\n2. **Assess the value of the current offer:**\n   - Current offer to me: [3, 2, 4, 1, 1]\n   - This means Player 1 is giving me 3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n   - My value if I accept:\n     (3 * 87) + (2 * 12) + (4 * 84) + (1 * 45) + (1 * 68) = 261 + 24 + 336 + 45 + 68 = 734\n\n3. **Compare to my outside offer:**\n   - My value if I accept the current offer: 734\n   - My outside offer value: 882\n   - Since 734 < 882, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\n4. **Consider a counteroffer:**\n   - I want to make a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer for me.\n   - I currently have: 5 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 8 of item 3, 3 of item 4, and 3 of item 5.\n\nLet's calculate a potential counteroffer. How about I offer Player 1 2 units of item 1, 2 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 2 of item 4, and 2 of item 5. This means I would keep 3 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 1 of item 5. My value would be:\n\n(3 * 87) + (2 * 12) + (4 * 84) + (1 * 45) + (1 * 68) = 261 + 24 + 336 + 45 + 68 = 734\n\nThis is the same as the current offer. Since that is less than my outside offer, let's improve it. Let's keep everything.\n\nOffer [0,0,0,0,0] to Player 1.\nMy value is then:\n(5 * 87) + (4 * 12) + (8 * 84) + (3 * 45) + (3 * 68) = 435 + 48 + 672 + 135 + 204 = 1494\n\nSince 1494 > 882, it is better to offer player 1 [0,0,0,0,0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 5. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 333 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

This is the guaranteed value I would receive if the negotiation ends without a deal.\n  \n- **Values of the Items**: \n  - Item 1: 1 per unit\n  - Item 2: 8 per unit\n  - Item 3: 21 per unit\n  - Item 4: 67 per unit\n  - Item 5: 14 per unit\n  \n- **Total Pool of Items**: \n  - 5 units of item 1\n  - 4 units of item 2\n  - 8 units of item 3\n  - 3 units of item 4\n  - 3 units of item 5\n  \n- **Discount Factor Influence**: Since this is round 3, if we agree on a division, the value is multiplied by \\( \\gamma^{2} = 0.98^2 \\approx 0.9604 \\). This discount factor decreases the value of future offers, so accepting an offer now is more valuable than in round 2.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer [5, 4, 0, 0, 0]**:\n  - Total value if I accept:\n    - 5 units of item 1: 5 \u00d7 1 = 5\n    - 4 units of item 2: 4 \u00d7 8 = 32\n    - 0 units of item 3: 0 \u00d7 21 = 0\n    - 0 units of item 4: 0 \u00d7 67 = 0\n    - 0 units of item 5: 0 \u00d7 14 = 0\n    - Total Value = 5 + 32 = 37\n  - Discounted Total Value = 37 \u00d7 0.9604 = 35.49\n\n- **Comparison of Offers**:\n  - The current offer with a discounted total value of 35.49 is significantly higher than my outside offer of 5.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision Based on the Analysis\n\n- **Decision**: \n  - The current offer provides a substantially higher value (35.49) compared to my outside offer (5).\n  - It makes sense to accept the current offer rather than walking away or making a new counteroffer since I cannot guarantee a better outcome on my own, and proposing a new offer would be treated as a WALK in this round.\n\nBased on the above analysis, I will accept the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

For example, if an offer is accepted in round 2, its value is multiplied by 0.98.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n- **Current Offer**: No offer is currently on the table.\n- **Potential Counteroffers**: We need to propose a division of items that maximizes our value but also considers what Player 2 might accept.\n\nLet's analyze a few potential counteroffers:\n1. **Offer 1**: Give Player 2 [1, 1, 2, 1, 3]\n   - My Share: [5 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 3 units of item 5]\n   - My Value: 5 \u00d7 85 + 1 \u00d7 97 + 2 \u00d7 81 + 1 \u00d7 66 + 3 \u00d7 66 = 1188\n\n2. **Offer 2**: Give Player 2 [2, 1, 1, 0, 3]\n   - My Share: [4 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5]\n   - My Value: 4 \u00d7 85 + 1 \u00d7 97 + 3 \u00d7 81 + 2 \u00d7 66 + 3 \u00d7 66 = 1118\n\n3. **Offer 3**: Give Player 2 [3, 1, 1, 1, 2]\n   - My Share: [3 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 4 units of item 5]\n   - My Value: 3 \u00d7 85 + 1 \u00d7 97 + 3 \u00d7 81 + 1 \u00d7 66 + 4 \u00d7 66 = 1052\n\nAll of these potential offers provide me with a value greater than my outside offer of 879.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\nConsidering that there are no current offers from Player 2 and we are in the initial round, I am in a position to make a counteroffer. To maximize my value while still proposing a reasonable offer for Player 2, I will select the offer that maximizes my value while leaving some room for negotiation in future rounds.

Therefore, I should not ACCEPT.\n\nI will consider making a counteroffer.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 879. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1185 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 2, 1, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [2, 2, 0, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 2, 0, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "In round 3, we need to evaluate the current situation and decide on the best action. Let's go through the step-by-step analysis:\n\n### 1) Analyze the current situation:\n\n- **Outside offer value**: Your outside offer is worth 879.\n  \n- **Values of the items involved**:\n  - Item 1: 85 per unit\n  - Item 2: 97 per unit\n  - Item 3: 81 per unit\n  - Item 4: 66 per unit\n  - Item 5: 66 per unit\n\n- **Total pool of items**:\n  - 6 units of item 1\n  - 2 units of item 2\n  - 4 units of item 3\n  - 2 units of item 4\n  - 6 units of item 5\n\n- **Discount factor**: The discounted value of a round 3 decision (last round offer) is simply the nominal value, as there\u2019s no future round factor to consider.\n\n### 2) Assess the value of offers:\n\n- **Current offer**: [2, 2, 0, 2, 0]\n  - Value calculation:\n    - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 85 = 170\n    - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 97 = 194\n    - 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 81 = 0\n    - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 66 = 132\n    - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 66 = 0\n  - Total value = 170 + 194 + 132 = 496\n\nThe current offer value to you is 496, which is lower than your outside offer value of 879.\n\n### 3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n\n- **Accept the current offer**: The current offer gives you a value of 496, which is worse than your outside offer value of 879. Accepting this would be a mistake 4.\n- **Walk away**: Your outside offer has a value of 879.\n- **Propose a counteroffer**: As it's the last round, Player 2 cannot make a counteroffer. The best strategy is either to accept or walk away, since any counteroffer effectively acts as a walk.\n\nGiven the analysis, the current offer is considerably lower than the outside offer. Thus, the optimal decision is to walk away, ensuring a guaranteed value of 879 with the outside offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

This is my guaranteed fallback if the negotiation does not result in a better deal.\n- **Values of the items**: My private values per unit for each item are:\n  - Item 1: 28\n  - Item 2: 67\n  - Item 3: 68\n  - Item 4: 90\n  - Item 5: 21\n- **Total pool of items**: There are:\n  - 5 units of item 1\n  - 5 units of item 2\n  - 4 units of item 3\n  - 4 units of item 4\n  - 1 unit of item 5\n- **Discount factor**: The discount factor, gamma, is 0.98. This means the value of offers decreases slightly in future rounds, as it is multiplied by the discount factor raised to the power of the number of rounds minus one.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the value of offers\n\n- **Current offer value**: As there is currently no offer, I have nothing to accept.\n\n- **Potential counteroffers**: To choose a counteroffer, I need to ensure the value of items I retain exceeds my outside offer value (150). Let's consider a simple offer where I keep a significant portion of the items.\n\n  **Proposal:**\n  - Give Player 2: \n    - 2 units of item 1\n    - 2 units of item 2\n    - 2 units of item 3\n    - 2 units of item 4\n    - 0 units of item 5\n\n  **Value Calculation (for me):**\n  - Retain 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 28 = 84\n  - Retain 3 units of item 2: 3 \u00d7 67 = 201\n  - Retain 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 68 = 136\n  - Retain 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 90 = 180\n  - Retain 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 21 = 21\n  - Total value = 84 + 201 + 136 + 180 + 21 = 622\n\n- **Comparison**: The total value of the items I am retaining (622) is significantly higher than my outside offer value (150), so this offer is better for me.\n\n### Step 3: Make a decision\n\nSince there is no current offer to accept, and my initial proposal ensures that I retain enough value from the items, I will make a counteroffer.

Your value would be:\n    63 x 0 + 17 x 0 + 29 x 4 + 46 x 0 + 21 x 1\n    which is 137 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 138. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 2, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 2, 2, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 138\n*   **Item values:** Item 1: 63, Item 2: 17, Item 3: 29, Item 4: 46, Item 5: 21\n*   **Total items:** Item 1: 5, Item 2: 5, Item 3: 4, Item 4: 4, Item 5: 1\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.98. This means that an offer accepted in a later round is worth slightly less than the same offer accepted now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [2, 2, 2, 2, 0]. This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 5 - 2 = 3\n    *   Item 2: 5 - 2 = 3\n    *   Item 3: 4 - 2 = 2\n    *   Item 4: 4 - 2 = 2\n    *   Item 5: 1 - 0 = 1\n    My value if I accept is: (3 * 63) + (3 * 17) + (2 * 29) + (2 * 46) + (1 * 21) = 189 + 51 + 58 + 92 + 21 = 411\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** 411 > 138. Accepting the current offer is much better than walking away.\n\n3) **Consider a counteroffer:**\nSince the current offer is significantly better than my outside offer, I don't need to make a counteroffer to reach my goal. However, for the sake of analysis, let's consider a possible counteroffer where I keep all of item 1, item 3 and item 4 and give the remaining items to the other player.\nCounteroffer to Player 1: [0, 5, 0, 0, 1]\nMy value would be: (5 * 63) + (0 * 17) + (4 * 29) + (4 * 46) + (0 * 21) = 315 + 0 + 116 + 184 + 0 = 615\nThis offer is better for me, however, the other player might reject this.

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 428. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 428. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 573 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

For example, an offer accepted in round 2 would be multiplied by 0.98, and in round 3 by 0.98\u00b2.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - There is no current offer for you to assess.\n   - Calculate your total value if you were to keep all items:\n     - (2 \u00d7 28) + (1 \u00d7 38) + (3 \u00d7 7) + (4 \u00d7 37) + (5 \u00d7 81) = 56 + 38 + 21 + 148 + 405 = 668.\n   - You want to ensure that your division of the items results in a value to you greater than your outside offer (428).\n\n3) Initial Offer Decision:\n   - You need to propose a division of items that maximizes your value but also has a reasonable chance of being accepted by Player 2.\n   - Consider offering the following [n1, n2, n3, n4, n5] where ni represents the number of units of item i offered to Player 2. Based on your private values, you should aim to keep more of the high-value items (especially item 5).\n\nHere's a potential initial counteroffer approach:\n\n- You value item 5 very highly, so aim to keep most of it:\n  - Offer: 1 unit of Item 1, 1 unit of Item 2, 2 units of Item 3, 2 units of Item 4, and 1 unit of Item 5.\n- Your perceived value with this offer would be:\n  - Item 1: 1 unit \u00d7 28 = 28\n  - Item 2: 0 units \u00d7 38 = 0 (you receive 0, offering 1 to them)\n  - Item 3: 1 unit \u00d7 7 = 7\n  - Item 4: 2 units \u00d7 37 = 74\n  - Item 5: 4 units \u00d7 81 = 324 \n  - Total value = 28 + 0 + 7 + 74 + 324 = 433\n\nThis value (433) is slightly above your outside offer.

This means future offers are a little less valuable, but in the first round, the full value is considered.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer**: No offer on the table at the moment.\n- **Potential Counteroffers**: We need to fashion an offer such that my share, computed using my private values, is greater than or equal to my outside offer (841), while also being reasonable enough for Player 2 to consider accepting in subsequent rounds.\n\n  Let's consider keeping combinations that ensure my total value is greater than 841.\n\n  **Example Offer Split:**\n  - Keep 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 83 = 249\n  - Keep 3 units of item 2: 3 \u00d7 65 = 195\n  - Keep 3 units of item 3: 3 \u00d7 88 = 264\n  - Keep 8 units of item 4: 8 \u00d7 61 = 488\n  - Keep 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 1 = 1\n\n  Total = 249 + 195 + 264 + 488 + 1 = 1197 (greater than 841)\n\n  This means offering Player 2 the following:\n  - 1 unit of item 1\n  - 1 unit of item 2\n  - 1 unit of item 3\n  - 1 unit of item 4\n  - 2 units of item 5\n\n  That gives Player 2 a small immediate share while ensuring my total is significantly higher than my outside offer.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nGiven this analysis, I will proceed with a counteroffer that ensures my value is greater than my outside offer and is reasonable enough to engage Player 2 who might negotiate further or accept in the next rounds.\n\n**Action**:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 2]}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 5, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    93 x 0 + 76 x 0 + 31 x 0 + 2 x 5 + 85 x 2\n    which is 180 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 181. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value is 181.\n*   My values for the items are: item 1 = 93, item 2 = 76, item 3 = 31, item 4 = 2, item 5 = 85.\n*   The total pool of items is: 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 9 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5.\n*   The discount factor is 0.98. This means that accepting an offer in a later round is slightly less valuable than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 1, 1, 1, 2]. This means I would receive:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 93 = 93\n    *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 76 = 76\n    *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 31 = 31\n    *   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 2 = 2\n    *   2 unit of item 5: 2 * 85 = 170\n    *   Total value of current offer: 93 + 76 + 31 + 2 + 170 = 372\n*   **Compare to outside offer:** The current offer (372) is significantly better than my outside offer (181).\n\n3) **Consider a counteroffer:**\nIf I accept the current offer I will get a value of 372. This is much better than my outside option of 181.\nLet's consider a potential counteroffer. I want to maximize my value, so I want to keep items that I value highly. Let's try offering Player 1 only item 4 and only 1 unit. I would offer [0, 0, 0, 1, 0].\n\n*   This means I would keep:\n    *   4 units of item 1: 4 * 93 = 372\n    *   4 units of item 2: 4 * 76 = 304\n    *   4 units of item 3: 4 * 31 = 124\n    *   8 units of item 4: 8 * 2 = 16\n    *   3 units of item 5: 3 * 85 = 255\n    *   Total value: 372 + 304 + 124 + 16 + 255 = 1071\nIf I make this offer, and it gets rejected, then in round 2 my outside option would be discounted to 181 * 0.98 = 177.38. However, since the current offer is so good, it is unlikely that any counteroffer will make me better off given the high risk of rejection. Therefore, I will accept the current offer.\n\nDecision: The current offer is significantly better than my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

Accepting a deal earlier is more advantageous because delaying an agreement decreases its present value due to the discount factor.\n   - Since this is round 1, no discount is applied yet.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step to determine the best course of action.\n\n1. **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n   - My outside offer value: 732\n   - Values of the items: Item 1: 82, Item 2: 85, Item 3: 31, Item 4: 87, Item 5: 6\n   - Total pool of items: 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 7 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5.\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.98. This means that accepting an offer later will be slightly less valuable.\n\n2. **Assess the value of the current offer:**\n\n   - Current offer: [1, 1, 3, 4, 1] (This means I receive 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5).\n   - Value of the current offer: (1 * 82) + (1 * 85) + (3 * 31) + (4 * 87) + (1 * 6) = 82 + 85 + 93 + 348 + 6 = 614\n   - Comparing to my outside offer: 614 < 732\n\n3. **Consider a counteroffer:**\n\n    I need to propose an offer where I receive a value greater than 732. The total amount of each item is: 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 7 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5.\n\n    Let's try to find an offer that gives me a value just above 732. I should prioritize keeping items with high values (item 4, item 2, item 1).\n\n    Let's propose that I keep: 3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n    This translates to offering Player 1: 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n    My value for this division: (3 * 82) + (2 * 85) + (1 * 31) + (3 * 87) + (3 * 6) = 246 + 170 + 31 + 261 + 18 = 726. This is still lower than 732.\n\n    Let's try: 4 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n    This translates to offering Player 1: 0 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n    My value for this division: (4 * 82) + (2 * 85) + (1 * 31) + (2 * 87) + (3 * 6) = 328 + 170 + 31 + 174 + 18 = 721. This is still lower than 732.\n\n    Let's try: 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 0 unit of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n    This translates to offering Player 1: 1 unit of item 1, 0 unit of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n    My value for this division: (3 * 82) + (3 * 85) + (0 * 31) + (2 * 87) + (3 * 6) = 246 + 255 + 0 + 174 + 18 = 693. This is still lower than 732.\n\n    Let's try: 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 0 unit of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n    This translates to offering Player 1: 0 unit of item 1, 0 unit of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n    My value for this division: (4 * 82) + (3 * 85) + (0 * 31) + (2 * 87) + (3 * 6) = 328 + 255 + 0 + 174 + 18 = 775.\n\n    This counteroffer of [0, 0, 4, 5, 1] to Player 1 would give me a value of 775, which is higher than my outside offer.\n\n4. **Make a decision:**\n\n   The current offer gives me a value of 614, which is worse than my outside offer of 732. I will propose a counteroffer that gives me a value of 775, which is better than my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 4, 5, 1]}\n```",

It incentivizes reaching a deal sooner rather than later, as the value of a deal decreases with each passing round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - Since there's no current offer on the table for me, I can't evaluate the total value of accepting an offer.\n   \n   - **For potential counteroffers:**\n     I need to propose a division that maximizes my value while being better than my outside offer of 199.\n\n     Let's consider various divisions and calculate their total value to me:\n     \n     - Keep all items for myself:\n       - Total value: \n         \\[\n         (0 \\times 89) + (6 \\times 15) + (4 \\times 59) + (5 \\times 72) + (3 \\times 80) = 90 + 236 + 360 + 240 = 926\n         \\]\n       - This isn't a realistic proposal since we should aim for a fair division.\n\n     - Keep the majority but offer some items to Player 2:\n       Example Proposal: Offer Player 2-- 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5.\n       \n       - Value for me:\n         - Item 2: \\(3 \\times 15 = 45\\)\n         - Item 3: \\(2 \\times 59 = 118\\)\n         - Item 4: \\(3 \\times 72 = 216\\)\n         - Item 5: \\(2 \\times 80 = 160\\)\n         - Total Value = 45 + 118 + 216 + 160 = 539\n  \n   - This is greater than my outside offer of 199.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   \n   - Since my calculated value from this setup (539) is greater than my outside offer (199), and also it does not trivialize the player's options (by offering nothing or everything), I avoid all the mistakes listed.\n   \n   - Therefore, a sound strategy would be to propose this division as a counteroffer.\n\nGiven this analysis, my decision is:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 2, 2, 1]}\n```",

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 697. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 600 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

This means that accepting an offer in a later round is slightly less valuable than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of the current offer:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am offered [0, 3, 1, 2, 2]. This means I get 0 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.  Player 1 would then receive [3, 1, 4, 1, 3].\n*   **My value if I accept:** (0 \\* 88) + (3 \\* 47) + (1 \\* 92) + (2 \\* 22) + (2 \\* 14) = 0 + 141 + 92 + 44 + 28 = 305\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** 305 < 414. Accepting this offer is worse than walking away and taking my outside offer.\n\n3) **Consider a counteroffer:**\nI need to find an offer that gives me a value greater than 414.\n\nLet's start by calculating the total value of all the items to me:\n(3 \\* 88) + (4 \\* 47) + (5 \\* 92) + (3 \\* 22) + (5 \\* 14) = 264 + 188 + 460 + 66 + 70 = 1048.\n\nThis means I can't make a mistake of type 2, because the most i can give is 1048 which is always greater than 414.\nNow, I need to formulate a counteroffer. I'll start by giving Player 1 a relatively small amount and see where that leaves me. I'll propose giving Player 1 [1, 1, 1, 1, 1].\n\nThis means I keep [2, 3, 4, 2, 4]. My value for this is:\n(2 \\* 88) + (3 \\* 47) + (4 \\* 92) + (2 \\* 22) + (4 \\* 14) = 176 + 141 + 368 + 44 + 56 = 785.  This is greater than my outside offer, so it's a valid counteroffer.\n\nNow, I'm ready to make my decision.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 697. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 600 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 3, 1, 2, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\n### 1) Analyze the current situation:\n\n- **My outside offer value:** 697\n- **Values of the items:**\n  - Item 1: 5\n  - Item 2: 18\n  - Item 3: 87\n  - Item 4: 28\n  - Item 5: 62\n- **Total pool of items:**\n  - Item 1: 3 units\n  - Item 2: 4 units\n  - Item 3: 5 units\n  - Item 4: 3 units\n  - Item 5: 5 units\n- **Discount factor influence:** Given that we are in round 2 with a discount factor of 0.98, the value I receive from any accepted offer would be multiplied by \\(0.98^{2-1} = 0.98\\). Therefore, any potential offer needs to be evaluated with this discount rate in mind. The value from an accepted offer will be slightly less than its face value due to this discounting.\n\n### 2) Assess the value of offers:\n\n- **Current Offer:** [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n  - Value to me:\n    - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 5 = 5\n    - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 18 = 18\n    - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 87 = 87\n    - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 28 = 28\n    - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 62 = 62\n  - Total value = 5 + 18 + 87 + 28 + 62 = 200\n  - Discounted value = 200 \u00d7 0.98 = 196\n\n- **Comparison to my outside offer:** 196 (discounted current offer value) vs. 697 (outside offer). Since 196 is much lower than my guaranteed outside offer of 697, this offer is not acceptable.\n\n- **Potential counteroffers:** My goal is to at least match my outside offer with the discounted value in negotiations, or exceed it.\n\n### 3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n\n- **Accept the current offer?** No, as the discounted value of 196 is much less than my outside offer of 697.\n- **Walk away and take my outside offer?** This ensures a value of 697, which is better than the current offer.\n- **Propose a specific counteroffer?** I should attempt to make a counteroffer that maximizes value to me, keeping in mind the outside offer value.\n\nLet's propose a counteroffer that seeks to maximize my value while ensuring the other player might still consider it viable. A possible counteroffer could be to take more high-value items for myself. Here\u2019s a counteroffer for me to consider:\n\n- Offer Player 2: [1, 1, 0, 2, 2]\n  - My retained items:\n    - Item 1: 2 units = 2 \u00d7 5 = 10\n    - Item 2: 3 units = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54\n    - Item 3: 5 units = 5 \u00d7 87 = 435\n    - Item 4: 1 unit = 1 \u00d7 28 = 28\n    - Item 5: 3 units = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186\n  - My total value = 713\n  - Discounted value = 713 \u00d7 0.98 = 698.74\n\nThis counteroffer, if accepted, would exceed my outside offer value even after discounting.\n\nGiven the analysis, I will make a counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 2, 2]}\n```",

Your value would be:\n    88 x 1 + 47 x 1 + 92 x 2 + 22 x 3 + 14 x 2\n    which is 413 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 414.

This means that accepting an offer in round 2 yields 0.98 times the value of that offer, and accepting in round 3 yields 0.98^2 times the value.\n\n2. **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 1, 0, 2, 2]. This means I would receive:\n     - 1 unit of item 1: 1 * 88 = 88\n     - 1 unit of item 2: 1 * 47 = 47\n     - 0 units of item 3: 0 * 92 = 0\n     - 2 units of item 4: 2 * 22 = 44\n     - 2 units of item 5: 2 * 14 = 28\n     - Total value of current offer: 88 + 47 + 0 + 44 + 28 = 207\n     - Discounted value of current offer: 207 * 0.98 = 202.86.

I must leave Player 1 with at least something. Let's start by seeing if I can improve upon their prior offer to me.\n\n   Here's an attempt to create a counteroffer that is better than the outside offer:\n\n   I keep:\n    - 2 units of item 1: 2 * 88 = 176\n    - 3 units of item 2: 3 * 47 = 141\n    - 4 units of item 3: 4 * 92 = 368\n    - 1 unit of item 4: 1 * 22 = 22\n    - 3 units of item 5: 3 * 14 = 42\n    Total value = 176+141+368+22+42 = 749\n    This means offering Player 1: [1, 1, 1, 2, 2]\n   \n\n3. **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   - Accepting the current offer is worse than my outside offer (202.86 < 414), so I will not accept.\n   - Walking away guarantees me 414, which is better than the discounted value of accepting the current offer.\n   - I will propose a counteroffer in an attempt to achieve a better outcome.\n\n   My counteroffer: [1, 1, 1, 2, 2]\n   My retained items: [2, 3, 4, 1, 3]\n   Value: 749\n   Discounted value (at round 3) : 749 * 0.98 = 734.02, which is much greater than my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 2, 2]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Let's break down each step thoroughly:\n\n1) **Analyze the Current Situation:**\n   - **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 1044.\n   - **Values of the Items Involved:**\n     - Item 1: 56 per unit\n     - Item 2: 100 per unit\n     - Item 3: 34 per unit\n     - Item 4: 75 per unit\n     - Item 5: 14 per unit\n   - **Total Pool of Items:**\n     - 5 units of item 1\n     - 4 units of item 2\n     - 2 units of item 3\n     - 6 units of item 4\n     - 4 units of item 5\n   - **Discount Factor:** The discount factor, gamma = 0.98, implies that the longer we negotiate, the present value of any deal decreases. This encourages reaching an agreement sooner rather than later, provided the terms are favorable.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n   - **Current Offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n   - **Potential Counteroffers**:\n     - To devise a beneficial counteroffer, we need to ensure it's more valuable than my outside offer of 1044.\n     - Let's calculate a few potential scenarios:\n       - **Scenario A:** \n         - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168\n         - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 100 = 200\n         - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 34 = 34\n         - 4 units of item 4 = 4 \u00d7 75 = 300\n         - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 14 = 28\n         - Total value to me: 168 + 200 + 34 + 300 + 28 = 730\n\n       - **Scenario B:** \n         - 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 56 = 224\n         - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300\n         - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 34 = 34\n         - 4 units of item 4 = 4 \u00d7 75 = 300\n         - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42\n         - Total value to me: 224 + 300 + 34 + 300 + 42 = 900\n\n       - **Scenario C:** \n         - 5 units of item 1 = 5 \u00d7 56 = 280\n         - 4 units of item 2 = 4 \u00d7 100 = 400\n         - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 34 = 34\n         - 6 units of item 4 = 6 \u00d7 75 = 450\n         - 4 units of item 5 = 4 \u00d7 14 = 56\n         - Total value to me: 280 + 400 + 34 + 450 + 56 = 1220\n\n   Clearly, Scenario C exceeds my outside offer value of 1044. To avoid giving away too much, the ideal starting point is to aim for a strong initial position in the negotiation.\n\n3) **Make a Decision:**\n   - My goal is to propose a counteroffer of Scenario A, knowing it doesn\u2019t exceed my outside offer value but keeps potential negotiation leverage.\n   - If negotiation proceeds unfavorably, Scenario C remains a possible fallback if Player 2 counters with a too-demanding offer.\n\nTherefore, I will propose the following counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 1, 2, 2]}",

This means that an offer accepted in a later round is worth slightly less due to the discount.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am offered [2, 2, 1, 2, 2]. This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 5 - 2 = 3 units. Value = 3 * 56 = 168\n    *   Item 2: 4 - 2 = 2 units. Value = 2 * 65 = 130\n    *   Item 3: 2 - 1 = 1 unit.

Value = 2 * 23 = 46\n    *   Total value of current offer = 168 + 130 + 12 + 300 + 46 = 656\n*   This value (656) is significantly higher than my outside offer (366).\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**  I need to consider if there's a better offer I can make. Since the current offer is already quite good, I need to be careful not to be too greedy and risk the deal falling through.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To make a well-informed decision, let's carefully walk through the steps outlined:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation**:\n   - My outside offer value: 811\n   - My values for each item:\n     - Item 1: 100\n     - Item 2: 98\n     - Item 3: 16\n     - Item 4: 41\n     - Item 5: 37\n   - Total pool of items:\n     - Item 1: 4 units\n     - Item 2: 6 units\n     - Item 3: 5 units\n     - Item 4: 4 units\n     - Item 5: 4 units\n   - Discount factor: In the first round, the discount factor doesn't affect our calculations since \\( \\gamma^{0} = 1 \\). However, as the rounds progress, this factor will reduce the present value of future outcomes.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers**:\n   - There is currently no offer on the table to accept.\n   - We must consider potential counteroffers. A potential counteroffer must be valued above my outside offer of 811. Below are a few different allocation scenarios:\n     - If I offer Player 2:\n       - 0 units of each item, my value = 4\u00d7100 + 6\u00d798 + 5\u00d716 + 4\u00d741 + 4\u00d737 = 1380\n       - 1 unit of each item (keeping the rest), my value = 3\u00d7100 + 5\u00d798 + 4\u00d716 + 3\u00d741 + 3\u00d737 = 1066 (still good)\n       - If I offer more, I must ensure my value remains above 811.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis**:\n   - I can propose a specific counteroffer where my value is significantly greater than my outside offer. For the first round, to ensure a high value, I will consider keeping the bulk of the higher valued items for myself.\n   - I'll propose a counteroffer that still gives me a value far exceeding my outside offer:\n     - Offer Player 2: 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 5\n     - My total value after this offer:\n       - Keeping 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 100 = 400\n       - Keeping 6 units of item 2 = 6 \u00d7 98 = 588\n       - Keeping 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48\n       - Keeping 4 units of item 4 = 4 \u00d7 41 = 164\n       - Keeping 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111\n       - Total value = 1309\n\nSince 1309 is significantly greater than 811, this would be a suitable counteroffer to ensure my payoff exceeds my outside offer value. Thus, I will proceed with this counteroffer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 2, 0, 1]}",

For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 5, 1, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    36 x 0 + 3 x 3 + 37 x 5 + 65 x 1 + 12 x 4\n    which is 307 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 308. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 2, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 2, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step to determine the best action.\n\n1. **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n   - My outside offer value: 308\n   - My item values: Item 1 = 36, Item 2 = 3, Item 3 = 37, Item 4 = 65, Item 5 = 12\n   - Total items: 4 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.98. This means accepting an offer in a later round is worth slightly less than accepting it now.\n\n2. **Assess the value of the current offer:**\n\n   - Current offer to me: [0, 0, 2, 0, 1]\n   - This means I receive 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n   - My value for this offer: (0 * 36) + (0 * 3) + (2 * 37) + (0 * 65) + (1 * 12) = 0 + 0 + 74 + 0 + 12 = 86\n\n3. **Compare to outside offer:**\n\n   - The current offer's value (86) is much less than my outside offer (308).\n\n4. **Consider a counteroffer:** I need to find an offer that gives me a value greater than 308. Let's aim for a simple split.\n    I have 4 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5 in total. I want to give to Player 1 what isn't valuable to me and keep what is. Item 4 has the highest value for me, followed by Item 3, Item 1, Item 5 and then Item 2. So, I will try to keep most of item 4 and item 3, and potentially give more of the other items. Let's try keeping 4 units of Item 4 and 3 units of Item 3, and offer some of the other items. This means offering player 1 [4, 6, 2, 0, 4]\n    \n5. **Calculate value of a counteroffer:**\n    If I offer [4, 6, 2, 0, 4] to player 1, it means I would keep [0, 0, 3, 4, 0]. Value is (0 * 36) + (0 * 3) + (3 * 37) + (4 * 65) + (0 * 12) = 0 + 0 + 111 + 260 + 0 = 371.\n    Since 371 > 308, this is a better offer than my outside option.\n\n6. **Decision:** The current offer is terrible. A counteroffer that allows me to retain items valuable to me (specifically item 4 and item 3) gives me a total value exceeding my outside offer. Therefore, I should make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 6, 2, 0, 4]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 308. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 459 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 5, 1, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    36 x 0 + 3 x 3 + 37 x 5 + 65 x 1 + 12 x 4\n    which is 307 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 308. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 2, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [4, 6, 2, 0, 4]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 5, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 5, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

The discount factor will influence the value of waiting for future offers.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 0, 5, 0, 0]. This means I get 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 5 of item 3, 0 of item 4 and 0 of item 5.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 709. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 744 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This means that accepting an offer in a later round is slightly less valuable than accepting the same offer in an earlier round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]. This means I would receive:\n    *   Item 1: 5 - 0 = 5 units\n    *   Item 2: 2 - 0 = 2 units\n    *   Item 3: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n    *   Item 4: 4 - 1 = 3 units\n    *   Item 5: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n    The value of this offer to me is: (5 * 26) + (2 * 55) + (2 * 67) + (3 * 55) + (2 * 5) = 130 + 110 + 134 + 165 + 10 = 549\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** 549 is much greater than my outside offer of 150.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Since I have a significant advantage by accepting current offer, I will explore making a counteroffer that still yields a good value, but perhaps slightly more in my favor than the original offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is significantly better than my outside offer. Accepting it would give me a value of 549. However, since it is only the first round and given that Player 1 offered relatively little, I can try making a counteroffer that gives me a bigger share of the items. If they accept it, then good, if not, I can accept their offer in the next round given how good it is.\n\nLet's try offering [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nThis means I keep:\n\n*   Item 1: 5 - 1 = 4 units\n*   Item 2: 2 - 0 = 2 units\n*   Item 3: 3 - 0 = 3 units\n*   Item 4: 4 - 0 = 4 units\n*   Item 5: 3 - 0 = 3 units\n\nThe value of this to me is: (4 * 26) + (2 * 55) + (3 * 67) + (4 * 55) + (3 * 5) = 104 + 110 + 201 + 220 + 15 = 650.

Since we are in round 2, the discount factor applies as \\(0.98^{1} = 0.98\\).\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer**: [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] (Items offered to me)\n  - My value from current offer if accepted:\n    - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 81 = 81\n  - Total value = 81\n  - Due to discount factor: Total value with discount = 81 \u00d7 0.98 = 79.38\n\n- **Current Offer vs. My Outside Offer**:\n  - Current Offer Value (with discount): 79.38\n  - My Outside Offer Value: 709\n  - The current offer is significantly less than my outside offer.\n\n- **Potential Counteroffers**:\n  - I need to consider a division where my total adjusted value is maximized and exceeds my outside offer value.\n\nLet's calculate some additional values for potential divisions (which I will retain):\n  \n- **If I keep [4, 2, 2, 3, 3]**:\n  - 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 81 = 324\n  - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 80 = 160\n  - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 20 = 40\n  - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99\n  - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102\n  - Total value = 325 + 160 + 40 + 99 + 102 = 725\n  - Adjusted value with discount = 725 \u00d7 0.98 = 710.5 (exceeds my outside offer)\n\n- **Offer to Player 2**: Corresponding to me keeping [4, 2, 2, 3, 3] would be [1, 0, 1, 1, 0] to Player 2.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nBased on the analysis:\n\n- Accepting the current offer is worse than my outside offer.\n- Walking away gives me 709.\n- Proposing a counteroffer [1, 0, 1, 1, 0] gives me a better adjusted value of 710.5 if accepted, which is preferable.\n\nTherefore, my best action is to propose this counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]}\n```",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 150. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 150. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 624 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 2, 0, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    26 x 0 + 55 x 0 + 67 x 2 + 55 x 0 + 5 x 3\n    which is 149 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 150. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step to determine the best action for Player 2.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n   - My outside offer value: 150\n   - My values of the items: Item 1: 26, Item 2: 55, Item 3: 67, Item 4: 55, Item 5: 5\n   - Total pool of items: 5 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 4 of item 4, 3 of item 5\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.98.  This means that if we reach round 3, any deal will be worth 0.98^(3-1) = 0.98^2 = 0.9604 times its face value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current Offer:** The current offer is [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]. This means I receive 1 unit of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n      - Value of current offer: (1 * 26) + (0 * 55) + (1 * 67) + (1 * 55) + (0 * 5) = 26 + 0 + 67 + 55 + 0 = 148\n      - Since 148 is less than my outside offer of 150, accepting the current offer would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\n\n   - **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 150, while also being potentially acceptable to Player 1. Let's evaluate a few possibilities:\n\n      - **Keeping most of the valuable items:** Let's try keeping all of items 2, 3, and 4, and some of items 1 and 5. How about I offer [4, 0, 0, 0, 2]? This would leave me with:\n         - Item 1: 5 - 4 = 1. Value: 1 * 26 = 26\n         - Item 2: 2 - 0 = 2. Value: 2 * 55 = 110\n         - Item 3: 3 - 0 = 3. Value: 3 * 67 = 201\n         - Item 4: 4 - 0 = 4. Value: 4 * 55 = 220\n         - Item 5: 3 - 2 = 1. Value: 1 * 5 = 5\n         - Total Value: 26 + 110 + 201 + 220 + 5 = 562\n\n      - **Another counteroffer:** Lets try offering [3, 1, 1, 2, 3]. This would leave me with:\n          - Item 1: 5 - 3 = 2. Value: 2 * 26 = 52\n          - Item 2: 2 - 1 = 1. Value: 1 * 55 = 55\n          - Item 3: 3 - 1 = 2. Value: 2 * 67 = 134\n          - Item 4: 4 - 2 = 2. Value: 2 * 55 = 110\n          - Item 5: 3 - 3 = 0. Value: 0 * 5 = 0\n          - Total Value: 52 + 55 + 134 + 110 + 0 = 351\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\n   - Accepting the current offer yields a value of 148, which is less than my outside offer of 150.  So, I should not accept.\n   - Walking away yields a value of 150.\n   - Offering [4, 0, 0, 0, 2] results in a value of 562, which is much greater than my outside offer and the current offer.\n   - Offering [3, 1, 1, 2, 3] results in a value of 351, which is much greater than my outside offer and the current offer.\n\nThe offer [3, 1, 1, 2, 3] leaves me with a decent amount and is more reasonable than offering [4, 0, 0, 0, 2].\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 1, 1, 2, 3]}\n",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To decide my action, I will analyze the situation step by step, as outlined.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n1. **Outside Offer Value:**\n   - My outside offer value is 918.\n\n2. **Values of the Items:**\n   - Value per unit for item 1: 84\n   - Value per unit for item 2: 33\n   - Value per unit for item 3: 52\n   - Value per unit for item 4: 91\n   - Value per unit for item 5: 53\n\n3. **Total Pool of Items:**\n   - 4 units of item 1\n   - 5 units of item 2\n   - 5 units of item 3\n   - 3 units of item 4\n   - 4 units of item 5\n\n4. **Discount Factor:**\n   - As this is round 1, the discount factor does not affect my decision yet because this is the initial offer. It affects rounds 2 and 3, discounting future offers.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\nSince there's no current offer from Player 2, I will consider a possible initial counteroffer and calculate its value.\n\n#### Possible Counteroffer:\n- Based on the total pool and my private values, I should aim to retain as many high-value items as possible while making a reasonable offer to Player 2.\n\nLet's consider offering Player 2:\n- 2 units of item 1 (I keep 2)\n- 3 units of item 2 (I keep 2)\n- 3 units of item 3 (I keep 2)\n- 1 units of item 4 (I keep 2)\n- 2 units of item 5 (I keep 2)\n\n#### Calculate Total Value of Keeping:\n\n- 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 84 = 168\n- 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 33 = 66\n- 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 52 = 104\n- 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 91 = 182\n- 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 53 = 106\n\nTotal value to me = 168 + 66 + 104 + 182 + 106 = 626\n\n#### Compare the Value:\n- The calculated total value of 626 is less than my outside offer of 918.\n\nBased on this, proposing the above division would be mistake #2 since it is less valuable than my outside offer.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nSince the initial proposed division gives me less value than my outside offer, I need to adjust the offer to ensure my retained items have a combined value of at least 918. Let's make a new counteroffer:\n\n- Offer Player 2:\n  - 1 units of item 1 (I keep 3)\n  - 2 units of item 2 (I keep 3)\n  - 2 units of item 3 (I keep 3)\n  - 1 unit of item 4 (I keep 2)\n  - 2 units of item 5 (I keep 2)\n\n#### New Calculation for Total Value Keeping:\n\n- 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 84 = 252\n- 3 units of item 2: 3 \u00d7 33 = 99\n- 3 units of item 3: 3 \u00d7 52 = 156\n- 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 91 = 182\n- 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 53 = 106\n\nTotal value to me = 252 + 99 + 156 + 182 + 106 = 795\n\n#### Decision:\n\nEven this revised offer doesn't meet my outside offer. However, too much of the high-value items cannot be retained because I need to give the other player a sensible portion. Let's try a final significant tweak for a satisfactory offer:\n\nOffer Player 2:\n- 0 units of item 1 (I keep 4)\n- 1 units of item 2 (I keep 4)\n- 1 units of item 3 (I keep 4)\n- 0 unit of item 4 (I keep 3)\n- 2 units of item 5 (I keep 2)\n\n#### Calculation:\n\n- 4 units of item 1: 4 \u00d7 84 = 336\n- 4 units of item 2: 4 \u00d7 33 = 132\n- 4 units of item 3: 4 \u00d7 52 = 208\n- 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 91 = 273\n- 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 53 = 106\n\nTotal value to me = 336 + 132 + 208 + 273 + 106 = 1055\n\nThis offer secures a value above my outside offer. I will propose this configuration:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 1, 0, 2]}\n```\n\nThis ensures I maximize the value of my retained items and avoid all identified mistakes.",

For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 2, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    2 x 0 + 40 x 2 + 88 x 2 + 28 x 2 + 22 x 2\n    which is 356 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 358. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 1, 0, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 1, 0, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 358\n*   Item values: Item 1 = 2, Item 2 = 40, Item 3 = 88, Item 4 = 28, Item 5 = 22\n*   Total items: Item 1 = 4, Item 2 = 5, Item 3 = 5, Item 4 = 3, Item 5 = 4\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.98. This means that accepting an offer in a later round is slightly less valuable than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am offered [0, 1, 1, 0, 2]. This means I would receive 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5. My value would be:\n    (0 * 2) + (1 * 40) + (1 * 88) + (0 * 28) + (2 * 22) = 0 + 40 + 88 + 0 + 44 = 172. This is much less than my outside offer of 358.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 358. Let's consider some options, keeping in mind I need to offer something to Player 1 to avoid Mistake 3. Also, I need to make sure my counteroffer is better than my outside option to avoid Mistake 2.\n\n    Let's try offering Player 1 only the minimum possible units of each item. That would be [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The total value to me would then be (4 * 2) + (5 * 40) + (5 * 88) + (3 * 28) + (4 * 22) = 8 + 200 + 440 + 84 + 88 = 820, which is way better than my outside offer, so now let's try another scenario\n\n    Let's consider a counteroffer where I give Player 1 one unit of item 1, one unit of item 2, one unit of item 3, one unit of item 4, and one unit of item 5: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. Then I would have [3, 4, 4, 2, 3]. My value would be:\n    (3 * 2) + (4 * 40) + (4 * 88) + (2 * 28) + (3 * 22) = 6 + 160 + 352 + 56 + 66 = 640. This is greater than my outside offer of 358.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer of 172 is less than my outside offer of 358, so I shouldn't accept it. Offering [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] is probably a bad move, since it might terminate the negotiations, even though it would provide me a value of 820. I believe I will propose a counteroffer to continue negotiations. I will propose giving [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] to Player 1, which leads to a value of 640 for me.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```",

Thus, accepting the current offer would be a Mistake 4 as it offers less than my guaranteed alternative.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n\n   - Accepting the current offer is not advisable, as it is worth significantly less than my outside offer.\n   - Walking away would ensure I receive my outside offer value of 918, which is better than the current offer.\n   - Make a counteroffer that maximizes my value while considering the discount factor for future rounds.\n\n   Instead of accepting or walking away immediately, let's calculate a counteroffer that gives me more value:\n\n   For example, propose keeping:\n   - 3 units of Item 1 = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252\n   - 4 units of Item 2 = 4 \u00d7 33 = 132\n   - 4 units of Item 3 = 4 \u00d7 52 = 208\n   - 2 units of Item 4 = 2 \u00d7 91 = 182\n   - 3 units of Item 5 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159\n\n   Which sums to 252 + 132 + 208 + 182 + 159 = 933 \n\n   Counteroffer Proposal:\n   - Offer 1 unit of Item 1, 1 unit of Item 2, 1 unit of Item 3, 1 unit of Item 4, and 1 unit of Item 5 to Player 2.\n   - This counteroffer totals [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] for Player 2, which is equivalent to the current round 2 offer, but maintains a balance in value closer to my needs.\n\nGiven the analysis, let's propose my counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}",

                    "prompt": "\n    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\n    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\n    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\n    There are 4 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\n    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\n    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 101.\n    Your private values are 2 for item 1, 40 for item 2, 88 for item 3, 28 for item 4, 22 for item 5.\n    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to your total value of all items, which is 820. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 358. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 358. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 540 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 2, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    2 x 0 + 40 x 2 + 88 x 2 + 28 x 2 + 22 x 2\n    which is 356 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 358. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 1, 0, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?
