Your value would be:\n    49 x 0 + 46 x 4 + 34 x 3 + 76 x 3 + 17 x 7\n    which is 633 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 634. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 4, 3, 3, 7] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    49 x 0 + 46 x 4 + 34 x 3 + 76 x 3 + 17 x 7\n    which is 633 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 634. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 4, 3, 3, 7] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    49 x 0 + 46 x 4 + 34 x 3 + 76 x 3 + 17 x 7\n    which is 633 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 634. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 3, 3, 3, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 3, 6, 0, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 4, 3, 2]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [1, 2, 5, 0, 2]\nRound 3: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 4, 3, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 4, 3, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

This means I should be quite aggressive in my negotiation since I have a very good fallback option.\n\nI need to keep most of the high-value items (especially item 3) to exceed my outside offer.\n\nLet me calculate a potential offer where I keep most high-value items:\n- Give Player 2: 3 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 3 units of item 5\n- I keep: 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5\n\nValue for me: (1\u00d77) + (1\u00d729) + (4\u00d794) + (2\u00d762) + (2\u00d721) = 7 + 29 + 376 + 124 + 42 = 578\n\nThis is significantly less than my outside offer (830), so I need to keep more.\n\nLet me try another division:\n- Give Player 2: 4 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5\n- I keep: 0 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5\n\nValue for me: (0\u00d77) + (2\u00d729) + (5\u00d794) + (3\u00d762) + (0\u00d721) = 0 + 58 + 470 + 186 + 0 = 714\n\nStill less than my outside offer.

Let me make a final attempt:\n- Give Player 2: 4 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5\n- I keep: 0 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 1 units of item 5\n\nValue for me: (0\u00d77) + (2\u00d729) + (5\u00d794) + (3\u00d762) + (1\u00d721) = 0 + 58 + 470 + 186 + 21 = 735\n\nEven this very aggressive offer is still worth less than my outside offer (830). However, with the discount factor, accepting in a later round will decrease value further. Given that my outside offer is extremely close to the maximum possible value, I should start with an aggressive offer and be prepared to walk if necessary.\n\nMy initial offer will be to give Player 2 only the lowest-value items to me, while keeping all the high-value items:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 0, 0, 0, 5]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1197. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 969 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 33. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 489 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Your value would be:\n    6 x 0 + 68 x 0 + 58 x 1 + 14 x 1 + 53 x 3\n    which is 231 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 232. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 762. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 744 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 7, 5, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    6 x 0 + 61 x 0 + 38 x 7 + 99 x 5 + 44 x 0\n    which is 761 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 762. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 5, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 5, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To make a decision, I will go through the step-by-step analysis as outlined in the instructions. \n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 762.\n   - The values of the items for me are: \n     - Item 1: 6 per unit\n     - Item 2: 61 per unit\n     - Item 3: 38 per unit\n     - Item 4: 99 per unit\n     - Item 5: 44 per unit\n   - The total pool of items is: \n     - Item 1: 2 units\n     - Item 2: 3 units\n     - Item 3: 7 units\n     - Item 4: 7 units\n     - Item 5: 1 unit\n   - The discount factor is gamma = 0.98. This means if we accept in later rounds, the value is reduced by this factor raised to the power of r-1.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 7, 5, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    6 x 0 + 61 x 0 + 38 x 7 + 99 x 5 + 44 x 0\n    which is 761 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 762. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 5, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 3, 2, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 2, 5, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 2, 5, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

I would keep 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5.\n     - My value:\n       - 2 \u00d7 6 + 3 \u00d7 61 + 3 \u00d7 38 + 3 \u00d7 99 + 0 \u00d7 44 = 12 + 183 + 114 + 297 + 0 = 606\n     - Adjust for discount: 606 \u00d7 0.98 = 593.88\n\n   Since these values are still below my outside offer, I will choose to WALK away, as any viable counteroffer seems unlikely to reach a value greater than 762 given the constraints.\n\n**Final Decision:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

The current offer (280.44 after discount) is better than my outside offer (260)\n2. This is the final round, so any counteroffer risks Player 2 walking away\n3. The current offer gives me most of the high-value item 4 (which is worth 61 per unit to me)\n\nThe rational choice is to accept the current offer. While I could try a more aggressive counteroffer, the risk of ending up with just my outside offer (260) is too high.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 2, 0, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    69 x 1 + 17 x 2 + 6 x 0 + 32 x 1 + 98 x 0\n    which is 135 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 136. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "To determine the appropriate action, let's evaluate the current situation step-by-step.\n\n**1) Analyze the Current Situation:**\n\n- **Outside Offer Value:**\n  - My outside offer value is 640.\n\n- **Values of the Items Involved:**\n  - Item 1: 90\n  - Item 2: 35\n  - Item 3: 6\n  - Item 4: 22\n  - Item 5: 69\n\n- **Total Pool of Items:**\n  - Item 1: 5 units\n  - Item 2: 1 unit\n  - Item 3: 4 units\n  - Item 4: 3 units\n  - Item 5: 4 units\n\n- **Discount Factor Influence:**\n  - The discount factor, \u03b3, is 0.98. It reduces the value of the outcome slightly if the negotiation goes beyond the initial round. Since it is round 1, \u03b3 has no effect yet.\n\n**2) Assess the Value of Offers:**\n\n- **Current Offer:**\n  - The current offer is [2, 1, 1, 1, 1] for me. Let's calculate my total value if I accept this offer:\n    - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 90 = 180\n    - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 35 = 35\n    - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 6 = 6\n    - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 22 = 22\n    - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 69 = 69\n    - Total value = 180 + 35 + 6 + 22 + 69 = 312\n\n  - My value from accepting the current offer is 312, which is significantly less than my outside offer value of 640.\n\n- **Potential Counteroffers:**\n  - I need to propose a counteroffer that gives me more than 640 in value. One option:\n    - Keep [3, 0, 3, 2, 3] for myself, offer [2, 1, 1, 1, 1] to the other player.\n    - Calculate value for items I'll keep:\n      - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270\n      - 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 35 = 0\n      - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18\n      - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 22 = 44\n      - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207\n      - Total value = 270 + 0 + 18 + 44 + 207 = 539\n\n  - The value of keeping [3, 0, 3, 2, 3] is 539, which is still less than 640. I need to adjust further.\n\n**3) Make a Decision Based on the Analysis:**\n\n1. Accepting the current offer is worse than my outside offer.\n2. Propose a counteroffer that yields a value greater than 640.\n3. Walking away now would be suboptimal if I can secure a better deal.\n\nLet's propose a counteroffer that guarantees more than 640 and aligns with my objectives.\n\n- **New Counteroffer Option:** Keep [4, 0, 2, 2, 3] for myself, offer [1, 1, 2, 1, 1] to Player 1.\n  - Calculate value:\n    - 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 90 = 360\n    - 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 35 = 0\n    - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 6 = 12\n    - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 22 = 44\n    - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207\n    - Total value = 360 + 0 + 12 + 44 + 207 = 623\n\n  - 623 is slightly less, keep iterating.\n\n**Another Counteroffer Iteration:**\n- Keep [4, 1, 3, 2, 3], offer [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n  - My total value:\n    - 4 \u00d7 90 + 1 \u00d7 35 + 3 \u00d7 6 + 2 \u00d7 22 + 3 \u00d7 69\n    - Equals = 360 + 35 + 18 + 44 + 207 = 664 > 640\n\nThis counteroffer exceeds the outside offer value.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 1, 3, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    29 x 2 + 45 x 0 + 2 x 1 + 71 x 3 + 17 x 0\n    which is 273 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 274. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Let's go through the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1) Analyze the Current Situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 274.\n   - My values for each item per unit are:\n     - Item 1: 29\n     - Item 2: 45\n     - Item 3: 2\n     - Item 4: 71\n     - Item 5: 17\n   - The total pool of items is: 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor influences the value by reducing the potential maximum value by 0.98^r for each round (except the 1st round). In later rounds, waiting will result in a diminishing value of a given offer due to the discount factor.\n\n2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n   - For the current offer: [1, 0, 3, 1, 0]\n     - My value for this offer:\n       - 1 unit of item 1: 1 \u00d7 29 = 29\n       - 0 units of item 2: 0 \u00d7 45 = 0\n       - 3 units of item 3: 3 \u00d7 2 = 6\n       - 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 71 = 71\n       - 0 units of item 5: 0 \u00d7 17 = 0\n     - Total value = 29 + 0 + 6 + 71 + 0 = 106\n\n   - The total value of 106 for the current offer is significantly less than my outside offer of 274.\n\n3) Make a Decision Based on the Analysis:\n   - Accepting the current offer would be a mistake (Mistake 4) since it's worse than my outside offer.\n   - Walking away is a fallback option since my outside offer is better than the current offer.\n   - Considering a counteroffer:\n     - I need a counteroffer to ensure the value is above 274 to be considered better than my outside offer.\n     - To achieve this, focus on maximizing items of higher value (e.g., item 4).\n\nLet's calculate two counteroffer examples to see if they are above my outside offer:\n\nExample Counteroffer 1 (What I keep): [1, 1, 2, 2, 1]\n- 1 unit of item 1: 1 \u00d7 29 = 29\n- 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 45 = 45\n- 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 2 = 4\n- 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 71 = 142\n- 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 17 = 17\n- Total value = 29 + 45 + 4 + 142 + 17 = 237 (Not above 274)\n\nExample Counteroffer 2 (What I keep): [2, 1, 1, 2, 1]\n- 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 29 = 58\n- 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 45 = 45\n- 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 2 = 2\n- 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 71 = 142\n- 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 17 = 17\n- Total value = 58 + 45 + 2 + 142 + 17 = 264 (Still not above 274)\n\nFinally, determining what to offer:\nBoth example counteroffers fall below the minimum value needed. I need to propose a distribution where I retain a value above 274. Without calculating every possible combination now, it's prudent for me to choose WALK since any non-calculated counteroffer that yields less than 274 would not be advantageous.\n\nTherefore, my final decision and action will be:\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 134. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 306 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    58 x 0 + 40 x 0 + 4 x 0 + 58 x 0 + 54 x 2\n    which is 108 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 110. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "To decide on my action, I'll follow the step-by-step guide:\n\n### 1) Analyze the Current Situation:\n- **My outside offer value**: 110\n- **Values of items to me**:\n  - Item 1: 58 per unit\n  - Item 2: 40 per unit\n  - Item 3: 4 per unit\n  - Item 4: 58 per unit\n  - Item 5: 54 per unit\n- **Total pool of items**: \n  - 3 units of Item 1\n  - 3 units of Item 2\n  - 4 units of Item 3\n  - 6 units of Item 4\n  - 2 units of Item 5\n- **Discount factor**: If negotiation prolongs, the value decreases due to the discount factor (gamma = 0.98), but currently, it's round 1.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n#### Current Offer:\n- Offer on the table: [3, 3, 1, 2, 2] (the number of each item being offered to me)\n- Value of current offer:\n  - Item 1: 3 \u00d7 58 = 174\n  - Item 2: 3 \u00d7 40 = 120\n  - Item 3: 1 \u00d7 4 = 4\n  - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 58 = 116\n  - Item 5: 2 \u00d7 54 = 108\n- Total value of current offer = 174 + 120 + 4 + 116 + 108 = 522\n\n#### Compare to Outside Offer:\n- The current offer value (522) is much higher than my outside offer (110).\n\n### 3) Make a Decision:\n- **Should I ACCEPT the current offer?**\n  - Yes, because it has significantly higher value (522) compared to my outside offer (110).\n  \n- **Should I WALK away?**\n  - No, because the current offer is much better than my outside offer.\n  \n- **Should I propose a specific COUNTEROFFER?**\n  - No need, as the current offer value is favorable to me.\n\nGiven that accepting this offer provides a higher value than my guaranteed fallback option, the rational decision is to accept the current offer. \n\nTherefore, my action is:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 2, 0, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    64 x 0 + 74 x 2 + 87 x 2 + 40 x 0 + 96 x 4\n    which is 706 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 708. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

So, I should not accept it.\n   \n   - Walking away gives me 979 immediately, which is better than the current offer.\n   \n   - To make a counteroffer, I need to propose a division where my value exceeds my outside offer (979).\n\nLet's try a counteroffer where I aim to propose keeping items with the highest per-unit value for myself:\n\nLet's consider an offer where I keep:\n- [3, 2, 4, 2, 4] \n\nThis would result in:\n- 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 94 = 94\n- 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 65 = 65\n- 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 29 = 58\n- 4 units of item 4 = 4 \u00d7 54 = 216\n- 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135\n\nOffer to the opponent: [1, 1, 2, 4, 3]\nMy total value keeping [3, 2, 4, 2, 4] = 94 + 130 + 116 + 108 + 180 = 628\n\nThis value is still less than my outside offer. Given the constraints, it is challenging to configure an allocation that exceeds my outside offer value without knowing more about Player 1's preferences.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1102. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1131 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Let's try another counteroffer:\n     - Try keeping [4, 3, 1, 4, 1] items and offering [0, 2, 0, 1, 0] to Player 1:\n       - My value:\n         - 4 units of Item 1: 4 \u00d7 33 = 132\n         - 3 units of Item 2: 3 \u00d7 89 = 267\n         - 1 unit of Item 3: 1 \u00d7 96 = 96\n         - 4 units of Item 4: 4 \u00d7 27 = 108\n         - 1 unit of Item 5: 1 \u00d7 45 = 45\n         - Total value = 648 (still less than my outside offer)\n\n   Iterating further, let's adjust items and find a combination that meets or exceeds 711:\n   - Keep [3, 4, 1, 4, 0] for myself, offering [1, 1, 0, 1, 1] to Player 1:\n     - My value:\n       - 3 units of Item 1: 3 \u00d7 33 = 99\n       - 4 units of Item 2: 4 \u00d7 89 = 356\n       - 1 unit of Item 3: 1 \u00d7 96 = 96\n       - 4 units of Item 4: 4 \u00d7 27 = 108\n       - 0 units of Item 5: 0 \u00d7 45 = 0\n       - Total value = 659 (still less than my outside offer)\n\n   Continuing to find a better distribution:\n   - Keep [3, 4, 1, 4, 1] for myself, offering [1, 1, 0, 1, 0] to Player 1:\n     - My value:\n       - 3 units of Item 1: 3 \u00d7 33 = 99\n       - 4 units of Item 2: 4 \u00d7 89 = 356\n       - 1 unit of Item 3: 1 \u00d7 96 = 96\n       - 4 units of Item 4: 4 \u00d7 27 = 108\n       - 1 unit of Item 5: 1 \u00d7 45 = 45\n       - Total value = 704 (less than my outside offer)\n\nAlright, let\u2019s aim to make a counteroffer that tips over:\n   - Keep [3, 3, 1, 4, 1] for myself:\n   - Total value: \n     - Item 1: 3 x 33 = 99\n     - Item 2: 3 x 89 = 267\n     - Item 3: 1 x 96 = 96\n     - Item 4: 4 x 27 = 108\n     - Item 5: 1 x 45 = 45\n     - Total = 615 (less than my outside offer)\n\n  Keeping [3, 4, 1, 4, 1], offering [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]:\n   - My value = 704 (less than outside offer)\n   - Note: The task is challenging with the given distribution.\n   \n   To maximize and strategize, let\u2019s consider a split that maximizes closer:\n   - Keep [4, 4, 1, 5, 1], offer [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]:\n   - Checking:\n     - Item 1: 4 \u00d7 33 = 132\n     - Item 2: 4 x 89 = 356\n     - Item 3: 1 x 96 = 96\n     - Item 4: 4 x 27 = 135\n     - Item 5: 1 x 45 = 45\n     - Total = 765 (greater than outside offer, optimal counter)\n\nHence, the best possible strategy, after numerous checks for slots, is:\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1102. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1131 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 103. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 672 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    12 x 0 + 85 x 1 + 89 x 0 + 17 x 1 + 21 x 0\n    which is 102 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 103. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 0, 2, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 0, 2, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Accepting it would constitute mistake 4.\n\n- **Value of Potential Counteroffers:**\n  - You need to construct a counteroffer that values more than your outside offer, ensuring that you avoid mistake 2: making an offer worse for you than your outside offer.\n\n  Consider keeping more units from higher-valued items (by your valuation).\n\n#### Example Counteroffer Analysis:\nLet's propose a counteroffer where you keep more of Item 2 and 5, as they are highly valued:\n\n1. **Counteroffer: Offer [0, 2, 0, 7, 3] to Player 1 (keeping [3, 5, 2, 1, 2])**\n\n   - Value to you:\n     - 3 units of Item 1 (3 \u00d7 11 = 33)\n     - 5 units of Item 2 (5 \u00d7 98 = 490)\n     - 2 units of Item 3 (2 \u00d7 20 = 40)\n     - 1 unit of Item 4 (1 \u00d7 30 = 30)\n     - 2 units of Item 5 (2 \u00d7 64 = 128)\n\n   - Total value = 33 + 490 + 40 + 30 + 128 = 721\n\nThis counteroffer unfortunately still does not exceed your outside offer value of 790. Let's try again:\n\n2. **Counteroffer: Offer [0, 0, 0, 7, 4] to Player 1 (keeping [3, 7, 2, 1, 1])**\n\n   - Value to you:\n     - 3 units of Item 1 (3 \u00d7 11 = 33)\n     - 7 units of Item 2 (7 \u00d7 98 = 686)\n     - 2 units of Item 3 (2 \u00d7 20 = 40)\n     - 1 unit of Item 4 (1 \u00d7 30 = 30)\n     - 1 unit of Item 5 (1 \u00d7 64 = 64)\n\n   - Total value = 33 + 686 + 40 + 30 + 64 = 853, which is above your outside offer of 790.\n\nThis counteroffer makes sure to maximize value by focusing on high-value items, avoiding mistake 2.\n\n### Step 3: Decision\nGiven the analysis, the strategy should be to make a counteroffer that exceeds your outside offer.\n\n**Action:** \n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 7, 4]}\n```\n\nThis offer ensures your value stays above your outside option, aligning with your objectives and avoiding mistakes.",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 408. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 297 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 408. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 297 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Your value would be:\n    63 x 1 + 70 x 6 + 56 x 1 + 93 x 6 + 77 x 2\n    which is 1251 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1259. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Let's walk through the analysis step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer value is 1259.\n- **Values of the Items**: \n  - Item 1: 63\n  - Item 2: 70\n  - Item 3: 56\n  - Item 4: 93\n  - Item 5: 77\n- **Total Pool of Items**: [1, 6, 3, 6, 2].\n- **Discount Factor Influence**: The discount factor (gamma = 0.98) means that as rounds progress, the effective value of any offer will decrease slightly. It's round 1 right now, so the discount is minimal.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n#### Current Offer on the Table: [0, 2, 2, 1, 1]\n- My share would be [1, 4, 1, 5, 1] after accepting the offer. Calculate the total value:\n  - Item 1: 1 \u00d7 63 = 63\n  - Item 2: 4 \u00d7 70 = 280\n  - Item 3: 1 \u00d7 56 = 56\n  - Item 4: 5 \u00d7 93 = 465\n  - Item 5: 1 \u00d7 77 = 77\n- Total value = 63 + 280 + 56 + 465 + 77 = 941\n\nThis value (941) is less than my outside offer value of 1259.\n\n### Step 3: Decision Making\n\nConsidering the value of the current offer (941) and my outside offer (1259), the current offer is not better than my outside offer. Hence, I should not accept it. \n\nWalking away would guarantee me a value of 1259.\n\nInstead of walking away, I'll consider a counteroffer that could potentially keep my value higher than my outside offer. \n\nI need to ensure the offer provides me more than 1259 in value. Here is a potential counteroffer:\n- I can offer fewer high-value items like item 4 to Player 1, since it has a high value to me.\n\nLet's try offering the following counteroffer:\n- Give Player 1: [0, 2, 1, 1, 0]\n- Keep for myself: [1, 4, 2, 5, 2]\n\nCalculate my value for this counteroffer:\n- Item 1: 1 \u00d7 63 = 63\n- Item 2: 4 \u00d7 70 = 280\n- Item 3: 2 \u00d7 56 = 112\n- Item 4: 5 \u00d7 93 = 465\n- Item 5: 2 \u00d7 77 = 154\n- Total value = 63 + 280 + 112 + 465 + 154 = 1074\n\n1074, however, is still less than my outside offer of 1259.\n\nI'll keep iterating until my offer comes close to or exceeds 1259. Let's bring more value in items with higher importance to me like item 4 and maybe tweak a little more towards achieving my goal.\n\nCounteroffer: Give Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 6, 0]\n- Keep for myself: [1, 6, 3, 0, 2]\n\nCalculate again:\n- Item 1: 1 \u00d7 63 = 63\n- Item 2: 6 \u00d7 70 = 420\n- Item 3: 3 \u00d7 56 = 168\n- Item 4: 0 \u00d7 93 = 0\n- Item 5: 2 \u00d7 77 = 154\n- Total value = 63 + 420 + 168 + 0 + 154 = 805\n\n805 is still less than my outside value of 1259.\n\nLooking deeper, it appears simply walking given my premiums on some high-value items may lead to loss or dissatisfaction if the opponent fails or assumes it's non-negotiable.\n\nGiven all adjustments and rounds kept within adherence to minimizing the mistakes outlined, let's try after weighing we directly walk away.\n\nTherefore:\n\n**{\"action\": \"WALK\"}**\n\nI'm choosing to walk away due to the estimated shortfall in maximizing my placed or evaluated interest against immutable outside offer value.\n",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 2, 3, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    4 x 1 + 63 x 2 + 20 x 3 + 15 x 0 + 98 x 0\n    which is 190 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 191. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 3, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 3, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

My offer should ensure I retain enough value (significantly above my outside offer of 311).\n\nLet me calculate a potential offer where I give Player 2:\n- 4 units of item 1 (keeping 3 for me = 3\u00d741 = 123)\n- 2 units of item 2 (keeping 5 for me = 5\u00d760 = 300)\n- 3 units of item 3 (keeping 1 for me = 1\u00d726 = 26)\n- 1 unit of item 4 (keeping 4 for me = 4\u00d768 = 272)\n- 0 units of item 5 (keeping 1 for me = 1\u00d729 = 29)\n\nTotal value I keep: 123 + 300 + 26 + 272 + 29 = 750, which is well above my outside offer of 311.\n\n## 3) Decision\nThe proposed offer gives me a value of 750, which is significantly better than my outside offer of 311. This is a balanced first offer that leaves room for negotiation while securing good value for me.\n\nTherefore, my first move will be to make the counteroffer described above.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 2, 3, 1, 0]}",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 6, 2, 4, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    83 x 0 + 45 x 6 + 97 x 2 + 24 x 4 + 2 x 0\n    which is 560 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 561. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "To make a decision, let's walk through the steps systematically:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer value is 89.\n- **Values of the Items**:\n  - Item 1: 10 per unit\n  - Item 2: 3 per unit\n  - Item 3: 35 per unit\n  - Item 4: 2 per unit\n  - Item 5: 77 per unit\n- **Total Pool of Items**: \n  - 6 units of item 1\n  - 1 unit of item 2\n  - 1 unit of item 3\n  - 4 units of item 4\n  - 1 unit of item 5\n- **Discount Factor**: If I decide to wait and make a counteroffer, the value in the next round will be discounted by a factor of 0.98. This means delaying to round 2 reduces the effective value obtained from acceptance or counter-offer by multiplying it by 0.98.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer**: [2, 0, 0, 3, 0]\n  - Value of current offer (my portion): \n    - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 10 = 20\n    - 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 3 = 0\n    - 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 35 = 0\n    - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6\n    - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 77 = 0\n  - Total: 26\n\nSince 26 is less than my outside offer of 89, accepting this offer would be a mistake according to Mistake 4.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\n- **Accept the Current Offer?** No, because the total value of the offer is 26, which is less than my outside offer of 89.\n- **Walk Away?** This would guarantee my fallback value of 89.\n- **Propose a Counteroffer?**\n\nTo determine a viable counteroffer, I must ensure the value is equal to or greater than my outside offer of 89. \n\nLet's consider an offer where I keep:\n- 3 units of item 1\n- 1 unit of item 2\n- 1 unit of item 3\n- 1 unit of item 4\n- 0 units of item 5\n\nCalculating the value for myself:\n- 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30\n- 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 3 = 3\n- 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 35 = 35\n- 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 2 = 2\n- 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 77 = 0\n- Total: 70\n\nThis is still below my outside offer of 89, suggesting that keeping more items, especially high-value items, is necessary.\n\nInstead, I'll adjust and try:\n- 4 units of item 1\n- 1 unit of item 2\n- 1 unit of item 3\n- 2 units of item 4\n- 0 units of item 5\n\nCalculating again:\n- 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 10 = 40\n- 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 3 = 3\n- 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 35 = 35\n- 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 2 = 4\n- 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 77 = 0\n- Total = 82\n\nContinuing to iterate:\n- 4 units of item 1\n- 1 unit of item 2\n- 1 unit of item 3\n- 3 units of item 4\n- 0 units of item 5\n\nCalculating again:\n- 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 10 = 40\n- 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 3 = 3\n- 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 35 = 35\n- 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6\n- 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 77 = 0\n- Total = 84\n\nAdjusting once more:\n- 4 units of item 1\n- 1 unit of item 2\n- 1 unit of item 3\n- 3 units of item 4\n- 1 unit of item 5\n\nCalculating again:\n- 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 10 = 40\n- 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 3 = 3\n- 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 35 = 35\n- 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6\n- 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 77 = 77\n- Total = 161\n\nI can finally propose:\n- Offering player 1:\n  - 2 units of item 1\n  - 0 units of item 2\n  - 0 units of item 3\n  - 1 unit of item 4\n  - 0 units of item 5\n\nMy Counteroffer would be [2, 0, 0, 1, 0].\n\nThis ensures I am automatically meeting my outside offer value of 89, and potentially leaving room to adjust based on Player 1's willingness to continue negotiating.\n\n### Final Decision:\nThus, my action will be to propose a counteroffer as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 0, 1, 0]}\n```",

                {
                    "prompt": "\n    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\n    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\n    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\n    There are 6 units of item 1, 1 units of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 1 units of item 5 to divide.\n    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\n    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 101.\n    Your private values are 28 for item 1, 31 for item 2, 50 for item 3, 8 for item 4, 21 for item 5.\n    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to your total value of all items, which is 302. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 99. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 99. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 414 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 0, 3, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "I'll analyze this situation step by step to determine my best action.\n\n## 1) Current Situation Analysis\n\n- My outside offer value: 99\n- My item values: Item 1: 28, Item 2: 31, Item 3: 50, Item 4: 8, Item 5: 21\n- Total pool: 6 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5\n- Discount factor: 0.98 (currently in round 2, so any deal will be worth 0.98 of its original value)\n\n## 2) Value Assessment\n\n**Current offer from Player 2:**\nThey're offering me [2, 0, 0, 1, 0], which means I'd keep:\n- 4 units of item 1: 4 \u00d7 28 = 112\n- 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 31 = 31\n- 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 50 = 50\n- 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 8 = 24\n- 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 21 = 21\n\nTotal value: 238 \u00d7 0.98 (discount) = 233.24\n\nThis is significantly better than my outside offer of 99.\n\n**My previous offer:**\nI offered [2, 0, 0, 3, 0], which would have left me with:\n- 4 units of item 1: 4 \u00d7 28 = 112\n- 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 31 = 31\n- 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 50 = 50\n- 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 8 = 8\n- 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 21 = 21\n\nTotal value: 222 \u00d7 0.98 (discount) = 217.56\n\n**Potential counteroffer analysis:**\nPlayer 2 wants more of item 1 and less of item 4 compared to my initial offer. This suggests they value item 1 more than item 4. Since item 4 is my lowest value item (8), I could consider a counteroffer that gives them more of item 4 and keeps more of the higher-value items for me.\n\nA potential counteroffer could be [2, 0, 0, 2, 0], which would leave me with:\n- 4 units of item 1: 4 \u00d7 28 = 112\n- 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 31 = 31\n- 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 50 = 50\n- 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 8 = 16\n- 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 21 = 21\n\nTotal value: 230 \u00d7 0.98 (discount) = 225.4\n\n## 3) Decision Making\n\nThe current offer from Player 2 is worth 233.24 to me, which is:\n- Much better than my outside offer (99)\n- Better than my previous offer (217.56)\n- Better than the potential counteroffer I calculated (225.4)\n\nSince Player 2 has already made a concession that benefits me (reducing the amount of item 4 I give them from 3 to 1), I should accept this offer. It provides me with significant value well above my outside offer, and there's risk in continuing negotiation to round 3 due to further discounting.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",
