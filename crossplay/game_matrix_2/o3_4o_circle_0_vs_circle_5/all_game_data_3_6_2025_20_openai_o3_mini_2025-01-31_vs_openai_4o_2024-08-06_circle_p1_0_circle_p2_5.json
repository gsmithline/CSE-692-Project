                    "response": "I'll explain my reasoning briefly. My goal is to propose a division that guarantees me at least the value of my outside option (658) while \u201cbuying\u201d Player\u00a02\u2019s agreement by giving them a package that would be (in expectation) about as good as what they would get if they instead \u201cwalked away.\u201d (Recall that if no deal is reached each player gets his outside offer.) Because I value each item differently and \u2013 importantly \u2013 my \u201ccost\u201d for giving an item away is what I lose relative to my full\u2010bundle value, I want to \u201cspend\u201d only as much of my own total value (858) on Player\u00a02 as is needed so that my own share is at least 658. In other words, I may sacrifice at most 858 \u2013 658 = 200 points (by my own values).\n\nLooking at my per\u2011unit values for the five items:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003item\u00a01: 9 \n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003item\u00a02: 81 \n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003item\u00a03: 9 \n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003item\u00a04: 37 \n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003item\u00a05: 37\n\nI want to \u201cpay\u201d Player\u00a02 with items that cost me little. Items\u00a01 and 3 cost me only 9 per unit so these are \u201ccheap\u201d to give away and are likely to be relatively more attractive to Player\u00a02 (since his private values are drawn uniformly between 1 and 101, so his expected value per unit is around 51). In contrast, I very much value item\u00a02 and so I want to keep all 4 units. Items\u00a04 and 5 cost me 37 per unit; so any allocation from these is less attractive (from my perspective) than giving away items\u00a01 and 3. In my available \u201cbudget\u201d of 200 points (my loss compared to my full 858\u2010value bundle) I can \u201cbuy\u201d value to Player\u00a02. Giving away all available units of item\u00a01 (4 units) and item\u00a03 (6 units) costs me 4\u00d79 + 6\u00d79 = 36 + 54 = 90 points. That leaves me with an extra \u201cbudget\u201d of 110, but because 110/37 \u2248 2.97 I can safely add at most 2 whole extra units (from either item\u00a04 or item\u00a05) before my own share would drop below 658. One way to use that extra margin (while keeping my highest\u2010value items for myself) is to add one extra unit from item\u00a04 and one extra unit from item\u00a05. \n\nWith that proposal the division is as follows:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003I give Player\u00a02 all 4 units of item\u00a01 and all 6 units of item\u00a03 (because I value these at only 9 each).\n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003I give him 1 unit of item\u00a04 and 1 unit of item\u00a05.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003I keep all 4 units of item\u00a02, and keep the remaining units of items\u00a04 and\u00a05 (so 4 units of item\u00a04 and 6 units of item\u00a05).\n\nLet\u2019s check my resulting payoff using my private values:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013\u2003item\u00a01: I keep 0 units \u2192 0\u00d79 = 0\n\u2003\u2003\u2013\u2003item\u00a02: I keep 4 units \u2192 4\u00d781 = 324\n\u2003\u2003\u2013\u2003item\u00a03: I keep 0 units \u2192 0\u00d79 = 0\n\u2003\u2003\u2013\u2003item\u00a04: I keep 5 \u2013 1 = 4 units \u2192 4\u00d737 = 148\n\u2003\u2003\u2013\u2003item\u00a05: I keep 7 \u2013 1 = 6 units \u2192 6\u00d737 = 222\nTotal for me = 324 + 148 + 222 = 694 \u2265 658 (so I do strictly better than my outside offer).\n\nOn the other hand, Player\u00a02\u2019s package would be (in terms of unit counts) all of item\u00a01 (4 units), all of item\u00a03 (6 units), plus 1 unit of item\u00a04 and 1 unit of item\u00a05. (I\u2019m not privy to his exact valuations, but since many of the \u201ccheap\u201d items I give him normally have a higher expected value for him \u2013 roughly 51 per unit \u2013 his expected package value comes to about 4\u00d751 + 6\u00d751 + 51 + 51 = 204 + 306 + 51 + 51 = 612. Although that expected value is a bit lower than the average \u201coutside offer\u201d one might expect for him, it is a starting-point offer and he might have drawn lower private numbers; moreover, further rounds allow for adjustment if necessary.)\n\nWith this offer I use my \u201ccheap\u201d items to give Player\u00a02 as much as I can while keeping my own share above my reservation. (In later rounds I could adjust further if needed.) \n\nThus, my proposed initial offer is to give Player\u00a02 the following unit allotment:\n\u2003\u2003item\u00a01: 4,\u2003item\u00a02: 0,\u2003item\u00a03: 6,\u2003item\u00a04: 1,\u2003item\u00a05: 1.\n\nMy response now is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 0, 6, 1, 1]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 394. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 678 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 6, 1, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    98 x 0 + 6 x 1 + 2 x 6 + 35 x 1 + 85 x 4\n    which is 393 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 394. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [4, 0, 6, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [4, 0, 6, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

For example, if I give him 1 unit of item1 (worth 64 to me) and 1 unit of item4 (worth 78 to me), along with all of items 2, 3 and 5, then my kept bundle becomes:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003item1: 6\u20131 = 5 units \u2192 5\u00d764 = 320\n\u2003\u2022\u2003item4: 4\u20131 = 3 units \u2192 3\u00d778 = 234\n\u2003Total for me = 320+234 = 554, which beats my fallback 541.\n\nPlayer 2\u2019s received bundle would be:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003From item1: 1 unit\n\u2003\u2022\u2003From item2: all 3 units\n\u2003\u2022\u2003From item3: all 2 units\n\u2003\u2022\u2003From item4: 1 unit\n\u2003\u2022\u2003From item5: all 2 units\n\nIf Player 2\u2019s private per\u2010unit values average around 51 (the center of 1 to 101), then the \u201cexpected\u201d value of his offered bundle is approximately:\n\u2003item1: 1\u00d751 = 51\n\u2003item2: 3\u00d751 = 153\n\u2003item3: 2\u00d751 = 102\n\u2003item4: 1\u00d751 = 51\n\u2003item5: 2\u00d751 = 102\n\u2003Total \u2248 51+153+102+51+102 = 459\nwhich is above the rough average of 434 he might expect from his outside offer.\n\nThus this offer appears to strike a balance:\n\u2003\u2013 I secure a deal that, if accepted immediately (in round 1 with no discount), gives me 554 (above my fallback of 541).\n\u2003\u2013 Player 2, on average, gets a bundle worth around 459, competitive with his expected fallback.\n\nTherefore, my action in round 1 is to propose the following initial offer, where the numbers represent the number of units I offer to Player 2 for each item type respectively:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 3, 2, 1, 2]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 824. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 687 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [6, 3, 2, 4, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    76 x 6 + 75 x 3 + 37 x 2 + 6 x 4 + 35 x 1\n    which is 814 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 824. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 2, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 3, 2, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Let's evaluate the current situation step by step:\n\n### 1) Analyze the Current Situation:\n- **Outside Offer Value**: 824\n- **Values of the Items**:\n  - Item 1: 76\n  - Item 2: 75\n  - Item 3: 37\n  - Item 4: 6\n  - Item 5: 35\n- **Total Pool of Items**: \n  - Item 1: 6\n  - Item 2: 3\n  - Item 3: 2\n  - Item 4: 4\n  - Item 5: 2\n- **Discount Factor Influence**: With a discount factor of 0.98, the present value of future offers decreases slightly with each round. However, since it's round 1, the discount hasn't significantly impacted potential future values yet.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n\n#### Current Offer:\n- **Current Offer (Items Offered to Me)**: [1, 3, 2, 1, 2]\n  - Total Value if Accepted:\n    - 1 unit of item 1: 1 \u00d7 76 = 76\n    - 3 units of item 2: 3 \u00d7 75 = 225\n    - 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 37 = 74\n    - 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 6 = 6\n    - 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 35 = 70\n  - Total Value = 76 + 225 + 74 + 6 + 70 = 451\n\nComparing the current offer value (451) with my outside offer value (824), the current offer is significantly less valuable.\n\n#### Considerations for Counteroffers:\nWe need to form a counteroffer that yields a value greater than or at least equal to my outside offer (824) to ensure I do not make mistake 2.\n\nOne possible approach to forming a counteroffer is to start by maximizing high-value items based on my private valuations. \n\nFor example, keeping significant portions of item 1 and item 2 could be valuable because they have the highest value per unit.\n\nLet's compute a potential counteroffer:\n\n- Keep all units of item 1, i.e., offer 0 units of item 1 to Player 1 (6 \u00d7 76 = 456)\n- Keep 2 units of item 2, i.e., offer 1 unit of item 2 to Player 1 (2 \u00d7 75 = 150)\n- Offer all units of item 3 and item 5 to Player 1\n- Keep all units of item 4, i.e., offer 0 units of item 4 to Player 1 (4 \u00d7 6 = 24)\n\nThis yields:\n- Item 1: 456\n- Item 2: 150\n- Item 3: 0\n- Item 4: 24\n- Item 5: 0\n\nTotal value = 456 + 150 + 0 + 24 + 0 = 630\n\nThis is still less than 824. Therefore, it's not reasonable to offer anything substantial from items 3 and 5 as they don't contribute significantly to the overall value and I need more from item 2.\n\nLet's propose a new allocation:\n\n- Keep 6 units of item 1\n- Keep 3 units of item 2\n- Offer all units of item 3 and item 5 to the opponent\n- Keep all units of item 4\n\nRecomputing:\n\n- Item 1: 456 (6 units)\n- Item 2: 225 (3 units)\n- Item 3: 0 (0 units)\n- Item 4: 24 (4 units)\n- Item 5: 0 (0 units)\n\nTotal value = 456 + 225 + 0 + 24 + 0 = 705\n\nSince even keeping all of the high-value items doesn't reach 824, a feasible proposal doesn't reach my outside offer value. Therefore, proposing different allocations seems unnecessary unless more valuable units can be removed from the offer to Player 1.\n\n### 3) Decision:\nGiven that any sensible allocation doesn't exceed my outside value, walking away with my outside offer is the wisest decision at this moment, preventing me from making a mistake by proposing or accepting a lower-value offer.\n\n**Action**: {\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

My own private per\u2010unit values are:\n\u2003\u2022 Item1: 89\u2003\u2003(Item total = 2\u00d789 = 178)\n\u2003\u2022 Item2: 52\u2003\u2003(Item total = 1\u00d752 = 52)\n\u2003\u2022 Item3: 28\u2003\u2003(Item total = 6\u00d728 = 168)\n\u2003\u2022 Item4: 69\u2003\u2003(Item total = 7\u00d769 = 483)\n\u2003\u2022 Item5: 64\u2003\u2003(Item total = 4\u00d764 = 256)\nSo my overall value if I got everything would be 1137, and I also hold an outside option of 383.\n\nStep 2: Although I do not know Player 2\u2019s exact values, they are drawn uniformly from 1 to 101. Their average value per unit is around 51. (For instance, the average of 1 and 101 is 51.)\u00a0Hence, if we imagine that Player 2\u2019s \u201cexpected\u201d total value for all items is roughly 1020 (since 2+1+6+7+4 = 20 total units times an average of \u224851), a fair split might be around 510 expected value to them.\n\nStep 3: To craft an offer that is attractive to Player 2 we want to ensure that what they would receive in the items (using their likely per\u2010unit expectation) is at least about what they might get if they \u201cwalk away\u201d (their private outside offer is unknown, but we can assume a value around half their overall total value) and discounted future rounds. At the same time, I wish to keep the items that I value highly for myself. \n\nStep 4: I note my own high-value items: item1 (89 per unit) and item4 (69 per unit) and item5 (64 per unit). The item where my value is relatively low is item3 (28 per unit). Thus, it is sensible to let Player 2 have all of item3 (6 units) so they get an expected extra \u22486\u00d751 = 306 \u201cpoints\u201d from that category even while it costs me little in my own valuation.\n\nStep 5: For item2 (1 unit), although I value it at 52, giving it to Player 2 contributes an expected \u224851 to them\u2014almost the same as their average. So I assign the sole unit of item2 to Player 2.\n\nStep 6: With item1, I prefer to keep both units because of my very high value for them (89 per unit).\n\nStep 7: For item4 (7 total units) I want most but I should award at least one unit so Player 2\u2019s bundle goes a bit higher in expected value. One unit adds about 51 expected value for Player 2; then I keep 6 units (totaling 6\u00d769 = 414 for me).\n\nStep 8: For item5 (4 total units) I decide to offer two units to Player 2. That gives Player 2 an expected additional value of about 2\u00d751 = 102 while I keep 2 units, earning 2\u00d764 = 128.\n\nStep 9: Now, summing up:\n\u2003\u2013 Player 2 would get:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item1: 0 units \u2192 0\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item2: 1 unit \u2192 \u224851\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item3: 6 units \u2192 \u2248306\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item4: 1 unit \u2192 \u224851\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item5: 2 units \u2192 \u2248102\n\u2003Total expected value \u224851 + 306 + 51 + 102 = 510. This is roughly what we expect a fair deal to be from their standpoint.\n\u2003\u2013 I (Player 1) get:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item1: 2 units \u2192 2\u00d789 = 178\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item2: 0 units \u2192 0\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item3: 0 units \u2192 0\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item4: 6 units \u2192 6\u00d769 = 414\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item5: 2 units \u2192 2\u00d764 = 128\n\u2003Total value = 178 + 414 + 128 = 720, which is well above my outside option (383).\n\nStep 10: Because this is the first round (and no discounting occurs yet) and I am the first mover, a proposal with these numbers is a plausible starting point that should appeal to Player 2 while giving me a strong share.\n\nFinal Action:\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 6, 1, 2]}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 6, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    32 x 1 + 37 x 0 + 34 x 6 + 1 x 1 + 18 x 1\n    which is 255 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 256. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 6, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 6, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Step\u2010by\u2010step reasoning:\n1. We want our offer to be acceptable to the opponent while still giving us a deal better than our outside offer (507). If our counteroffer is accepted in round 1, no discount applies.\n2. Our total value, if we got all items, is 691. Our items have different values to us. Our highest\u2010valued items are item 1 (56 per unit), item 4 (41 per unit) and item 3 (35 per unit). Items 2 (8) and 5 (12) are relatively low for us.\n3. Since the offer we make specifies what we give to Player 2, we\u2019d like to allocate most of their \u201cshare\u201d to items that are not very valuable to us (items 2 and 5) while conceding only as much from our higher\u2010value items as necessary. \n4. A rough check: Player 2\u2019s expected per\u2013unit value is around 51 (the average of a uniform [1,101]). Their total value if they got all items would thus be very high, but their outside offer (their disagreement option) is drawn uniformly between 1 and their full total (roughly averaging around 561). To have them accept in round 1, we want to offer them a package that gives them an expected value at least comparable (about 561) to their expected outside offer.\n5. The full stock is: item 1: 5, item 2: 6, item 3: 5, item 4: 4, item 5: 2; total 22 units. To give Player 2 roughly 561 in expected value at 51 per unit they would need approximately 11 units of items from their perspective.\n6. We can achieve this by easily conceding items 2 and 5 (which total 8 units) since they are low\u2010value for us and give Player 2 about 6\u00d751 + 2\u00d751 = 408 expected value. We then need roughly 3 more units from a higher\u2013value item. Of our \u201chigh\u201d items, item 3 (value 35) is less crucial than item 1 (56) or item 4 (41). Hence, we propose giving Player 2 3 units of item 3.\n7. Under this proposed offer the allocation is as follows:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Offer to Player 2: item 1: 0, item 2: 6, item 3: 3, item 4: 0, item 5: 2.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 This leaves us with: item 1: 5, item 2: 0, item 3: 2, item 4: 4, item 5: 0.\n8. Our own value is then:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 5 \u00d7 56 = 280\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 2 \u00d7 35 = 70\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 4 \u00d7 41 = 164\n\u2003\u2003Total = 280 + 70 + 164 = 514, which is just above our outside offer of 507.\n9. Player 2 gets the items we offered:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Their expected value \u2248 6\u00d751 (item 2) + 3\u00d751 (item 3) + 2\u00d751 (item 5) = 306 + 153 + 102 = 561,\n\u2003\u2003which is around what their disagreement option is expected to be.\n10.

My private values per unit are:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 1: 74\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 2: 43\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 3: 47\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 4: 40\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 5: 7\n\u2003Thus if I got every unit I would value the bundle at 1033.\n\n3. My private outside offer is 694. In any agreement I must get more than that (accounting also for the discount, though on round 1 there is no discount penalty).\n\n4. Looking at my relative strengths:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 For item 1 (74) I have a strong benefit compared with an opponent with unknown but roughly average valuations (~51 expected per unit given the uniform 1\u2013101 distribution).\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 3 (47) is also relatively attractive.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 In contrast, for items 2, 4, and especially 5 (7 for me) the opponent is likely to have a more favorable per\u2010unit valuation.\n\u2003This suggests I should \u201cclaim\u201d items 1 and 3 for myself to maximize my value while offering the opponent the items on which I have a disadvantage.\n\n5. If I take all of item 1 and the only unit of item 3 then my \u201cshare\u201d is:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 1: 9 units at 74 \u2192 9\u00d774 = 666\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 3: 1 unit at 47 \u2192 47\n\u2003\u2003Total = 666 + 47 = 713, which is above my outside offer of 694.\n\n6. The remaining items (items 2, 4, and 5) then go to Player 2. Their aggregate \u201coffer\u201d in expected value terms (using an estimated average of about 51 per unit) would be:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 2: 4 units\u2003\u2192 about 4\u00d751 = 204\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 4: 3 units\u2003\u2192 about 3\u00d751 = 153\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 5: 4 units\u2003\u2192 about 4\u00d751 = 204\n\u2003\u2003Total \u2248 204 + 153 + 204 = 561.\n\u2003While this is a rough estimate, it is likely to be around or slightly above many realizations of Player 2\u2019s private outside offer (which, on average, would be roughly half of what their total full\u2010bundle value would be).\n\n7. Such a division uses my strong position on items 1 and 3 while still giving Player 2 an allocation that, by our estimates, should be acceptable relative to their outside option (especially when compared with the risk/cost of continuing negotiations with discounting).\n\n8. Therefore, for my initial action (remember, my action is to propose an offer \u2013 a COUNTEROFFER \u2013 since there is no current offer on the table), I will offer the opponent the full amounts of items 2, 4, and 5, while keeping all of item 1 and the unit of item 3.\n\nThus, my counteroffer is as follows.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 4, 0, 2, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    21 x 0 + 15 x 4 + 26 x 0 + 39 x 2 + 76 x 1\n    which is 214 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 215. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "I\u2019ll explain my thought process before giving you my move.\n\n1. First, I note the totals of each item:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 3 units\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 2 units\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 6 units\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 2 units\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 6 units\n\n2. My private values are:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 10\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 88\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 67\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 57\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 43\n\u2003\u2003which totals 980 when I have everything. My outside offer is 372.\n\n3. Because this is round 1 (no discount yet) and I must give an initial offer (i.e. I specify what I will \u201cgive to\u201d Player 2), I want to design an offer that \u201csplits\u201d the surplus fairly (taking into account that the opponent\u2019s values are unknown but drawn from a uniform distribution from 1 to 101, with an average of about 51 per unit).\n\n4. I think about which items I have \u201cadvantage\u201d on and which the opponent likely values more. For example:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 1: I only value it at 10 whereas on average the opponent might value it around 51. I therefore prefer to let Player 2 have these units.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 2: I value them highly (88 each) while the opponent\u2019s average is only about 51. I want to keep both units.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 3: My value is 67 versus an approximate opponent value of 51. I have an advantage, so I try to keep most of these units. However, since the advantage isn\u2019t huge, I concede a couple of units.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 4: My value is 57 versus an estimated 51 for my opponent, a small advantage; I prefer to keep these.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 5: I value these at 43 while the opponent\u2019s average value is higher (around 51), so I favor giving almost (or all) of these to the other side.\n\n5. With this idea I propose the following allocation (remember, the \u201coffer\u201d is what I give to Player 2):\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 For Item 1, I offer all 3 units.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 For Item 2, I offer 0 units (keeping both for myself).\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 For Item 3, I offer 2 units (keeping 4 for myself).\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 For Item 4, I offer 0 units (keeping both for myself).\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 For Item 5, I offer all 6 units.\n\u2003\u2003That way, my allocation becomes:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003- Item 1: 0 units (0\u00d710 = 0)\n\u2003\u2003\u2003- Item 2: 2 units (2\u00d788 = 176)\n\u2003\u2003\u2003- Item 3: 4 units (4\u00d767 = 268)\n\u2003\u2003\u2003- Item 4: 2 units (2\u00d757 = 114)\n\u2003\u2003\u2003- Item 5: 0 units (0\u00d743 = 0)\n\u2003\u2003Total value for me = 176 + 268 + 114 = 558, which is well above my outside offer of 372.\n\u2003\u2003Meanwhile, the opponent gets:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003- Item 1: 3 units \n\u2003\u2003\u2003- Item 3: 2 units\n\u2003\u2003\u2003- Item 5: 6 units.\n\u2003\u2003Estimating using an average value of around 51 per unit, their expected value is roughly 3\u00d751 + 2\u00d751 + 6\u00d751 = 561. This is comparable to my share and should be tempting given they are also likely comparing with their outside offer.\n\n6. This division carefully \u201csplits\u201d the surplus by conceding more on the items that the opponent is likely to prize and holding on to items where I hold a personal advantage.\n\nBased on this analysis, I now provide my initial offer in the proper format:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 0, 2, 0, 6]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    11 x 0 + 33 x 0 + 1 x 0 + 37 x 0 + 10 x 3\n    which is 30 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 31. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 0, 2, 0, 6]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 0, 2, 0, 6]\n\n    What is your action?

My privately\u2010known per\u2010unit values are very high on items 1 (85) and 2 (79), moderate on item 3 (30) and item 5 (25), and low on item 4 (10). In order to maximize my own total gain I would like to keep almost everything from the high\u2010value items (items 1 and 2) while \u201cbuying\u201d agreement by offering Player\u00a02 primarily items that I value less (especially item 4, and then some of item 5 and as needed item 3).\n\nBoth players have an outside option; mine is 205 and Player\u00a02\u2019s (unknown) is drawn uniformly so its expected value is roughly half of their maximum possible total (with an \u201caverage\u201d around 51 per unit, roughly a split of the overall value). In total there are 19 units. Giving roughly half the \u201cunits\u201d (about 9\u201310 units) to Player\u00a02 should be enough to beat their outside option (especially since we are in round 1 with no discounting yet). \n\nTo keep my high\u2010value items, I choose to keep all of items 1 (3 units) and 2 (5 units). That already amounts to 8 units of high\u2010value items that I would not want to \u201csell.\u201d For the remaining items the totals are:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 3: 4 units available\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 4: 5 units available\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 5: 2 units available\nGiving Player\u00a02 a total of roughly 10 units should be enough, but I want to \u201cpay\u201d with items that hurt me least. Item 4 is my least\u2013valuable (10 per unit) so I give away all 5 units of item 4. That gives Player\u00a02 5 units already. Then I add all 2 units of item 5 (my value 25 per unit) so now Player\u00a02 has 7 units. I need 3 more units to reach about 10 total units; from the remaining item 3 (moderate value) I offer 3 of the 4 available units to Player\u00a02 and keep 1 unit for myself.\n\nThus, my full offer to Player\u00a02 is to receive:\n\u2003Item 1: 0 units (I keep all 3)\n\u2003Item 2: 0 units (I keep all 5)\n\u2003Item 3: 3 units (I keep 1)\n\u2003Item 4: 5 units (I give all)\n\u2003Item 5: 2 units (I give all)\n\nThis gives Player\u00a02 a \u201cpackage\u201d with 10 units total. Even if Player\u00a02\u2019s unknown values average near 51 per unit, their expected total value from the offer would be around 10\u00d751 \u2248 510, which is above what they might expect from their outside offer. At the same time, I preserve nearly all of the very high\u2013valued items. \n\nAccordingly, my action in round 1 is to make a counteroffer with the offer vector [0, 0, 3, 5, 2].\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 3, 5, 2]}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 52. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 567 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    34 x 0 + 21 x 2 + 77 x 0 + 18 x 0 + 39 x 0\n    which is 42 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 52. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 3, 5, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 3, 5, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "I want to design my first offer so that I \u201cbuy\u201d some extra value for myself on the items I care most about, while \u201cselling\u201d (i.e. conceding) items that I value less but that may be attractive to Player 2. (Remember: I get a discounted deal value if we agree sooner; if we fail to agree I get my outside offer of 586.) My own per\u2010unit values are high on item 1 (62), item 3 (72), and especially item 5 (77). In contrast, I care much less about item 2 (21) and item 4 (6). Although Player 2\u2019s exact per\u2010unit values are unknown (they\u2019re drawn uniformly over 1 to 101) it is reasonable to expect that on average Player 2 will value each unit near 51. That means\u2013in expectation\u2013that Player 2\u2019s total value for all items would be roughly\n\n\u2003\u2003item1: 5\u00d751 = 255  \n\u2003\u2003item2: 3\u00d751 = 153  \n\u2003\u2003item3: 4\u00d751 = 204  \n\u2003\u2003item4: 7\u00d751 = 357  \n\u2003\u2003item5: 3\u00d751 = 153  \n\u2003\u2003Total \u2248 1122\n\nand so their random outside offer will average around \u00bd\u00d71122\u2248561. (My outside offer is fixed at 586.) \n\nSince I must get at least as much as my outside offer (when discounted) to prefer a deal, I want to secure an allocation where my own items add up (using my private values) to well above 586. My total full\u2010value is 934, so splitting the goods equally (or \u201chalf\u2010half\u201d) might leave me with less than 586 (or barely equal) because I want to exploit that I highly value items 1, 3, and 5. \n\nOne natural idea is to \u201csell\u201d the items I care little about (items 2 and 4) entirely to Player 2 so that (if Player 2\u2019s private values are average) they get about 153+357=510 value on average from those items. But that might be a little under what Player 2 expects from their own outside offer (\u2248561, though that\u2019s just an expectation). To help tilt the balance in favor of immediate acceptance\u2014and considering that item 1 is moderately high for me (62 vs an expected 51 for Player 2)\u2013I can also give up one unit of item 1. In other words, I would propose that Player 2 receives:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 1 unit of item 1  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 all 3 units of item 2  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 none of item 3  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 all 7 units of item 4  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 none of item 5\n\nThen I would keep the remainder:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 1: 5 \u2013 1 = 4 units  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 2: 0 units  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 3: 4 units  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 4: 0 units  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 5: 3 units\n\nMy own deal value would then be:\n\u2003\u20034\u00d762 = 248 (item 1)  \n\u2003\u20034\u00d772 = 288 (item 3)  \n\u2003\u20033\u00d777 = 231 (item 5)  \n\u2003\u2003Total = 248 + 288 + 231 = 767  \nwhich is comfortably above my outside offer of 586.\n\nFor Player 2 (if their values are near 51 per unit on average), the deal gives an expected value of about:\n\u2003\u20031\u00d751 (item 1) + 3\u00d751 (item 2) + 7\u00d751 (item 4)  \n\u2003\u2003= 51 + 153 + 357 = 561  \nwhich is about what they might expect from their outside offer. (If Player 2 happens to have higher values on the items I concede, they\u2019ll do even better.)\n\nThus, this division gives me a strong position while leaving a just\u2010acceptable deal on the table for Player 2 in round 1. \n\nMy move is therefore to offer Player 2 exactly these quantities.

                    "response": "I\u2019ll explain my thinking briefly. I want to design an initial offer that, if accepted, gives me a value better than my \u201cwalk\u2010away\u201d (outside) offer of 409. I can control the proposal by choosing what I give to Player 2; whatever is not offered goes to me. My own per\u2010unit values are:\n\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 24\u2003 (5 units total)\n\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 32\u2003 (2 units total)\n\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 47\u2003 (2 units total)\n\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 97\u2003 (4 units total)\n\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 12\u2003 (3 units total)\n\nSince the total full value for me is 702, my fallback is 409. So in any deal I try to secure more than 409. Given that item 4 is extremely valuable (4\u00d797 = 388) I want to keep all 4 units of item 4 for myself. That gives me nearly what I need. I need a bit more (at least 21 more) to beat 409, and while several items might provide that extra value, I want to \u201cshave\u201d as little as possible from Player 2\u2019s share\u2014so that his own (unknown) private value (and potential outside offer) makes acceptance likely.\n\nOne simple idea is to take one small unit from an item that I value modestly. Item\u00a01 is worth 24 per unit to me. If I take 1 unit of item 1 (keeping it for myself) and offer the rest, then my allocation becomes:\n\u2003\u2022 From item\u00a01: I get 5\u20134 = 1 unit\u2003\u2192 1\u00d724 = 24\n\u2003\u2022 From item\u00a04: I keep all 4 units\u2003\u2192 4\u00d797 = 388\nTotal for me is 24 + 388 = 412, which beats my outside offer of 409.\n\nUnder that proposal, Player\u00a02\u2019s bundle is the remainder:\n\u2003\u2022 Item\u00a01: 4 units\n\u2003\u2022 Item\u00a02: 2 units (all)\n\u2003\u2022 Item\u00a03: 2 units (all)\n\u2003\u2022 Item\u00a04: 0 units (I take all 4)\n\u2003\u2022 Item\u00a05: 3 units (all)\nIf his values are roughly in the same range as ours (with averages around 51 per unit for a uniform [1,101] draw) his allocated bundle would be appealing\u2014giving him an expected share well above what his fallback might be.\n\nThus, my initial counteroffer is to \u201cgive\u201d Player\u00a02 the following quantities: item 1: 4, item 2: 2, item 3: 2, item 4: 0, and item 5: 3. This offer is valid (the numbers sum to the total quantities of each item) and it leaves me with an allocation for which my total value (412) exceeds my outside offer of 409.\n\nTherefore, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 2, 2, 0, 3]}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 1, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    86 x 0 + 7 x 1 + 95 x 1 + 35 x 0 + 91 x 1\n    which is 193 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 194. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [4, 2, 2, 0, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [4, 2, 2, 0, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

In order to improve the chance that Player\u00a02 accepts the offer, I want to leave these items on the table for them because (even though I value them only modestly) Player\u00a02 might value some of these items relatively more.\n3. So a natural proposal is to assign all the \u201clow\u2010value\u201d items to Player\u00a02 \u2013 that is, all 6 of item 2, the only unit of item 4, and all 4 of item 5 \u2013 while I keep all of item 1 and item 3.\n4.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 924. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 918 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 2, 5, 0, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    89 x 3 + 47 x 2 + 94 x 5 + 53 x 0 + 23 x 4\n    which is 923 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 924. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 6, 0, 1, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 6, 0, 1, 4]\n\n    What is your action?

Let\u2019s calculate for keeping [3, 0, 5, 0, 0]:\n     - Value = (3 * 89) + (0 * 47) + (5 * 94) + (0 * 53) + (0 * 23)\n     - Value = 267 + 0 + 470 + 0 + 0\n     - Total = 737, which is still under my outside offer.\n   - Another potential division could be keeping [2, 0, 5, 1, 0]:\n     - Value = (2 * 89) + (0 * 47) + (5 * 94) + (1 * 53) + (0 * 23)\n     - Value = 178 + 0 + 470 + 53 + 0\n     - Total = 701, unsuccessful.\n\n   Continuing this approach to find a viable offer, resulting in:\n   - Keeping [3, 3, 5, 0, 0]:\n     - Value = (3 * 89) + (3 * 47) + (5 * 94) + (0 * 53) + (0 * 23)\n     - Total = 1068.\n   - This surpasses my outside offer, ensuring it's not only valid but also beneficial.\n\n3) **Make a Decision:**\n   - Based on calculations, the current offer of 427 is way below my outside offer of 924.\n   - My calculated counteroffer, [0, 3, 0, 1, 4], provides me with a higher value than my outside offer.\n   - I should COUNTEROFFER offering Player 1 [3, 3, 5, 0, 4]:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 3, 5, 0, 4]}\n```",

Your value would be:\n    64 x 4 + 1 x 1 + 30 x 2 + 91 x 4 + 36 x 4\n    which is 825 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 840. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 4, 4, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 4, 4, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the current situation step by step:\n\n### 1) Analyze the Current Situation:\n\n- **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 840.\n- **Values of the Items Involved:**\n  - Item 1: 64 per unit\n  - Item 2: 1 per unit\n  - Item 3: 30 per unit\n  - Item 4: 91 per unit\n  - Item 5: 36 per unit\n- **Total Pool of Items:**\n  - 4 units of item 1\n  - 1 unit of item 2\n  - 4 units of item 3\n  - 4 units of item 4\n  - 4 units of item 5\n- **Discount Factor Influence:** With a discount factor of 0.98, the value of accepting an offer decreases slightly in future rounds. Given we\u2019re in round 1, this is less of a concern right now but becomes more significant in subsequent rounds.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n\n- **Current Offer Value to Me ([0, 1, 4, 4, 0]):**\n  - Value of item 1: 0 \u00d7 64 = 0\n  - Value of item 2: 1 \u00d7 1 = 1\n  - Value of item 3: 4 \u00d7 30 = 120\n  - Value of item 4: 4 \u00d7 91 = 364\n  - Value of item 5: 0 \u00d7 36 = 0\n  - **Total value = 0 + 1 + 120 + 364 + 0 = 485**\n\n  The current offer gives me a value of 485, which is significantly less than my outside offer of 840.\n\n- **Potential Counteroffers:**\n  Let's consider an offer that maximizes my value while ensuring it's better than my outside offer.\n\n  - If I keep [4, 0, 4, 0, 4], my value would be:\n    - 4 \u00d7 64 = 256 (Item 1)\n    - 0 \u00d7 1 = 0 (Item 2)\n    - 4 \u00d7 30 = 120 (Item 3)\n    - 0 \u00d7 91 = 0 (Item 4)\n    - 4 \u00d7 36 = 144 (Item 5)\n    - **Total value = 256 + 0 + 120 + 0 + 144 = 520**\n\n  This counteroffer still doesn't exceed my outside offer, so I need to adjust further.\n\n  - If I keep [3, 0, 3, 3, 3], my value would be:\n    - 3 \u00d7 64 = 192 (Item 1)\n    - 0 \u00d7 1 = 0 (Item 2)\n    - 3 \u00d7 30 = 90 (Item 3)\n    - 3 \u00d7 91 = 273 (Item 4)\n    - 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (Item 5)\n    - **Total value = 192 + 0 + 90 + 273 + 108 = 663**\n\n  This is still low compared to my outside offer. Let's attempt getting most units for high value items:\n\n  - If I keep [4, 0, 3, 4, 3], my value would be:\n    - 4 \u00d7 64 = 256 (Item 1)\n    - 0 \u00d7 1 = 0 (Item 2)\n    - 3 \u00d7 30 = 90 (Item 3)\n    - 4 \u00d7 91 = 364 (Item 4)\n    - 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (Item 5)\n    - **Total value = 256 + 0 + 90 + 364 + 108 = 818**\n\n  Near but still not quite sufficient.\n\n  - If I propose [3, 0, 3, 4, 4] to Player 1 (keeping [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]), my value is:\n    - 1 \u00d7 64 = 64 (Item 1)\n    - 1 \u00d7 1 = 1 (Item 2)\n    - 1 \u00d7 30 = 30 (Item 3)\n    - 0 \u00d7 91 = 0 (Item 4)\n    - 0 \u00d7 36 = 0 (Item 5)\n    - **Total value = 64 + 1 + 30 + 0 + 0 = 95** \n  - If I propose [4, 1, 4, 4, 4] to Player 1, my value:\n    - 0 \u00d7 64 = 0 (Item 1)\n    - 0 \u00d7 1 = 0 (Item 2)\n    - 0 \u00d7 30 = 30 (Item 3)\n    - 0 \u00d7 91 = 0 (Item 4)\n    - 0 \u00d7 36 = 0 (Item 5)\n    - **Total value = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0**\n\n### 3) Make a Decision Based on the Analysis:\n\n- The current offer value (485) is much lower than my outside offer (840). Accepting it would not be wise.\n- None of the counteroffers considered above reach or exceed the acceptable threshold of 840.\n- Hence, the most strategic decision is to **WALK** and take my guaranteed outside offer, which provides a value of 840.\n\nTherefore, my action will be:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

                    "response": "Step\u2010by\u2010step reasoning:\n1. We know the available items and our private value per unit:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 8 units (value 46 each)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 4 units (value 55 each)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 3 units (value 13 each)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 3 units (value 97 each)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 2 units (value 17 each)\n\u2003\u2003Our total value if we were to get everything is 952, and our outside offer is 224.\n2. Our goal as the proposer is to secure an outcome worth well above 224 while giving Player 2 enough incentive to avoid walking away.\n3. Although Player 2\u2019s exact item values are unknown (drawn uniformly from 1 to 101), we can infer their expected value (roughly 51 per unit) for each item. Comparing these to our own values gives clues as to who \u201cprefers\u201d which items:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 For Item 4: We get 97 per unit vs. an expected ~51 for Player 2. We strongly prefer keeping all of item 4.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 For Items 3 and 5: Our values (13 and 17) are low compared to an expected 51. We can afford to offer all of these items to Player 2.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 For Item 1 (46 for us vs. ~51 for them): They may value these slightly more so a moderate share can be allocated to them.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 For Item 2 (55 for us vs. ~51 for them): We have a slight edge so we may keep most of these.\n4. With these assessments, one reasonable initial offer is to give Player 2:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 3 out of 8 of Item 1 (keeping 5 for ourselves),\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 1 out of 4 of Item 2 (keeping 3 for ourselves),\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 All 3 units of Item 3,\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 None of Item 4 (keeping all 3),\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 All 2 units of Item 5.\n5. Calculating our utility:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 5 \u00d7 46 = 230\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 3 \u00d7 55 = 165\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 3 \u00d7 97 = 291\n\u2003\u2003Sum = 230 + 165 + 291 = 686, which is well above our outside offer value.\n6. Player 2\u2019s expected utility (using the average value of approximately 51 per unit) would be roughly:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 3 \u00d7 51 = 153\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 1 \u00d7 51 = 51\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 3 \u00d7 51 = 153\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 2 \u00d7 51 = 102\n\u2003\u2003Sum \u2248 459\n7. This division makes an offer that is generous enough (especially with the items they likely value more, such as Item 3 and Item 5) while allowing us to keep the items we value most.\n8. Since this is a valid offer (each number is within the available units), I will propose it.\n\nFinal action below:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 1, 3, 0, 2]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 974. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1020 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 0, 3, 3, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    90 x 5 + 63 x 0 + 100 x 3 + 68 x 3 + 19 x 1\n    which is 973 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 974. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Further propose a different composition to cross my mark of 974.\n\nUltimately, I haven\u2019t found an acceptable counteroffer surpassing the value of 974 that meets our constraints considering interactive decision-making requiring negotiation offers that support feasible agreement to Player 1 too.

However, my guaranteed outside option is 998, which is almost as good. To do any deal, I would have to \u201cpay\u201d from my pie by giving some items to Player 2. Because my deal must have my share\u2019s value at least 998 (or I\u2019d be better off walking), I can only afford to sacrifice at most 1077 \u2013 998 = 79 points (as measured by my own private values). In practical terms, that means any counteroffer I make must allocate items to Player 2 whose total cost (using my private unit values) is no more than 79.\n\nBecause my items\u2019 values (for me) come in chunks (for example, one unit of item 1 costs 21; one unit of item 2 costs 77; and so on), even the \u201cbest\u2010ratio\u201d item for me is item 1 (21 per unit) so that even if I offered 3 units of item 1 (cost 63), Player 2 would be getting, in expectation, about 3\u00d751 = 153 value (since their private values are drawn uniformly from 1 to 101, the midpoint of which is about 51). Such an amount is very low compared to the typical outside offer that Player 2 might get (on average roughly half of their potential total value, which computes to nearly 485). In other words, any division that gives me at least 998 leaves so little \u201cextra\u201d value for Player 2 that it is very unlikely they would accept it. \n\nGiven that if I attempt a deal I must essentially offer almost nothing to Player 2 \u2013 a deal that, by any rational analysis on their side, is far worse than what they might get by walking away \u2013 I am very unlikely to reach agreement. Since prolonging negotiations (or having Player 2 counter) would also introduce discounting effects, my safe and best-known option is to guarantee my outside offer of 998.\n\nThus, considering the risk that any deal would leave me with only a tiny surplus compared to my outside offer, my best decision is not to enter into further negotiations.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

                    "response": "I will explain my thinking in detail. I know that if no agreement is reached each player \u201cwalks\u2010away\u201d and gets their \u201coutside offer.\u201d My private outside offer guarantees me 867 units of value. (My maximum \u201cpie\u201d from a full\u2010allocation of the items is 969 in my own numbers.) Thus any deal I propose must give me at least 867; in other words I must \u201ckeep\u201d at least 867 in my own valuation. (I also note that because the negotiation is \u201cdiscounted\u201d round\u2010by\u2010round\u2014with \u03b3 = 0.98\u2014a delay will reduce the value, so a good deal now is important.) \n\nI also note that every item has two \u201cvalues\u201d: my own private value per unit and (unknown to me) Player\u00a02\u2019s private value (drawn uniformly from 1 to 101). My numbers per unit are:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a01:\u200395\u2003(units available: 2)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a02:\u2003100\u2003(units available: 1)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a03:\u20039\u2003(units available: 7)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a04:\u200397\u2003(units available: 4)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a05:\u200376\u2003(units available: 3)\nSo if I got all items I\u2019d get 2\u00d795 + 1\u00d7100 + 7\u00d79 + 4\u00d797 + 3\u00d776 = 969.\n\nBecause I want to \u201cclaim\u201d almost all the value while still making the deal acceptable for Player\u00a02, I need to \u201cpay\u201d as little (in terms of my own value) as possible while giving them something they are likely to prefer to what they could get outside. In this bargaining problem their outside offer (and thus their reservation utility) is generated by their own private numbers; we know that on average their total \u201cfull\u2010allocation\u201d value is 867 and so (since their offer is drawn uniformly from 1 to 867) on average their outside offer would be about 867/2 \u2248434. (Of course, Player\u00a02 knows their own exact numbers\u2014but I do not.) \n\nI want to give them items that are \u201ccheap\u201d for me but (on expectation) \u201cmore attractive\u201d for them. In my bundle the \u201ccheapest\u201d item is item\u00a03 (my value 9 per unit) even though for Player\u00a02 the per\u2013unit value (unknown to me) will on average be around (1+101)/2 = 51. In effect, every unit of item\u00a03 \u201ccosts\u201d me only 9 while \u201cworth\u201d about 51 to them. \n\nI must \u201cpay\u201d them enough so that the deal is at least as good as their outside option. At the same time, because I am the proposer\u2014and my \u201cthreat point\u201d (867) is quite high\u2014I want to claim as much of the high\u2013value items as possible. Unfortunately, if I try to \u201cbuy\u201d more surplus by giving away even one unit of an item I value highly (say item\u00a01, 2, 4, or 5) I lose much more for myself. In fact, if I tried to give away any unit other than item\u00a03, I would \u201cpay\u201d somewhere between 76 and 100 in my value, which is not minimal. (A simple check shows that if I want to keep at least 867 out of 969, I can sacrifice at most 969 \u2013 867 = 102 points from my \u201cpie.\u201d Using my low\u2013value item, item\u00a03, at 9 per unit, the maximum I can \u201cpay\u201d is with 7 units \u2013 that would cost me 63, leaving me with 969 \u2013 63 = 906, which is comfortably above 867.) \n\nThus, my plan is to \u201cgive\u201d Player\u00a02 all 7 units of item\u00a03 and keep everything else. This offer gives me a value of 906 (calculated as: 2\u00d795 + 100 + 4\u00d797 + 3\u00d776 = 906) while leaving Player\u00a02 the 7 units of item\u00a03. (For Player\u00a02 the value of these 7 units may vary, but on average 7\u00d751 = 357\u2014and if their private value for item\u00a03 is on the higher side, the bundle could be attractive relative to their outside option.) \n\nI recognize that if Player\u00a02 happens to be \u201clucky\u201d in the draw for item\u00a03\u2019s value then they might feel the bundle is good enough to accept; if not, they can always counteroffer on a later round (keeping in mind discounting). In any event, this is my first move in round\u00a01.\n\nTherefore, my round 1 action is to propose the division where I give Player\u00a02 exactly the 7 units of item\u00a03 and keep all the others.\n\nMy action in the required format is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 7, 0, 0]}",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value.

                    "response": "To evaluate the current situation and make a decision, let's walk through the step-by-step questions:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - **My outside offer value:** 788\n   - **Values of the items involved:**\n     - Item 1: 60\n     - Item 2: 29\n     - Item 3: 32\n     - Item 4: 87\n     - Item 5: 93\n   - **Total pool of items:** \n     - 2 units of item 1\n     - 1 unit of item 2\n     - 7 units of item 3\n     - 4 units of item 4\n     - 3 units of item 5\n   - **Discount factor influence:** The discount factor (gamma = 0.98) decreases the present value of the negotiation outcome if we delay. Therefore, it is better to achieve an agreement sooner if possible.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer (Player 1's offer of [0, 0, 7, 0, 0]):** \n     - My value = 0 \u00d7 60 (item 1) + 0 \u00d7 29 (item 2) + 7 \u00d7 32 (item 3) + 0 \u00d7 87 (item 4) + 0 \u00d7 93 (item 5)\n     - Total value to me = 224\n   - **Comparing to my outside offer:** \n     - 224 (value from accepting current offer) is significantly less than 788 (my outside offer). Therefore, accepting this offer would result in Mistake 4 (accepting an offer worse than my outside offer).\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - **Should I accept the current offer?** No, because it's much lower than my outside offer.\n   - **Should I walk away?** Not immediately, unless I can't formulate a better counteroffer that Player 1 might accept.\n   - **Should I propose a specific counteroffer?** Yes, create a counteroffer that is valued higher than my outside offer of 788.\n\nTo find an optimal counteroffer:\n- Let's calculate some potential counteroffers:\n  - If I keep all units of highest value items first:\n    - [0, 0, 2, 4, 3]: 0 \u00d7 60 + 0 \u00d7 29 + 2 \u00d7 32 + 4 \u00d7 87 + 3 \u00d7 93 = 905\n  - A more distributed offer that is also better than the outside offer:\n    - [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]: 60 + 29 = 89, which is too low.\n    - [2, 0, 0, 0, 0]: 2 \u00d7 60 = 120, which is too low.\n    - [0, 1, 2, 1, 0]: 0 + 29 + 2 \u00d7 32 + 87 = 180, which is too low.\n\nFrom these attempts, the division where I keep [2 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5] seems to be suitable. I'll give away items with high value to player 1 only if they help in reaching above 788.\n\n- **Conclusion:** I'll propose a COUNTEROFFER that results in a total value higher than my outside offer while still leaving room for Player 1 to accept it. Keeping more valuable items optimizes my result.\n \nMy optimal counteroffer entails a split where I propose:\nOffer: [2, 1, 0, 4, 0]\nThis offer gives away lower item 4, being of marginally higher value across a smaller unit count, by ultimately keeping precious assets for myself.\n\nFinally, my action and offer response would be:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 0, 4, 0]}\n```\n\nThis counteroffer provides me with a value of:\n- 0 \u00d7 60 (item 1)\n- 1 \u00d7 29 (item 2)\n- 0 \u00d7 32 (item 3)\n- 4 \u00d7 87 (item 4)\n- 0 \u00d7 93 (item 5)\n- Total value to me = 348; not ideal yet considered bettering, readability being added up to 788 or negated unsatisfactorily.",

In response, in Round 1 Player\u202f2\u2019s offer (which is currently on the table for me) was to give me [2, 1, 0, 4, 0]\u2014so I would receive items 1,2, and 4 in full while Player\u202f2 would \u201ckeep\u201d the remaining items: item\u202f3 (all 7 units) plus item\u202f5 (all 3 units).\n\n2. Using my private values:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 My value for if I accept the current offer is:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 2\u00d795 = 190\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 1\u00d7100 = 100\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 0\u00d79 = 0\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 4\u00d797 = 388\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 0\u00d776 = 0\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003Total = 678.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 With the discount factor for round 2 (gamma = 0.98 raised to the power (2\u20131)=1), the present\u2010value is 678\u00d70.98 \u2248 664.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 My private outside option is 867. So accepting the current offer would give me about 664, well below my outside option.\n\n3. As the game is in Round 2, I have the opportunity to make a counteroffer. I might consider proposing a deal that awards me nearly all of the \u201chigh\u2010value\u201d items (items 1, 2, 4 and 5) because my private unit values are very high on these (95, 100, 97, and 76, respectively) and give up only \u201clow\u2010value\u201d item 3 (worth 9 per unit) to make the deal attractive to Player\u202f2.\n\n4. In an ideal counteroffer from my perspective I would like to keep all of items 1, 2, 4, and 5 (yielding me a base of 190+100+388+228 = 906) and \u201cgive\u201d Player\u202f2 all of item 3 (7 units) so that my total value is 906\u2014discounted to about 888\u2014which is above my outside offer value. However, notice that in the offer already on the table, Player\u202f2 is \u201ckeeping\u201d not only item 3 but also all of item 5. So my counteroffer that \u201cgives\u201d him only item 3 ([0, 0, 7, 0, 0]) deprives him of item 5.\n\n5. If I counteroffer so as to keep all of item 5, my utility is good for me; however, it would be less attractive for Player\u202f2 when compared to his own offer in Round\u202f1 (he would have lost his \u201cbonus\u201d of item 5). In order to entice him to accept a counteroffer, I would logically have to concede some of the items he values. Yet even minimal concessions (e.g. giving him a unit from item 5) would drop my total value into a region (when discounting is applied) that is lower than my outside option of 867.\n\n6. Thus, if I try to \u201cbuy\u201d agreement by conceding enough to reward Player\u202f2 with a share similar to his previous offer, my post\u2010discount value falls below 867. Conversely, if I propose a deal that keeps nearly everything I value (for example, a counteroffer of [0, 0, 7, 0, 0] so that I get items [2,1,0,4,3] for myself, valued at 906 pre\u2010discount or about 888 post\u2010discount), then Player\u202f2 loses the extra value from item 5 that he previously secured. As a rational responder, he is unlikely to accept a deal that gives him less than his original proposal.\n\n7. Comparing all outcomes:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Accepting the current offer gives me about 664.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Crafting a counteroffer that would yield me a post\u2010discount value above 867 forces me to keep all of the high\u2013value items. But such an offer (for example [0, 0, 7, 0, 0]) is far less attractive to Player\u202f2 than his earlier offer because it gives him nothing of item 5.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Consequently, if I make a counteroffer, Player\u202f2 is likely to reject it and may then either counter in the final round (when proposals are even less flexible) or walk away. In either case my outcome would be determined by my outside option.\n\n8. Given that my outside offer is 867 (which is better than what I\u2019d get if I accept the current deal or if my counteroffer forces Player\u202f2 to try to extract additional value in further rounds) the rational action is to WALK away.\n\nThus, my action is to WALK.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

My outside option is only 68, so I have a very strong position. In contrast, Player\u00a02\u2019s private values are drawn from UNIF(1,101) so his expected per\u2010unit value is roughly 51 and his private outside offer (drawn from 1 to his full total value) will often be much higher than my 68. (If we assume his full item total is about 18\u00d751 \u2248 918, then his average outside offer is roughly \u00bd of that, near 459.) \n\nMy goal is to get as high a share of my 923 as possible while offering Player\u00a02 just enough extra value in the deal so that his share is competitive with his expected outside option. An effective strategy is to \u201cpay\u201d Player\u00a02 using items that hurt me little while (hopefully) giving him a relatively high value. Looking at my private per\u2010unit values:\n\u2003\u2022 Item\u00a01: I value each unit at 20 whereas an average opponent unit is worth about 51.\n\u2003\u2022 Item\u00a04: I only get 2 per unit while the opponent may get roughly 51.\nIn contrast, I highly value items 2 (95 per unit) and 5 (96 per unit) so I prefer to keep those. (Item\u00a03 is middling at 51, roughly average.)\n\nA minimal \u201cconcession\u201d bundle using the \u201ccheapest\u201d items for me is then to hand over all of item\u00a01 (5 units) and all of item\u00a04 (4 units). That bundle \u201ccosts\u201d me only 5\u00d720 + 4\u00d72 = 100 + 8 = 108 in my value while giving Player\u00a02 a bundle that (if his values are near the average) is worth 5\u00d751 + 4\u00d751 = 9\u00d751 = 459\u2014roughly equal to what he might expect from his outside option. Meanwhile I keep items 2, 3, and 5 (4+1+4 units) which give me 4\u00d795 + 1\u00d751 + 4\u00d796 = 380 + 51 + 384 = 815. This division clearly beats my outside option of 68.\n\nThus, my initial offer is to give Player\u00a02 all units of item\u00a01 and item\u00a04, and keep the remaining items. In the required response format I express the items offered to Player\u00a02 as the list [5, 0, 0, 4, 0].\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [5, 0, 0, 4, 0]}",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 2, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    84 x 0 + 64 x 0 + 97 x 0 + 41 x 2 + 24 x 1\n    which is 106 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 108. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [5, 0, 0, 4, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [5, 0, 0, 4, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

This means that in any deal I must get at least 747 in value (remember that in round\u202f1 there is no discount yet). In other words, any items I \u201cgive\u201d to Player\u00a02 must cost me no more than 757 \u2013 747 = 10 in my own \u201cpoints.\u201d\n\nLooking at my values per unit the only type that \u201churts\u201d me very little is item\u00a05 (worth 4 per unit to me). In fact, each unit of item\u00a05 I concede costs me only 4 points of value. (Every other item would cost me far more.) The smallest nonzero concession in item\u00a05 is 1 unit (a cost of 4, leaving me with 757\u00a0\u2013\u00a04 = 753, which is above my reservation), but as an initial offer it is very \u201cstingy\u201d for Player\u00a02. (On average, Player\u00a02\u2019s private value for each unit\u2014drawn uniformly from 1 to 101\u2014is roughly 51, and the expected value of their outside option is near half of what would be their \u201cfull\u201d pot. So if I offered very little they would likely prefer to \u201cwalk away\u201d.)\n\nI have only a \u201cbudget\u201d of at most 10 points of concession. Conceding 2 units of item\u00a05 costs me 2\u00b74 = 8 points, leaving me with 757 \u2013 8 = 749; this still gives me a small margin over my outside offer (749 > 747) while offering Player\u00a02 something that (if they have even a moderate private value for item\u00a05) is considerably more than nothing. Conceding 3 units of item\u00a05 would cost 12 points (leaving me with 745), which is below my outside option, so that is out of the question.\n\nThus, with the limited \u201cconcession budget\u201d I have, my best initial offer is to give Player\u00a02 2 units of item\u00a05 (and nothing else), keeping all the other items for myself. (Note that the offer is given as the amounts I offer to Player\u00a02.) This offer is valid since it does not exceed the available quantities ([0,\u202f0,\u202f0,\u202f0,\u202f2] is within [4,\u202f1,\u202f3,\u202f3,\u202f7]). \n\nSo my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 2]}",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 1, 3, 1, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    69 x 2 + 73 x 1 + 100 x 3 + 6 x 1 + 45 x 6\n    which is 787 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 789. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "I want to start by outlining a few points of my reasoning. Both players know exactly how many units of each item there are and I know my own per\u2010unit values. (My total \u201cown\u201d value for everything is 1297, and my outside option is 459.) In round 1 there is no current offer on the table so I must propose an \u201cinitial offer\u201d \u2013 that is, I must specify how many units of each item I\u2019d be \u201cgiving\u201d to Player 2 (with the understanding that I then receive the remaining units).\n\nEven though Player 2\u2019s actual per\u2010unit values are private and drawn uniformly from 1 to 101, a reasonable approach is to \u201csplit\u201d the surplus so that my proposal gives Player 2 at least as much (when they eventually discount future rounds) as they might expect by waiting (or by walking away and getting their private outside offer). In view of the discount factor (\u03b3 = 0.98 per round) and the fact that if we fail an agreement both players \u201cfall back\u201d to their outside offer, a fair\u2013but slightly self\u2010favored\u2013division is one which roughly splits the overall surplus (here 1297) in a way that gives Player 2 an offer that is at least competitive with what they might get on expectation.\n\nFor example, if I \u201chand over\u201d a package of items that according to my own valuations is close to 50% of the overall value (or a little more so that Player 2 is motivated to accept rather than delay), then I am both safeguarding my own outcome (since I get about 669) and making the offer attractive. One plausible division is to offer Player 2 these quantities:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 1 (5 available): offer 2 units\u2003\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 2 (3 available): offer 1 unit\u2003\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 3 (7 available): offer 4 units\u2003\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 4 (4 available): offer 2 units\u2003\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 5 (1 available): offer 1 unit\n\nUnder this proposal my \u201cpackage\u201d (what I keep) is:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 1: 3 units, Item 2: 2 units, Item 3: 3 units, Item 4: 2 units, Item 5: 0 units.\nAccording to my own values this gives me a payoff of:\n\u20033\u00d743 (129) + 2\u00d774 (148) + 3\u00d770 (210) + 2\u00d791 (182) = 669,\nwhich is well above my outside option of 459. Meanwhile, the package I\u2019m giving Player 2 is worth (by my own evaluation):\n\u20032\u00d743 (86) + 1\u00d774 (74) + 4\u00d770 (280) + 2\u00d791 (182) + 1\u00d76 (6) = 628.\nThis division keeps the \u201cpie\u201d nearly balanced from the perspective of Player 2\u2019s potential alternatives while leaving me a slight advantage as the first mover.\n\nThus, my action is to propose this division.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 4, 2, 1]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 428. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 669 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 7, 2, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    59 x 1 + 37 x 0 + 38 x 7 + 13 x 2 + 76 x 1\n    which is 427 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 428. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 4, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 4, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To determine the appropriate action, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n### 1) Analyze the current situation:\n\n- **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 428.\n- **Values of the Items:**\n  - Item 1: 59 per unit\n  - Item 2: 37 per unit\n  - Item 3: 38 per unit\n  - Item 4: 13 per unit\n  - Item 5: 76 per unit\n- **Total Pool of Items:**\n  - Item 1: 5 units\n  - Item 2: 3 units\n  - Item 3: 7 units\n  - Item 4: 4 units\n  - Item 5: 1 unit\n- **Discount Factor:** The discount factor is 0.98, which implies that if I wait to accept in later rounds, the value of the deal I accept will be slightly reduced. However, it's currently round 1, so the discount factor does not yet apply.\n\n### 2) Assess the value of offers:\n\n- **Current Offer:** Player 1 is offering me [2, 1, 4, 2, 1]. Let's calculate the value to me:\n  - 2 units of item 1: 2 * 59 = 118\n  - 1 unit of item 2: 1 * 37 = 37\n  - 4 units of item 3: 4 * 38 = 152\n  - 2 units of item 4: 2 * 13 = 26\n  - 1 unit of item 5: 1 * 76 = 76\n  - Total Value = 118 + 37 + 152 + 26 + 76 = 409\n\n- **Comparison with Outside Offer:** The value of the current offer (409) is less than my outside offer (428), so accepting would be worse than my fallback option.\n\n- **Potential Counteroffer:** I should try to develop a counteroffer that yields my value higher than 428. Let\u2019s explore:\n\n  If I propose keeping [3, 2, 3, 3, 1], then:\n  - 3 units of item 1: 3 * 59 = 177\n  - 2 units of item 2: 2 * 37 = 74\n  - 3 units of item 3: 3 * 38 = 114\n  - 3 units of item 4: 3 * 13 = 39\n  - 1 unit of item 5: 1 * 76 = 76\n  - Total Value = 177 + 74 + 114 + 39 + 76 = 480\n\n480 is greater than my outside offer of 428, so this configuration is better for me than walking away.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision:\n\nSince the current offer is worse than my outside offer, I should propose a counteroffer that improves my payoff beyond my outside offer. Based on the calculations above, it makes sense to make the following counteroffer:\n\nI will keep [3, 2, 3, 3, 1] and offer Player 1 the remaining [2, 1, 4, 1, 0].\n\nTherefore, my action is:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 4, 1, 0]}\n```",

In contrast, if we can agree on a division then (with no discounting in round\u20111) we would like a deal that gives us a significantly higher payoff. Although we do not know Player\u202f2\u2019s private values (or their outside offer), we can estimate that if their per\u2010unit values are drawn uniformly from 1 to 101 then on average each unit is worth roughly 51 to them so that if they got all items (22 units) their full value would be around 22\u00d751\u22481122. Their outside offer is drawn uniformly from 1 up to that total so its expectation is roughly half that (\u2248561). In a first\u2010round offer it is very important to give Player\u202f2 at least an \u201cin the ball\u2010park\u201d payoff so that accepting your deal is better than risking their outside offer (and the discount that arises in later rounds).\n\nFrom my perspective the total \u201craw\u201d value if I got everything would be 1447. But I too care about leaving a deal on the table that is acceptable to Player\u202f2. To maximize my payoff while \u201cbuying\u201d Player\u202f2\u2019s acceptance I want to assign them the items I value relatively less. In my private values item\u20113 is most precious (93 per unit) so I want to keep all of that if possible. I also value item\u20111 (74 per unit) fairly highly so I\u2019d prefer to keep most of that. On the other hand, my valuations for item\u20114 (51) and item\u20115 (50) are lower, so I am willing to let Player\u202f2 have more of these. (Item\u20112 is in between with a value of 73, and partly giving it away would help if Player\u202f2 happens to value it around average.)\n\nA division that achieves these goals is to offer Player\u202f2:\n \u2022 1 unit of item 1 (leaving 2 for me),\n \u2022 5 units of item 2 (leaving 3 for me),\n \u2022 0 units of item 3 (so I keep all 2 units because they are my most valuable),\n \u2022 4 units of item 4 (leaving 1 for me),\n \u2022 2 units of item 5 (leaving 2 for me).\n\nThis gives Player 2 a total of 1+5+0+4+2 = 12 items. If we assume roughly an average of 51 per unit for them, that corresponds to an approximate payoff around 612, which should be attractive given that their expected outside offer would be on the order of 561. Meanwhile my own items come out to:\n \u2022 Item 1: 2\u00d774 = 148\n \u2022 Item 2: 3\u00d773 = 219\n \u2022 Item 3: 2\u00d793 = 186\n \u2022 Item 4: 1\u00d751 = 51\n \u2022 Item 5: 2\u00d750 = 100\nFor a total of 148+219+186+51+100 = 704, which is well above my outside offer of 389.\n\nThus, as my round\u20111 move I will propose the following offer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 5, 0, 4, 2]}",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 9. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 9. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1062 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    77 x 0 + 64 x 0 + 82 x 0 + 99 x 0 + 32 x 0\n    which is 0 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 9. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 5, 0, 4, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 5, 0, 4, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

The discounted value for accepting in round 2 would be multiplied by 0.98, and 0.98^2 for round 3.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n#### Current Offer ([1, 5, 0, 4, 2] to you):\n- 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 77 = 77\n- 5 units of item 2 = 5 \u00d7 64 = 320\n- 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 82 = 0\n- 4 units of item 4 = 4 \u00d7 99 = 396\n- 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 32 = 64\n\n**Total Value of Current Offer** = 77 + 320 + 0 + 396 + 64 = 857\n\nSince 857 is much higher than your outside offer of 9 and not discounted, it is significantly advantageous in this round.\n\n#### Comparison:\n- Current Offer Value = 857\n- Outside Offer Value = 9\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision Based on the Analysis\n\nGiven that the current offer provides a value of 857 to you, which is far greater than your outside offer of 9, accepting this offer is clearly advantageous. Delaying action would result in discounted future offers where the total value would decrease due to the discount factor, making the current offer even more appealing.\n\nTherefore, the optimal decision is to accept the current offer, as it exceeds the value of your outside offer and any potential risk associated with waiting for better offers.\n\n**Action**: {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

I know my own values very well (item 1: 88, item 2: 53, item 3: 44, item 4: 93, item 5: 99) and the totals are 4, 2, 5, 4, and 6 respectively. (If I got everything I\u2019d have 1644, but my private outside offer is only 355 so I must get a deal allocated much above that.) Meanwhile, although I do not know Player 2\u2019s exact values, each of their values is drawn uniformly from 1 to 101 so the average per unit is roughly 51. (If they received all items they\u2019d be around 4\u00b751+2\u00b751+5\u00b751+4\u00b751+6\u00b751 = 21\u00b751 \u2248 1071. Their private outside offer is drawn uniformly from 1 to their total value, so typically they would be around half that, perhaps about 535.) \n\nIn choosing an initial proposal, I want to keep for myself the items that are very valuable to me (items 1, 4, and 5) while conceding a bit more of the items that matter less (items 2 and 3). One reasonable \u201cfair\u2010split\u201d division in expected terms is to offer Player 2 an allocation whose total units (times an average 51) is in the 535\u2013565 range. For example, if I propose offering [2, 1, 3, 2, 3] (meaning I am giving Player 2 2 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 2 of item 4, and 3 of item 5), then the totals are: \n\n\u2003\u2022 For Player 2 the total units = 2+1+3+2+3 = 11, and on average their \u201cvalue\u201d would be near 11\u00d751 = 561, which is in the right ballpark relative to what they might expect otherwise. \n\n\u2003\u2022 For myself I keep the remainders: item 1: 4\u20132 = 2, item 2: 2\u20131 = 1, item 3: 5\u20133 = 2, item 4: 4\u20132 = 2, item 5: 6\u20133 = 3. My total value then is 2\u00d788 + 1\u00d753 + 2\u00d744 + 2\u00d793 + 3\u00d799 = 176 + 53 + 88 + 186 + 297 = 800, which is substantially above my outside option and quite attractive given that I will not suffer discounting because we are in round 1. \n\nThis allocation strikes a balance between being aggressive (keeping my highest\u2010value items as much as possible) and being \u201cfair\u201d enough that Player 2 is likely to accept rather than risk a lower discounted deal in later rounds.\n\nTherefore, my action will be to make the counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 3, 2, 3]}",

                    "response": "Step 1: Let\u2019s first look at the numbers.\n\u2022 There are a total of 3, 6, 3, 5, and 7 units for items 1\u20135 respectively; if an offer \u201ca\u201d is made (where a = [a\u2081, a\u2082, a\u2083, a\u2084, a\u2085] are the amounts offered to Player\u202f2), then Player\u202f1 would receive (3\u2013a\u2081, 6\u2013a\u2082, 3\u2013a\u2083, 5\u2013a\u2084, 7\u2013a\u2085).\n\u2022 My private per\u2010unit values are: item1 = 77, item2 = 38, item3 = 66, item4 = 66, and item5 = 98.\n\u2022 Thus if I were to \u201ctake everything,\u201d my total value would be 3\u00b777 + 6\u00b738 + 3\u00b766 + 5\u00b766 + 7\u00b798 = 1673. (This is given.)\n\u2022 My outside offer (what I get if negotiations break down) is 1219. That means any deal I accept must let me score at least 1219 (after discounting, but in round 1 there is no discount).\n\nStep 2: Consider the reservation \u201cpie\u201d for each player.\n\u2022 If negotiations break down then I get 1219.\n\u2022 Although Player\u202f2\u2019s exact outside offer is unknown (drawn uniformly between 1 and their total possible value), note that the expected full\u2010pie value for an opponent with values drawn uniformly from 1 to 101 would be around 24\u00d751 = 1224 and so an \u201caverage\u201d outside offer is roughly \u00bd\u00b71224 \u2248 612.\n\u2022 Thus if I want Player\u202f2 to prefer our deal over walking away, the offer must give them something around (or ideally above) their reservation. (I cannot know their exact number, so\u2014being the advantaged first mover and holding a very high outside offer\u2014I may try to \u201cpush\u201d a demanding offer.)\n\nStep 3: Designing my counteroffer.\n\u2022 I want to claim as much as possible while ensuring my own value is at least 1219.\n\u2022 My \u201cbest\u201d items (most valuable to me) are items 5 (98/unit), item 1 (77/unit) and then items 3 and 4 (66/unit). In contrast, item 2 is my \u201ccheapest\u201d at 38/unit.\n\u2022 To maximize what I keep (and thus secure more than 1219), I want to keep all of the high\u2010value items.\n\u2022 A natural idea is to \u201cgive\u201d Player\u202f2 the items I value relatively little: namely, all units of item 2 (6 units) and, from the remaining items, consider giving away the ones that would \u201ccost\u201d me less.\n\u2022 One reasonable (if aggressive) division is as follows:\n\u2003\u2013 Give Player\u202f2 all of item 2 (6 units).\n\u2003\u2013 In addition, give Player\u202f2 all of item 3 (3 units).\n\u2003\u2013 Retain full ownership of items 1, 4, and 5.\n\u2022 Let\u2019s check the result from my perspective:\n\u2003\u2013 My allocation becomes:\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 3 units\u2003\u2192 3\u00d777 = 231  \n\u2003\u2003Item 2: 0 units\u2003\u2192 0\u00d738 = 0  \n\u2003\u2003Item 3: 0 units\u2003\u2192 0\u00d766 = 0  \n\u2003\u2003Item 4: 5 units\u2003\u2192 5\u00d766 = 330  \n\u2003\u2003Item 5: 7 units\u2003\u2192 7\u00d798 = 686  \n\u2003\u2003Total = 231 + 330 + 686 = 1247.\n\u2022 This 1247 is above my outside offer of 1219, so (from my perspective) this deal is acceptable.\n\u2022 From Player\u202f2\u2019s perspective, they get:\n\u2003\u2003Item 2: 6 units and Item 3: 3 units, a total of 9 units.\n\u2003\u2013 If we (very roughly) assume that on average the opponent \u201cvalues\u201d a unit around 51 (the average of 1 and 101), then their \u201cshare\u201d is around 9\u00d751 = 459. This is below the \u201caverage\u201d resistance level of about 612.\n\u2022 Hence, while this offer is very aggressive (and it may well be rejected by Player\u202f2 if their private outside offer is above what they\u2019d get here), it is a maximal extraction offer on my part that gives me 1247 (a bit more than my outside option) and leaves me little to concede. As the first mover with a strong reservation payoff, I choose to press my advantage.\n\nStep 4: Conclusion\nI will propose the following division as my initial counteroffer. (Recall that the list in the offer represents the units I\u2019m offering to Player\u202f2 for items 1\u20135 respectively.)\n\nThus, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 6, 3, 0, 0]}",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 747. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 747. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 633 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 5, 3, 5, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    9 x 0 + 39 x 5 + 60 x 3 + 55 x 5 + 48 x 2\n    which is 746 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 747. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 6, 3, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 6, 3, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To decide on my action, let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 747.\n   - My values per unit for each item are:\n     - Item 1: 9\n     - Item 2: 39\n     - Item 3: 60\n     - Item 4: 55\n     - Item 5: 48\n   - The total pool of items is:\n     - Item 1: 3\n     - Item 2: 6\n     - Item 3: 3\n     - Item 4: 5\n     - Item 5: 7\n   - The discount factor gamma = 0.98 influences the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers. It slightly reduces the value of future outcomes in subsequent rounds.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer: [0, 6, 3, 0, 0]\n     - Value to me if I accept:\n       - 0 units of item 1 = 0 x 9 = 0\n       - 6 units of item 2 = 6 x 39 = 234\n       - 3 units of item 3 = 3 x 60 = 180\n       - 0 units of item 4 = 0 x 55 = 0\n       - 0 units of item 5 = 0 x 48 = 0\n     - Total value = 234 + 180 = 414\n   - Compare to my outside offer value of 747:\n     - The current offer value (414) is significantly less than my outside offer value (747).\n   \n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - I should not accept the current offer because its value (414) is less than my outside offer (747).\n   - I should not walk away immediately because it is the first round, and there is potential to negotiate a better outcome.\n   - I should propose a counteroffer that yields a value greater than 747.\n\nTo avoid Mistake 2 (making an offer worse for me than my outside offer), I need to propose a counteroffer with a value higher than 747. Let's construct a counteroffer:\n\n- If I keep 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 7 units of item 5, I can calculate:\n  - Value = (0 x 9) + (0 x 39) + (3 x 60) + (3 x 55) + (7 x 48)\n  - Value = 0 + 0 + 180 + 165 + 336\n  - Total value = 681\n\nThis is again lower than my outside offer. To get a value over 747, I will keep all units of item 3, 4, and some from item 5. \n\nIf I keep 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5:\n  - Value = (0 x 9) + (0 x 39) + (3 x 60) + (5 x 55) + (4 x 48)\n  - Value = 0 + 0 + 180 + 275 + 192\n  - Total value = 647\n\nLet's keep 5 units of item 5 to get a higher value:\nIf I keep 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 5 units of item 5:\n  - Value = (0 x 9) + (0 x 39) + (3 x 60) + (5 x 55) + (5 x 48)\n  - Value = 0 + 0 + 180 + 275 + 240\n  - Total value = 695\n\nI'll continue to adjust the items to find a solution over 747. I must iterate until it aligns above.\n\nIf I keep 3 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and full item 5:\n  - Value = (0 x 9) + (0 x 39) + (3 x 60) + (5 x 55) + (7 x 48)\n  - Value = 0 + 0 + 180 + 275 + 336\n  - Total value = 791\n\nThe division I now end up with:\n  - Offer: [3, 6, 0, 0, 0]\n \nThe value is 791 compared to outside offer of 747.

                    "response": "Step 1: Let\u2019s determine the immediate value to me if I ACCEPT the current offer. The current offer on the table gives me [3, 6, 0, 0, 0] units of items 1 through 5. My private per\u2010unit values are: item 1 = 77, item 2 = 38, item 3 = 66, item 4 = 66, item 5 = 98. So my raw value would be\n\u2003\u20033\u00d777 + 6\u00d738 = 231 + 228 = 459.\nSince we\u2019re in round 2 and the discount factor is \u03b3 = 0.98 (applied as \u03b3^(r\u20131) with r = 2) the outcome is worth 459\u00d70.98 \u2248 449.82.\nMy private outside option is 1219, so accepting 449.82 (discounted) is far worse.\n\nStep 2: As my counteroffer I want a deal that provides me with a \u201craw\u201d value that, after discounting by 0.98, is at least as good as 1219. In other words, I need a raw value V such that\n\u2003\u20030.98\u00d7V \u2265 1219\u2003\u27f9\u2003V \u2265 1219/0.98 \u2248 1245.9.\n(Recall that my total maximum raw value if I got everything would be 1673.)\n\nStep 3: In a counteroffer I specify what I would give to Player 2; whatever I do not offer goes to me. The full available items are: [3, 6, 3, 5, 7]. If my counteroffer is [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5] (units given to Player 2), then I receive:\n\u2003\u2003item 1: 3 \u2013 o1,\n\u2003\u2003item 2: 6 \u2013 o2,\n\u2003\u2003item 3: 3 \u2013 o3,\n\u2003\u2003item 4: 5 \u2013 o4,\n\u2003\u2003item 5: 7 \u2013 o5.\nMy own raw value is then:\n\u2003\u200377\u00d7(3 \u2013 o1) + 38\u00d7(6 \u2013 o2) +\u00a066\u00d7(3 \u2013 o3) + 66\u00d7(5 \u2013 o4) + 98\u00d7(7 \u2013 o5).\nI need this value to be at least \u22481246.\n\nStep 4: I also consider that in round 1 Player 2 offered me [3,6,0,0,0] (which leaves him [0,0,3,5,7]). Although I don\u2019t have Player 2\u2019s private values, I know that if I make an extremely \u201clopsided\u201d offer (keeping too much for myself) he might prefer to get his outside offer. Thus I need to give him enough of items he might value while still ensuring I get at least 1246 raw value.\n\nStep 5: Noting that my highest valued items are item 1 (77 per unit) and item 5 (98 per unit), I prefer to keep these. I can concede more of items I value less\u2014item 2 is only worth 38 for me; items 3 and 4 are only 66 each. One plausible counteroffer is to give Player 2:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u20031 unit of item 1,\n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u20034 units of item 2,\n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u20031 unit of item 3,\n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u20032 units of item 4,\n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u20030 units of item 5.\nThen my allocation becomes:\n\u2003\u2003item 1: 3 \u2013 1 = 2\u2003\u2003(value: 2\u00d777 = 154),\n\u2003\u2003item 2: 6 \u2013 4 = 2\u2003\u2003(value: 2\u00d738 = 76),\n\u2003\u2003item 3: 3 \u2013 1 = 2\u2003\u2003(value: 2\u00d766 = 132),\n\u2003\u2003item 4: 5 \u2013 2 = 3\u2003\u2003(value: 3\u00d766 = 198),\n\u2003\u2003item 5: 7 \u2013 0 = 7\u2003\u2003(value: 7\u00d798 = 686).\nTotal raw value = 154 + 76 + 132 + 198 + 686 = 1246.\nAfter discounting in round 2, the value is 1246\u00d70.98 \u2248 1221.08, which slightly exceeds my outside offer of 1219.\n\nStep 6: This division not only meets my minimum requirement but also gives Player 2 a share including items (especially item 2 and some of items 3 and 4) that he might value, making the offer more likely to be acceptable for him.\n\nThus, my action is to propose the following counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 4, 1, 2, 0]}",
                    "action": "COUNTEROFFER"
                },
                {
                    "prompt": "\n    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\n    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\n    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\n    There are 3 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 7 units of item 5 to divide.\n    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\n    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 101.\n    Your private values are 9 for item 1, 39 for item 2, 60 for item 3, 55 for item 4, 48 for item 5.\n    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to your total value of all items, which is 1052. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 747. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 747. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 633 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 5, 3, 5, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    9 x 0 + 39 x 5 + 60 x 3 + 55 x 5 + 48 x 2\n    which is 746 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 747. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 6, 3, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 6, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 4, 1, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 4, 1, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Let's walk through the decision-making process step by step:\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n   - What is my outside offer value?\n     - My outside offer value is 747.\n   - What are the values of the items involved?\n     - Item 1: 9 per unit\n     - Item 2: 39 per unit\n     - Item 3: 60 per unit\n     - Item 4: 55 per unit\n     - Item 5: 48 per unit\n   - What is the total pool of items?\n     - 3 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 7 units of item 5.\n   - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n     - The discount factor (gamma) is 0.98, which means that for each round that passes without an agreement, the value of the agreement is multiplied by a decreasing factor due to the passage of time. Therefore, the value received in later rounds is slightly diminished by this factor.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - For the current offer: What is my total value if I accept it?\n     - According to Player 1's current offer [1, 4, 1, 2, 0], I'm being offered:\n       - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 9 = 9\n       - 4 units of item 2 = 4 \u00d7 39 = 156\n       - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 60 = 60\n       - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 55 = 110\n       - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 48 = 0\n     - Total value = 9 + 156 + 60 + 110 = 335\n      \n   - Apply the discount factor (since this is round 2, power (2-1) = 1):\n     - Value after discount = 335 \u00d7 0.98 = 328.3\n\n   - Compare this value to my outside offer of 747.\n\n   - The current offer's discounted value (328.3) is significantly lower than my outside offer (747).\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - Should I accept the current offer?\n     - No, because the value (328.3) is much lower than my outside offer (747).\n   - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n     - I should consider counteroffer strategies before deciding to walk.\n   - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n   Now, I will determine a counteroffer. I must ensure the value I keep is greater than 747 to avoid Mistake 2.\n\n   Possible counteroffer: Offer Player 1 some units of item 1 and 4, keeping all items of higher personal value (items 2, 3, and 5):\n\n   - Counteroffer: [2, 0, 0, 2, 7]\n   - This means I keep [1, 6, 3, 3, 0]\n     - My value: \n       - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 9 = 9\n       - 6 units of item 2 = 6 \u00d7 39 = 234\n       - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 60 = 180\n       - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 55 = 165\n       - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 48 = 0\n     - Total value = 9 + 234 + 180 + 165 = 588\n\n   - 588 is still less than my outside offer of 747. I need to keep more valuable items.\n\n   Modified counteroffer: Offer Player 1  all items of least value to me, maximizing my value.\n\n   - Counteroffer: [0, 6, 0, 0, 7]\n   - This means I keep [3, 0, 3, 5, 0], and my value would be:\n     - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27\n     - 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 39 = 0\n     - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 60 = 180\n     - 5 units of item 4 = 5 \u00d7 55 = 275\n     - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 48 = 0\n     - Total value = 27 + 180 + 275 = 482\n\n   My offer is still less than 747. I need one more adjustment.\n\n   Modified counteroffer: \n   - Counteroffer: Offering item 1 entirely and all item 4 to maximize overall value.\n   - Offer [3, 5, 0, 0, 0], \n   - Now, I keep [0, 1, 3, 5, 7], yielding:\n     - 0 units of item 1 = 0\n     - 1 units of item 2 = 39\n     - 3 units of item 3 = 180\n     - 5 units of item 4 = 55\n     - 7 units of item 5 = 336\n     - Total value = 39 + 180 + 336 = 615 \n   The total is still lower, none of combinations provides higher valuation than 747. \n\nSo, rather than countering with unevaluated options, I should avoid impacting the outside offer.\n\nThe best course of action is to walk:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",
