                    "response": "I will first explain my reasoning in a step\u2010by\u2010step fashion.\n\n1. I know the totals are:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 4 units\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 3 units\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 5 units\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 2 units\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 4 units\n\n2. My private values per unit are:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 60\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 91\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 61\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 31\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 3\nIf I got everything I\u2019d have 892 points. I have an outside option of 625 so any \u201cdeal\u2010value\u201d I get must beat that reservation.\n\n3. In these negotiations each player\u2019s valuations are private; the opponent\u2019s values (and their outside offer) are randomly drawn. Their expected per\u2010unit value (from a uniform draw between 1 and 101) is around 51. Thus even though I value some items highly the opponent might not\u2014and vice versa. I can use that asymmetry to design a division that protects my interests without \u201cstarving\u201d them relative to what they might expect if they walked away.\n\n4. My strongest items (by my own valuations) are items 1 and 2 (60 and 91 per unit, respectively) and item 3 is still moderately high (61 per unit). In contrast, I personally don\u2019t care much about items 4 (31) and especially item 5 (3). At the same time, because the opponent\u2019s per\u2010unit value is uncertain (but likely around 51 on average) they might view even items that are \u201ccheap\u201d to me as having decent value.\n\n5. As a first move I want to keep most of my high\u2010valued items for myself while offering the opponent a \u201cpackage\u201d that is roughly competitive with what they could expect on average from a random outside offer. In rough expected terms, the opponent\u2019s full bundle would be worth around 918 (if we assume an average of 51 per unit over 18 total units) and their outside offer is drawn uniformly from 1 to that total value (so roughly a 50% average \u2013 near 459). \n\n6. With that in mind I craft an offer where:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 I keep all of items 1 and 2.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 I keep most of item 3 but concede a couple of units.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 I give away all of items 4 and 5.\nThis way, even though I give up items where I have low personal valuation (4 and 5), adding one or two extra units from item 3 boosts the opponent\u2019s package value. \n\n7. One division I considered is to offer the opponent:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 1 unit of item 1 (out of 4);\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 0 units of item 2 (out of 3);\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 2 units of item 3 (out of 5);\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 2 units of item 4 (all);\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 4 units of item 5 (all).\nAccordingly, I would then keep:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 3 units of item 1,\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 3 units of item 2,\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 3 units of item 3,\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 0 of items 4 and 5.\nMy own payoff under my valuations would be:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 1: 3 \u00d7 60 = 180\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 2: 3 \u00d7 91 = 273\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 3: 3 \u00d7 61 = 183\nAdding to a total of 636, which is safely above my outside option (625). \n\n8. For the opponent, if we assume an average of 51 per unit, the offer package is worth roughly:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 1 unit of item 1: 51\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 2 units of item 3: 102\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 2 units of item 4: 102\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 4 units of item 5: 204\nA rough total of 459 which is about the midpoint of what they might expect from their outside option. (Of course, their actual numbers are private; but from an expected\u2010value point of view this package could be acceptable.)\n\nBecause the negotiation has no discount effect this round (gamma^(r\u20131)=1 in round 1), and I want to maximize my share while offering something moderately attractive to the opponent, I choose the above offer.\n\nTherefore, my action in round 1 is to propose the following counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 2, 2, 4]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 673. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 840 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 3, 2, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    23 x 0 + 25 x 3 + 72 x 3 + 99 x 2 + 61 x 3\n    which is 672 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 673. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 2, 2, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 2, 2, 4]\n\n    What is your action?

This means that if the negotiation proceeds into further rounds, the present value of the future offers will be discounted, making it less valuable.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer from Player 1: I'm being offered [1, 0, 2, 2, 4].\n     - Value to me if I accept:\n       - Item 1: 1 \u00d7 23 = 23\n       - Item 2: 0 \u00d7 25 = 0\n       - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 72 = 144\n       - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 99 = 198\n       - Item 5: 4 \u00d7 61 = 244\n     - Total value if accepted: 23 + 0 + 144 + 198 + 244 = 609\n   \n   - Comparing with my outside offer: 609 (current offer) < 673 (outside offer)\n\n3) Make a decision based on analysis:\n   - Since the current offer value (609) is less than my outside offer value (673), I should not accept the current offer.\n   - Walking away is a choice since my outside offer is greater than the current offer. \n   - I should consider potential counteroffers that yield a higher value than my outside offer.\n\nTo avoid mistakes, especially mistake 2, where we make an offer worse for ourselves than the outside offer, I need to create a counteroffer that results in a value greater than 673.\n\nPossible counteroffer:\n- Suppose I keep 3 units of item 3, all units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5, and offer the rest to Player 1:\n  - My kept items:\n    - Item 1: 0 units kept = 0\n    - Item 2: 0 units kept = 0\n    - Item 3: 3 units kept = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216\n    - Item 4: 2 units kept = 2 \u00d7 99 = 198\n    - Item 5: 3 units kept = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183\n  - Total value to me: 0 + 0 + 216 + 198 + 183 = 597 (this is not greater than 673, iterate again).\n  \nLet's try another proposal:\n- Offering Player 1: [2, 2, 2, 0, 2], keeping [2, 1, 3, 2, 2] for myself:\n  - My kept items:\n    - Item 1: 2 x 23 = 46\n    - Item 2: 1 x 25 = 25\n    - Item 3: 3 x 72 = 216\n    - Item 4: 2 x 99 = 198\n    - Item 5: 2 x 61 = 122\n  - Total value to me: 46 + 25 + 216 + 198 + 122 = 607 (still not greater than 673).\n\nLet's make sure to propose an actually feasible distribution:\n- I need to try keeping a more beneficial distribution:\n\nFinalize a better counteroffer such as:\n- Propose a better option like [3, 2, 2, 0, 2], keeping [1, 1, 3, 2, 2] for myself:\n  - My kept items:\n    - Item 1: 1 x 23 = 23\n    - Item 2: 1 x 25 = 25\n    - Item 3: 3 x 72 = 216\n    - Item 4: 2 x 99 = 198\n    - Item 5: 2 x 61 = 122\n  - Total value to me: 23 + 25 + 216 + 198 + 122 = 584 (continue to search for better).\n\nAs iterative attempts are necessary, the process takes refining.

My proposed counteroffer [0, 0, 3, 1, 3] would instead give Player 2 only 3 units of item 3 (instead of 5), 1 unit of item 4 (instead of 2) and 3 units of item 5 (instead of 4). Without knowing Player 2\u2019s private valuations it is a risky move to \u201ctake away\u201d several units on items they likely value highly. In other words, if I try to improve my share by reducing what you\u2019d get compared to your current proposal, you might very well reject it and then the negotiation would continue into a further round with further discounting (or you might insist on a counteroffer of your own or eventually walk away), leaving me only my outside option of 625.\n\nGiven that the current offer would give me a discounted value of only about 503 \u2013 substantially below my secure outside offer of 625 \u2013 and that any counteroffer I might try risks a breakdown if Player 2 won\u2019t budge from the attractive bundle they already control (items 3, 4 and 5, which I must \u201ctake\u201d from you to improve my hand), the safest and most rational course of action for me is not to continue negotiations at these terms. \n\nTherefore, I choose to WALK away.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

I value items 1\u20133 very much (81, 73, and 98 per unit, respectively) compared to items 4 and 5 (16 and 22 per unit). Since I have 2, 3, and 2 available of items 1,2,3, if I keep all of these I obtain 2\u00d781 + 3\u00d773 + 2\u00d798 = 162 + 219 + 196 = 577. In contrast, each player\u2019s other items (item4:5 units and item5:7 units) have a combined total (in my eyes) of 5\u00d716 + 7\u00d722 = 80 + 154 = 234. But notice that Player 2\u2019s private values are drawn uniformly from 1 to 101 (with a mean around 51 per unit) so these items are expected (for them) to be worth roughly 5\u00d751 + 7\u00d751 = 612.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 0, 1, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    20 x 0 + 85 x 3 + 17 x 0 + 37 x 1 + 89 x 6\n    which is 826 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 827. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 5, 7]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 5, 7]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "I'll explain my reasoning. My goal is to propose an initial division that \u201cbuys\u201d player\u00a02\u2019s agreement while keeping my own \u201cdiscounted\u201d value comfortably above my outside option of 715. (Recall that if no deal is reached both players get their outside offers.) In our case my total value if I kept everything would be 1359, and my per\u2010unit values are higher on some items than on others. In particular, compared to my \u201cown\u201d value per unit, the items I value most are items\u00a02 (93 per unit), item\u00a01 (75 per unit) and item\u00a05 (78 per unit); in contrast item\u00a03 is worth 56 and item\u00a04 only 33 to me. (Meanwhile, for player\u00a02 each unit is drawn from a uniform range [1,101], so the expected per\u2010unit value is roughly about 51.) \n\nBecause I want to maximize my own gain while \u201cincentivizing\u201d player\u00a02 to accept (given that if they reject they may eventually walk away using their outside offer) I want to give them \u201ccheap\u201d items from my perspective\u2014that is, items where my advantage is small or even negative. For example, item\u00a04 is very low for me (33 per unit) and so giving player\u00a02 all of it costs me very little while raising their immediate payoff. Next, item\u00a03 gives me only 56 per unit so that if I hand most or all of it over I suffer less \u201closs\u201d relative to the (expected) 51 per unit that player\u00a02 might otherwise get from waiting. In contrast I want to keep items\u00a01, 2 and most of item\u00a05 because my premium on these is higher. \n\nI worked out a candidate allocation as follows. All totals are \u201cunits\u201d available:\n\u2003\u2022 Item\u00a01 (total 3): I keep all 3.\n\u2003\u2022 Item\u00a02 (total 2): I keep all 2.\n\u2003\u2022 Item\u00a03 (total 6): I give player\u00a02 all 6 units.\n\u2003\u2022 Item\u00a04 (total 2): I give player\u00a02 all 2 units.\n\u2003\u2022 Item\u00a05 (total 7): I keep 5 and give player\u00a02 2.\n\nUnder this proposal my allocation is:\n\u2003Item\u00a01: 3\u2003\u2192 3\u00d775 = 225\n\u2003Item\u00a02: 2\u2003\u2192 2\u00d793 = 186\n\u2003Item\u00a03: 0\u2003\u2192 0\u00d756 = 0\n\u2003Item\u00a04: 0\u2003\u2192 0\u00d733 = 0\n\u2003Item\u00a05: 5\u2003\u2192 5\u00d778 = 390\nTotal = 225 + 186 + 390 = 801, which is comfortably above my outside offer of 715.\n\nFor player\u00a02 the items they would get are:\n\u2003Item\u00a01: 0\n\u2003Item\u00a02: 0\n\u2003Item\u00a03: 6\u2003\u2192 expected \u2248 6\u00d751 = 306\n\u2003Item\u00a04: 2\u2003\u2192 expected \u2248 2\u00d751 = 102\n\u2003Item\u00a05: 2\u2003\u2192 expected \u2248 2\u00d751 = 102\nTotal expected \u2248 306 + 102 + 102 = 510.\nGiven that player\u00a02\u2019s private outside offer is a draw from 1 up to their total value (and on average about half of that total, close to 510) this division should be just acceptable to player\u00a02 (especially with the advantage of immediate resolution rather than discounting future rounds).\n\nThus, as Player\u00a01 in round 1 I make the following initial offer (which means \u201cI propose that player\u00a02 receive these units\u201d):\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 6, 2, 2]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 890. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1017 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 2, 1, 7] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    72 x 0 + 77 x 1 + 34 x 2 + 58 x 1 + 98 x 7\n    which is 889 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 890. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

In round 2 the discount factor is 0.98 so I need a raw outcome that, when multiplied by 0.98, gives me at least slightly more than 715. In other words, I\u2019d like to secure a raw value around 730\u2013740 (since 730\u00d70.98 \u2248716 and 740\u00d70.98 \u2248726). \n\nCurrently the offer on the table would give me [1,1,5,1,0] which by my own values is 1\u00d775+1\u00d793+5\u00d756+1\u00d733+0\u00d778 = 75+93+280+33 = 481\u2014far below my outside offer. So I must counter.\n\nEven though I have no complete insight into Player\u202f2\u2019s private values, I know their outside offer is drawn from their total value (expected around 1020 total, with an average of about 51 per unit) so their expected reservation is significantly lower than mine. In making my counteroffer I want to \u201ckeep\u201d for myself a raw value of about 730\u2013732 (so that 0.98\u00b7732 \u2248717.4, barely above my outside 715) while \u201cleaving\u201d Player\u202f2 an amount that is likely to beat their outside offer (and typical expected value) so that they have an incentive to agree rather than risk a next round discount or walking away.\n\nA natural way (given the items\u2019 values to me) is to give away the units I value less. I value items 1 (75/unit), 2 (93/unit) and 5 (78/unit) more than items 3 (56/unit) and 4 (33/unit). With that in mind one good candidate is to offer Player\u202f2 everything in items 3 and 4 (6 units of item\u202f3 and 2 units of item\u202f4 have a total \u201ccost\u201d of 6\u00d756+2\u00d733 = 336+66 = 402) plus 3 units of item\u202f1 (3\u00d775 = 225). That amounts to a total \u201cconcession\u201d of 402+225 = 627 by my measure. This leaves me with the remainder:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item\u202f1: 3\u20133 = 0\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item\u202f2: all 2 units (2\u00d793 = 186)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item\u202f3: 0 units\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item\u202f4: 0 units\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item\u202f5: all 7 units (7\u00d778 = 546)\nThus my raw value is 186+546 = 732, and discounted in round 2 that becomes about 0.98\u00d7732 \u2248717.4\u2014just above my outside offer.\nOn the flip side, Player\u202f2\u2019s \u201coffer\u201d (from my perspective) is:\n\u2003\u2003[3, 0, 6, 2, 0].\nEven though their private values differ from mine, this division gives them a significant share (three whole units of item 1, all of item 3 and 4) so that, given the typical value distribution they face, they are likely to do at least as well as their outside option.\n\nThus I choose to counterwith the offer I give above.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 0, 6, 2, 0]}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 890. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1017 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 2, 1, 7] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    72 x 0 + 77 x 1 + 34 x 2 + 58 x 1 + 98 x 7\n    which is 889 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 890. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 6, 2, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 5, 1, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [3, 0, 6, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 0, 6, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the current situation step by step.\n\n### 1) Analyze the current situation:\n\n- **What is my outside offer value?**  \n  My outside offer value is 890.\n\n- **What are the values of the items involved?**  \n  - Item 1: 72 per unit  \n  - Item 2: 77 per unit  \n  - Item 3: 34 per unit  \n  - Item 4: 58 per unit  \n  - Item 5: 98 per unit  \n\n- **What is the total pool of items?**  \n  - 3 units of item 1  \n  - 2 units of item 2  \n  - 6 units of item 3  \n  - 2 units of item 4  \n  - 7 units of item 5  \n\n- **How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?**  \n  The discount factor is 0.98. Since it's round 2, accepting now would multiply my value by \\(0.98^{(2-1)} = 0.98\\). The decision should account for this discounted value versus accepting in a future round.\n\n### 2) Assess the value of offers:\n\n- **For the current offer: [3, 0, 6, 2, 0]**  \n  My value if I accept this offer (post-discount):\n  - 3 units of item 1: \\(3 \\times 72 = 216\\)\n  - 0 units of item 2: \\(0 \\times 77 = 0\\)\n  - 6 units of item 3: \\(6 \\times 34 = 204\\)\n  - 2 units of item 4: \\(2 \\times 58 = 116\\)\n  - 0 units of item 5: \\(0 \\times 98 = 0\\)\n\n  Total value = \\(216 + 0 + 204 + 116 + 0 = 536\\)\n\n  Adjusting for the discount factor:  \n  Discounted value = \\(536 \\times 0.98 = 525.28\\)\n\n- **Comparing with my outside offer:**  \n  My outside offer value (890) is greater than the current discounted value (525.28).\n\n- **Potential counteroffers:**  \n  Let's explore what divisions would yield a total value higher than my outside offer of 890.\n\n  **Example of a potential counteroffer:**  \n  Offer Player 1: [0, 2, 4, 0, 5] (keeping 3 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5 for myself):\n  - 3 units of item 1: \\(3 \\times 72 = 216\\)  \n  - 0 units of item 2: \\(0 \\times 77 = 0\\)  \n  - 2 units of item 3: \\(2 \\times 34 = 68\\)  \n  - 2 units of item 4: \\(2 \\times 58 = 116\\)  \n  - 2 units of item 5: \\(2 \\times 98 = 196\\)  \n\n  Total value = \\(216 + 0 + 68 + 116 + 196 = 596\\)\n\n  The value is still below my outside offer of 890. Adjust discount factor:\n  - Discounted value = \\(596 \\times 0.98 = 584.08\\)\n\n  The counteroffer still does not meet my outside offer. Thus, I'll adjust item 5, since it has the highest unit value.\n\n### 3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n\nConsidering the current discounted offer value is below my outside offer value of 890 and that any reasonable counteroffer seems unlikely to result in a better deal in this round, the sensible choice now is to walk away.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

                    "response": "Step 1: My first step is to note that if no deal is reached, I walk away and secure 582 in value. (There is no discount penalty in Round 1.)  \nStep 2: If I make an offer that Player\u20052 accepts, my \u201cpie\u201d (the entire set of items) is worth 741 to me. To beat my outside offer I must keep at least 582 in my own valuation. In other words, the total \u201ccost\u201d (in my own numbers) of what I \u201cgive away\u201d must be no more than 741 \u2013 582 = 159.  \nStep 3: I want to induce acceptance by offering Player\u20052 a share that they (whose private values are drawn uniformly from 1 to 101) believe is at least as good as what they\u2019d get from their outside offer. (Player\u20052\u2019s total value for everything is on average about 510 \u2013 so their typical \u201coutside offer\u201d will be somewhere in the mid\u2010200\u2019s.)  \nStep 4: I control which items to use to \u201cbuy\u201d Player\u20052\u2019s acceptance. Ideally I should sacrifice items that are \u201ccheaper\u201d for me. My private values are:  \n\u2003item1 = 98\u2003\u2003(item count 3)  \n\u2003item2 = 100\u2003\u2003(item count 1)  \n\u2003item3 = 83\u2003\u2003(item count 3)  \n\u2003item4 = 46\u2003\u2003(item count 1)  \n\u2003item5 = 26\u2003\u2003(item count 2)  \nSo the \u201ccheapest\u201d items for me are item\u20055 (26 per unit) and then item\u20054 (46 per unit). By giving those away I \u201cspend\u201d little of my total value.  \nStep 5: One easily\u2013feasible offer is to offer Player\u20052 all of item\u20055 (2 units) and the single unit of item\u20054. That \u201csacrifice\u201d costs me 2\u00d726 + 46 = 52 + 46 = 98, which is well under 159.  \nStep 6: My allocation if the deal is accepted would then be:  \n\u2003Player\u20052 gets: item1:0, item2:0, item3:0, item4:1, item5:2.  \n\u2003I get the rest: item1:3, item2:1, item3:3, item4:0, item5:0.  \nMy own total value is then 3\u00d798 + 1\u00d7100 + 3\u00d783 = 294 + 100 + 249 = 643, which is above my outside offer of 582.  \nStep 7: Even though the expected \u201caverage\u201d value of the items to Player\u20052 (each unit having an expected value of about 51) would be roughly 3\u00d751 = 153 (which may be below their typical reservation), if Player\u20052\u2019s private draw is on the lower side they may well accept early. As the proposer I can be aggressive, knowing that if they reject and we move beyond Round\u20051 the discount factors will work against them and my eventual result defaults to my outside offer.  \nStep 8: In summary, my strategy is to offer the inexpensive items so that I maximize my own gain (643) while \u201cbuying\u201d just enough goodwill with a share that might be acceptable to the other party if their outside option is relatively low.  \n\nThus, my action in Round\u20051 is to make the following offer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 1, 2]}",

                    "response": "I'll explain my reasoning.\n\n1. First I calculate that if I got all the items my total is worth \n\u2003\u2003item 1: 2\u00d774 = 148  \n\u2003\u2003item 2: 2\u00d711 = 22  \n\u2003\u2003item 3: 3\u00d799 = 297  \n\u2003\u2003item 4: 6\u00d790 = 540  \n\u2003\u2003item 5: 4\u00d769 = 276\u2003  \ntotaling 1283. My outside alternative is 141, so any acceptable deal must give me more than that.\n\n2. In our negotiation each player\u2019s true values are private. Player 2\u2019s valuations are drawn uniformly from 1 to 101 so his expected per\u2010unit value is around 51. I want to \u201csteal\u201d as much surplus as I can while giving Player 2 a package that (in expectation) is at least as good as his fallback (his private outside offer) and his expectations for future rounds. With a discount factor close to 1 (0.98) I don\u2019t wish to delay.\n\n3. I note that my own per\u2010unit values differ widely between items. I value items 3 (99) and 4 (90) highly \u2013 so I want to keep as many of these as possible. I value item 2 at only 11 per unit so I am willing to offer all of it to Player 2. Item 1 (74) and item 5 (69) are moderately high, so a modest concession on those may help secure agreement.\n\n4. Based on this, I propose giving Player 2:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 1 unit of item 1 (out of 2)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 2 units of item 2 (all available)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 1 unit of item 3 (out of 3)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 1 unit of item 4 (out of 6)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 1 unit of item 5 (out of 4)  \n\nThis leaves me with:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 1 unit of item 1, 0 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 5 of item 4, and 3 of item 5.  \nWith my private values that gives me a value of:  \n\u2003\u20031\u00d774 + 2\u00d799 + 5\u00d790 + 3\u00d769 = 74 + 198 + 450 + 207 = 929,  \nwhich is well above my fallback of 141. It is also a reasonably attractive package (by expectation, roughly 306 in value if we estimate Player 2\u2019s unit values near 51) for Player 2 given the limited concessions and the fact that future rounds would imply some discounting.\n\nThus, with the trade\u2010off between keeping high\u2013value items for myself and offering enough to give Player 2 a better deal than his outside option, I decide on the following opening counteroffer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 1, 1, 1]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 488. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 747 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 1, 3, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    10 x 0 + 69 x 2 + 85 x 1 + 76 x 3 + 9 x 4\n    which is 487 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 488. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

On the other hand, we still want a deal better than our outside option.\n\nStep 3: Constructing an offer.\n\u2022 Splitting item 1: With a total of 2 units, we give 1 unit to Player 2.\n\u2022 Splitting item 2: With a total of 6 units, we give 3 units to Player 2.\n\u2022 Splitting item 3: With a total of 9 units, we give 5 units to Player 2 (making Player 2 slightly better off on this item to help secure agreement) and keep 4.\n\u2022 Splitting item 4: With a total of 6 units, we give 3 units to Player 2.\n\u2022 Splitting item 5: With a total of 3 units, we give 2 units to Player 2 and keep 1.\n\u2022 This offer gives Player 2 a bundle of [1, 3, 5, 3, 2] and leaves us with the remaining items [1, 3, 4, 3, 1].\n\nStep 4: Checking outcomes:\n\u2022 Our value: 1\u00d722 + 3\u00d774 + 4\u00d797 + 3\u00d710 + 1\u00d740 = 22 + 222 + 388 + 30 + 40 = 702. This exceeds our outside offer of 604.\n\u2022 Player 2\u2019s value (unknown, but if we assume an average per\u2011unit value \u224851, then 1\u00d751 + 3\u00d751 + 5\u00d751 + 3\u00d751 + 2\u00d751 = 714, which appears attractive).\n\nStep 5: Final decision.\n\u2022 In round 1, we propose the initial offer that gives Player 2 the bundle [1, 3, 5, 3, 2]. This is a reasonable starting position that both beats our reservation value and is likely acceptable to Player 2 based on an expected fair split.\n\nThus, our action is to make the following counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 3, 5, 3, 2]}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 6, 7, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    28 x 0 + 77 x 6 + 40 x 7 + 89 x 0 + 83 x 1\n    which is 825 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 826. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 5, 3, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 3, 5, 3, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

This is the baseline value I would receive if I choose to walk away.\n  \n- **Values of the Items**:\n  - Item 1: 28 per unit\n  - Item 2: 77 per unit\n  - Item 3: 40 per unit\n  - Item 4: 89 per unit\n  - Item 5: 83 per unit\n\n- **Total Pool of Items**:\n  - 2 units of item 1\n  - 6 units of item 2\n  - 9 units of item 3\n  - 6 units of item 4\n  - 3 units of item 5\n\n- **Current Offer Value**: \n  - Calculating the value of the current offer to me:\n    - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 28 = 28\n    - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231\n    - 5 units of item 3 = 5 \u00d7 40 = 200\n    - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267\n    - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 83 = 166\n  - Total value = 28 + 231 + 200 + 267 + 166 = 892\n\n- **Discount Factor**: Since this is round 1, the discount factor does not reduce the value yet (gamma^(1-1) = 1.00), so the value remains 892.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer**: The current offer's value to me is 892, which is greater than my outside offer value of 826.\n\n- **Comparison**: Since 892 > 826, accepting the current offer would provide more value than walking away.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\n- **Should I accept the current offer?** Yes, because the value of the current offer (892) is more than my outside offer (826).\n  \n- **Should I walk away?** No, as the current offer is more valuable than the outside offer.\n\n- **Should I propose a counteroffer?** Since the current offer already provides a higher value than my outside offer, a counteroffer is not necessary. Moreover, proposing a counteroffer could lead to successive rounds where the value might decrease due to the discount factor.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven that the current offer is better than my outside offer and provides a good value, the most rational decision is to accept the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

                    "response": "My reasoning is as follows. I want to secure a deal in round 1 that gives me a high personal total (my items\u2019 true total value is 777) while providing Player 2 just enough \u201cincentive\u201d compared to what they might expect from their private outside\u2010offer (which for them is drawn uniformly between 1 and their own total value). In my own evaluation I highly prize items 2 and 5 (92 and 95 per unit, respectively) and less\u2010value items 1 and 3 (9 and 32 per unit). Thus it makes sense to \u201csell\u201d the items that hurt me least if given away yet might be attractive in expectation for Player 2. (Without knowing their private numbers I assume the average per\u2010unit value is roughly 51, since values are uniform on [1,101].)\n\nA division in which I give away all 3 units of item 1 is very inexpensive for me (only 3\u00d79 = 27 loss) but in expectation would be worth about 3\u00d751 = 153 to Player 2. Similarly, giving them the single unit of item 3 costs me 32 (versus an expected 51 for Player 2). Also, while I\u2019d like to keep almost all of the high\u2010value items, I recognize that if Player 2\u2019s private outside option is based on receiving roughly half of the overall \u201cpie\u201d (their expected outside value is roughly (612+1)/2 \u2248 306 when they see all items, since the total expected value for them is 3\u00d751+4\u00d751+1\u00d751+1\u00d751+3\u00d751 = 612), then a \u201cjust\u2010barely\u2010acceptable\u201d deal for them would be one where the items I allocate sum in expected value roughly to 306. By considering the items where I can concede cheaply, I can achieve an offer that gives Player 2 an approximate expected value of 306. For example, by giving them all of item 1 (expected 153), the full unit of item 3 (expected 51), and also the full unit of item 4 or one unit of item 2 (each giving an expected 51), I reach an approximate expected value of 153+51+51 = 255 if I only give three types. That 255 seems a bit low relative to their likely outside offer. So instead I add one additional concession on one of the items. I propose giving them a single unit of item 2 rather than risking their rejection or delay. Thus, my proposed division is to offer to Player 2: all 3 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, the 1 unit of item 3, and the 1 unit of item 4, while keeping the remaining 3 units of item 2 and all 3 units of item 5 for myself. In my own valuation that leaves me with (3\u00d792)+(3\u00d795) = 276+285 = 561 (plus nothing from the items I conceded), and in expectation Player 2 receives items that (if their per\u2010unit value is around 51) total roughly 3\u00d751 + 1\u00d751 + 1\u00d751 + 1\u00d751 = 306 \u2013 making the deal competitive with what they might expect from walking away. (This is only a first\u2010round offer, and the discount factor of 0.98 is not yet operative.)\n\nThus my initial counteroffer is to offer Player 2 the items in quantities as follows:\n\u2003\u2022 item 1: 3 units\n\u2003\u2022 item 2: 1 unit\n\u2003\u2022 item 3: 1 unit\n\u2003\u2022 item 4: 1 unit\n\u2003\u2022 item 5: 0 units\n\nI therefore respond with:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 1, 1, 1, 0]}",

                    "response": "Step\u2010by\u2010step reasoning:\n1. We know the total items are: item1: 2 units, item2: 3, item3: 5, item4: 3, and item5: 5.\n2. My private per\u2010unit values are: item1 = 46, item2 = 62, item3 = 52, item4 = 5, and item5 = 69. My total value is 898, and my outside option is 196.\n3. In choosing my initial offer (which specifies what I give to Player 2), I want to secure a deal that gives me more than 196 while providing Player 2 a share at least as good as what they would expect from their outside option. Although I do not know Player 2\u2019s exact values, they are drawn from a uniform distribution [1,101] so the average per\u2010unit value is roughly 51.\n4. Because I value some items much more than others, I lean toward keeping most of the items on which I earn high value while offering more of the items on which my value is low. In my case item4 is only worth 5 to me but likely about 51 on average to Player 2. Conversely, item5 is very valuable to me (69) so I want to keep most of those units.\n5. A potential offer is to let Player 2 have:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 1/2 unit of item1 (i.e. 1 unit out of 2),\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 1 unit of item2 (out of 3),\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 3 units of item3 (out of 5),\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 all 3 units of item4,\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 and 1 unit of item5 (out of 5).\n6. With this offer, Player 2 would receive an expected value (using the rough 51 per unit average) of:\n\u2003\u2003Item1: 1\u00d751 = 51,\n\u2003\u2003Item2: 1\u00d751 = 51,\n\u2003\u2003Item3: 3\u00d751 = 153,\n\u2003\u2003Item4: 3\u00d751 = 153,\n\u2003\u2003Item5: 1\u00d751 = 51,\n\u2003\u2003Summing to approximately 459. This is around what one might expect for an opponent\u2019s outside or fallback value.\n7. My remainder would be:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item1: 1,\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item2: 2,\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item3: 2,\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item4: 0,\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item5: 4.\n\u2003This gives me a total value of:\n\u2003\u2003Item1: 1\u00d746 = 46,\n\u2003\u2003Item2: 2\u00d762 = 124,\n\u2003\u2003Item3: 2\u00d752 = 104,\n\u2003\u2003Item5: 4\u00d769 = 276,\n\u2003\u2003Sum = 46 + 124 + 104 + 276 = 550,\n\u2003which is well above my outside offer of 196.\n8.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 3, 3, 1, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    65 x 1 + 72 x 3 + 56 x 3 + 62 x 1 + 80 x 4\n    which is 831 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 832. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 3, 3, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 3, 3, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "After careful analysis of the game\u2019s structure, here is my reasoning.\n\nWe have a \u201cpie\u201d of 5 item types with total \u201ctrue\u2010value\u201d (for me) of 449, but my private value (which assigns different \u201cexchange rates\u201d across items) makes most of the pie come from items 1, 2 and 4. My private values are:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 1 (3 units): 56 each\u2003\u2192\u2003168 total  \n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 2 (3 units): 36 each\u2003\u2192\u2003108 total  \n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 3 (5 units): 18 each\u2003\u2192\u200390 total  \n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 4 (1 unit): 31\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2192\u200331 total  \n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 5 (4 units): 13 each\u2003\u2192\u200352 total  \nThus if I received everything, I\u2019d get 449. My outside offer (my \u201cdisagreement point\u201d) is 356, so any deal that nets me less than that is unattractive.\n\nOn the other hand, Player 2\u2019s unknown private per\u2010unit values come from a uniform [1,101] distribution (so an expected value of about 51 per unit). In expectation, his \u201cfull\u2010pie\u201d value would be roughly \n\u2003\u2003Item1: 3\u00d751 =153,  \n\u2003\u2003Item2: 3\u00d751 =153,  \n\u2003\u2003Item3: 5\u00d751 =255,  \n\u2003\u2003Item4: 1\u00d751 =51,  \n\u2003\u2003Item5: 4\u00d751 =204,  \nsumming to \u2248816. His outside offer is uniformly drawn from [1, 816] so its expected value is near 408. \n\nIn any negotiation round a deal must give each party at least his disagreement payoff. Because I have a \u201cgood\u201d fallback (356 is quite high relative to my 449) I cannot afford to \u201cgive away\u201d too many of the items that I value most. Yet to get Player 2 to accept a proposal he must receive (roughly speaking) at least his fallback value (about 408 in expected terms). In this problem the natural \u201coptimal\u201d divisions (for example, keeping all of my best items and giving away low\u2010value ones) lead to a split where I would get, in the best allocation that \u201cprotects\u201d my payoff, about 325\u2013361 in my own value. Even if I try to improve my share by \u201cstealing\u201d one unit from the lower\u2013value items (like taking a unit of item 3 rather than giving it to Player 2) my best outcomes end up with me around 361; but then Player 2\u2019s allocated items come out to only about 6 units in \u201cexpected\u201d terms (e.g. all of item 5 plus a couple of units of item 3), whose expected value from his perspective is only about 6\u00d751 = 306 \u2013 well below his likely outside offer of around 408. \n\nThus, any division that would give me more than my disagreement payoff (356) would force me to \u201csteal\u201d too many items and cause Player 2\u2019s package (when measured in his expected per\u2013unit values) to fall below his fallback. In a rational equilibrium both sides would need to get at least as much as their outside option. In this case there is no division of the 16 units that makes me get 356 or more while giving Player 2 what (in expectation) is roughly his fallback value. (A \u201cfair\u201d division in terms of the raw numbers would require giving Player 2 about 8 units at the average of 51 each \u2013 i.e. an expected 408 \u2013 and leaving me 8 best\u2013choice units, which at best gives me around 325 \u2013 far less than my 356.)\n\nEven after contemplating alternatives (for instance, sometimes one might sacrifice highly\u2013valued items to \u201cmeet\u201d the other\u2019s reservation, but given my steep \u201creservation ratio\u201d I end up losing much more value than I can afford), it appears I cannot propose any counteroffer in Round 1 that leaves me with more than or equal to my outside offer while also clearing Player 2\u2019s acceptance hurdle (given his outside offer is likely higher on his scale). \n\nSince by choosing any initial counteroffer I risk a no\u2013deal (in which case I would get my outside offer of 356) and there is no counteroffer that would both \u201cimprove\u201d on my fallback and be acceptable to Player 2 in equilibrium, my best action is to secure my fallback immediately. \n\nTherefore, in Round 1 I will WALK away from the negotiations.\n\nMy action is:\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 0, 0, 7] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    3 x 0 + 26 x 3 + 2 x 0 + 13 x 0 + 73 x 7\n    which is 589 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 590. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Your outside offer is 128, which is considerably lower than \u2248200. This means that accepting the current offer guarantees you a high payoff relative to walking away.\n\n[Step 4] Consider the possibility of counteroffering. While you might be tempted to try to gain more\u2014for example, by appealing for some of item\u202f5, which you value highly\u2014this could prompt further rounds.

The current sure discounted value is very attractive.\n\n[Step 5] Given that the secured value by accepting (\u2248200) is high compared to your outside option (128) and that further counteroffers risk delay and possible loss, the rational action is to ACCEPT the current offer.\n\nThus, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

                    "response": "I'll explain my reasoning before giving my proposal.\n\nStep 1 \u2013 Background and My Reservation:\n\u2022 There are 1206 total points for me (by my private values on the items) if I got everything.\n\u2022 My private outside option is 887, so any deal I accept must be worth at least 887 to me (no discount in round 1). Therefore, the items I keep in the deal must sum to a value (according to my values) of at least 887.\n\nStep 2 \u2013 Which Items Are Most Valuable to Me?\nMy private per\u2010unit values are:\n\u2003 \u2022 Item1: 65\u2003 (6 units available \u2192 6\u00d765 = 390)\n\u2003 \u2022 Item2: 32\u2003 (9 units available \u2192 9\u00d732 = 288)\n\u2003 \u2022 Item3: 51\u2003 (3 units available \u2192 3\u00d751 = 153)\n\u2003 \u2022 Item4: 60\u2003 (4 units available \u2192 4\u00d760 = 240)\n\u2003 \u2022 Item5: 45\u2003 (3 units available \u2192 3\u00d745 = 135)\nI observe that Item1, Item3, Item4, and Item5 have higher values per unit than Item2. In fact, Item2 is my lowest\u2010valued item.\n\nStep 3 \u2013 Constructing a Proposal:\nSince I want to guarantee that I do at least as well as my outside option, I need to keep items that give me a total \u2265887. One natural idea is to propose that I keep the items with highest value per unit and offer Player 2 the item I value the least.\n\u2022 If I keep Item1 (390), Item3 (153), Item4 (240) and Item5 (135), my total becomes 390+153+240+135 = 918. This exceeds my reserve of 887.\n\u2022 I then give away Item2 in full (9 units) to Player 2. That is my \u201cprice\u201d for closing the deal quickly.\nWhile I don\u2019t know Player 2\u2019s individual values, offering a full allocation of my least\u2010valuable item provides a reasonably \u201cgenerous\u201d package if their private value for item2 happens to be above their fallback. (Given that their private values are uniformly distributed between 1 and 101, they might get a decent value on item2 if their realization is on the higher side.)\n\nStep 4 \u2013 Formulating the Action:\nSince I am the first mover in round 1 and must propose a list representing my initial offer (i.e. what I give to Player 2), I propose offering them:\n\u2003 \u2022 0 units of Item1,\n\u2003 \u2022 9 units of Item2,\n\u2003 \u2022 0 units of Item3,\n\u2003 \u2022 0 units of Item4,\n\u2003 \u2022 0 units of Item5.\nThis constitutes a valid offer. I would then obtain the remainder:\n\u2003 \u2022 Item1: 6 units, Item3: 3 units, Item4: 4 units, and Item5: 3 units. \nThat gives me a total value of 918 (computed as above), which is above my outside offer of 887, while providing Player 2 with the whole batch of the lowest\u2010valued item from my perspective.\n\nBased on this reasoning my action in round 1 is to make the following initial offer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 9, 0, 0, 0]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 75. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 960 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    59 x 1 + 55 x 0 + 25 x 0 + 82 x 0 + 99 x 0\n    which is 59 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 75. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 9, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 9, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

By delaying acceptance, the future value will be less favorable due to this factor.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer:** [0, 9, 0, 0, 0].

My per\u2010unit values are highest on items 2 (65), 4 (74) and 5 (68) and lower on items 1 and 3 (both 40). It is efficient for me to \u201ckeep\u201d most of the high\u2010value items and \u201cconcede\u201d those on which my valuation is relatively lower.\n3. A natural idea is to concede all of items 1 and 3 (totaling 5 and 4 units, respectively) to Player\u00a02 because my value on them (40 per unit) is low. In contrast, Player\u00a02\u2019s private values (drawn uniformly so that the expected value is roughly 51 per unit) are likely to be higher than mine on these items.\n4. However, if I only give away items 1 and 3, Player\u00a02 would get about 5\u00d751 + 4\u00d751 \u2248 459 in expected value \u2013 which might be too low compared to the probable size of their outside offer. To help \u201cbuy\u201d an early agreement, I need to add additional concessions from one of the items that I value less (ideally the item with the next\u2013lowest value, item\u00a02 at 65).\n5. Therefore, I propose to also give up most of item\u00a02 \u2013 leaving me only 1 unit of item\u00a02 (since there are 6 total). In my offer, Player\u00a02 receives 5 units of item\u00a02. With this extra concession the approximate expected value for Player\u00a02 becomes: \n\u2003\u2003Item\u00a01: 5\u00d751 = 255;\n\u2003\u2003Item\u00a02: 5\u00d751 = 255;\n\u2003\u2003Item\u00a03: 4\u00d751 = 204;\n\u2003\u2003Total \u2248 714.\nThis should compare well with Player\u00a02\u2019s uncertain outside offer and gives them an incentive to agree early.\n6. Meanwhile my remaining items (1 unit of item\u00a02; all 6 units each of items 4 and 5) yield me:\n\u2003\u2003Item\u00a02: 1\u00d765 = 65;\n\u2003\u2003Item\u00a04: 6\u00d774 = 444;\n\u2003\u2003Item\u00a05: 6\u00d768 = 408;\n\u2003\u2003Total = 917.\nThis far exceeds my reservation value and is satisfactory from my perspective.\n7. The proposed counteroffer is therefore to offer Player\u00a02 the following allocation: \n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 5 units, Item 2: 5 units, Item 3: 4 units, Item 4: 0 units, and Item 5: 0 units.\n\nThus, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [5, 5, 4, 0, 0]}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 6, 4, 6, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    17 x 1 + 100 x 6 + 17 x 4 + 90 x 6 + 19 x 0\n    which is 1225 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1226. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [5, 5, 4, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [5, 5, 4, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "My reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. I first computed my total value if I collected every available unit. With my private per\u2010unit values for items 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, the full bundle value is:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 1\u00d761 = 61  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 0 (since none are available)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 2\u00d777 = 154  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 2\u00d713 = 26  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 4\u00d79 = 36  \n\u2003\u2003Total = 61 + 154 + 26 + 36 = 277.\n\n2. I also note that my outside offer is 223. Therefore if we have no deal, I get 223. In order to prefer an agreement in Round 1 (with no discount) over my outside option, my share in any proposed deal should yield a value higher than (or at least equal to) 223.\n\n3. In choosing a division, I want to maximize my own value as far above 223 as possible while still giving Player 2 enough to be induced to accept rather than relying on their (uncertain) outside offer. I also know that my value per unit is very different from what I believe to be the expected range for Player 2 (whose values are drawn uniformly between 1 and 101). Statistically, the expected per\u2010unit value for Player 2 is around 51. Thus, when allocating the scarce quantities that I highly value (e.g. item 1 and item 3), I want to keep those for myself, while offering Player 2 a share of items that I value relatively little (items 4 and 5) so that even if their values are higher than mine, they will receive a reasonably attractive bundle.\n\n4. In fact, note that if I keep item 1 (worth 61 to me) and item 3 (worth 2\u00d777 = 154 to me), I obtain 215 in value, which by itself is below my outside option of 223. So to clear that gap I must also keep at least one unit from item 4 (worth 13 to me) or some amount of item 5 (worth 9 each). In order to give Player 2 an appealing offer we want to gift them a bundle that, based on expected values, is competitive with their outside offer. Rather than split items I place none of the high\u2010value items (for me) into Player 2\u2019s share. Instead, I propose giving Player 2 the entire supply of item 5 (4 units) and one unit of item 4 (which I value less than item 1 or item 3). That would leave me with one unit from item 4, along with item 1 and item 3 in full. My own value would then be:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 1\u00d761 = 61  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 2\u00d777 = 154  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 1\u00d713 = 13  \n\u2003\u2003Total = 61 + 154 + 13 = 228,  \nwhich is above my outside offer of 223.\n\n5. For Player 2, this proposal offers them 1 unit of item 4 and all 4 units of item 5. Based on their expected per\u2010unit value (around 51 on average), they might see roughly 1\u00d751 + 4\u00d751 \u2248 255 in expected value \u2013 which is comfortably above a typical outside offer for them.\n\n6. Balancing these considerations, as Player 1 my initial counteroffer is to propose giving Player 2 the following amounts (in the order of items 1 through 5):  \n\u2003\u2003Item1: 0  \n\u2003\u2003Item2: 0  \n\u2003\u2003Item3: 0  \n\u2003\u2003Item4: 1  \n\u2003\u2003Item5: 4\n\nThus, I will propose this offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 1, 4]}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 2, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    41 x 0 + 63 x 0 + 9 x 2 + 48 x 0 + 86 x 0\n    which is 18 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 26. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 1, 4]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",

That means the \u201ccost\u201d in our own values that we give up (by allocating items to Player 2) cannot exceed 1150 \u2013 1128 = 22.\n\nLooking at our per\u2013unit values, even our \u201ccheapest\u201d item is item 5 (valued at only 10 per unit to us). Conceding one unit of item 5 costs us 10 value points and two units cost 20. (All other items cost us at least 42 per unit.) Thus the only offers that would leave us receiving at least 1128 in our own value would be to give Player 2 either nothing, 1, or 2 units of item 5 and nothing else.\n\nHowever, Player 2\u2019s private values are drawn uniformly from 1 to 101 so (by a rough \u201caverage\u2010value\u201d calculation) they might expect about 51 per unit on average. That implies an allocation of 1 or 2 units of item 5 (worth roughly 51 or 102 expected value to them) is extremely unlikely to beat the outside offer they would have drawn (their own reservation is drawn uniformly from 1 up to their full potential value \u2013 on average roughly half of what getting everything would be). In short, any offer that keeps our own value near our outside offer (by conceding at most 22 points) gives Player 2 far too little. \n\nSince if we make an offer, we cannot afford to make it attractive enough for Player 2 to accept without lowering our own payoff below 1128, it would be very risky to counteroffer. Moreover, once the negotiation proceeds to later rounds the discount factor (\u03b3 = 0.98) will diminish the values further. In round 1 a sure payoff of 1128 via our outside option is nearly as good as getting everything, and it avoids uncertainty. \n\nThus, given that any counteroffer we could make that would entice Player 2 would force us to sacrifice more than we can afford (dropping below our own reservation), our optimal and safest action in Round 1 is to WALK away.\n\nFinal answer in the required format:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 4, 2, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    10 x 0 + 35 x 0 + 69 x 4 + 13 x 2 + 61 x 4\n    which is 546 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 547. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 2, 2, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 2, 2, 2, 4]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n1. **Outside Offer Value:**\n   - Your outside offer value is 547.\n\n2. **Values of the Items:**\n   - Item 1: 10 per unit\n   - Item 2: 35 per unit\n   - Item 3: 69 per unit\n   - Item 4: 13 per unit\n   - Item 5: 61 per unit\n\n3. **Total Pool of Items:**\n   - Item 1: 5 units\n   - Item 2: 5 units\n   - Item 3: 4 units\n   - Item 4: 4 units\n   - Item 5: 7 units\n\n4. **Discount Factor:**\n   - The discount factor gamma is 0.98. The value of the outcome is multiplied by gamma to the power of (r-1), which is (1-1) = 0 in round 1, so it does not affect values in the first round.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n1. **Current Offer Value:**\n   - Units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 10 = 20\n   - Units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 35 = 70\n   - Units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 69 = 138\n   - Units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 13 = 26\n   - Units of item 5: 4 \u00d7 61 = 244\n   - Total value if you accept: 20 + 70 + 138 + 26 + 244 = 498\n\n2. **Comparison to Outside Offer:**\n   - The current offer yields 498, which is less than your outside offer of 547.\n\n3. **Potential Counteroffers:**\n   - I need to propose a counteroffer that yields a value greater than 547. Let's propose a counteroffer that maximizes value of high value items.\n   - One approach is to ensure a larger share of high-value items like item 3 and item 5.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nBased on current analysis, we need to propose a counteroffer. To keep it advantageous, let's consider the following distribution:\n\n- Keep more units of items with higher values to surpass the outside offer. Consider keeping [1, 2, 4, 0, 5] and offer [4, 3, 0, 4, 2] to Player 1:\n\n1. **Value of the Proposed Offer:**\n   - Units of item 1: 1 \u00d7 10 = 10\n   - Units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 35 = 70\n   - Units of item 3: 4 \u00d7 69 = 276\n   - Units of item 4: 0 \u00d7 13 = 0\n   - Units of item 5: 5 \u00d7 61 = 305\n   - Total value: 10 + 70 + 276 + 0 + 305 = 661\n\nThis proposal satisfies the condition that the value is greater than my outside offer of 547.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the current offer on the table is less than my outside offer, and my calculated counteroffer is more than the outside offer, I would like to propose a counteroffer that offers player 1: [4, 3, 0, 4, 2].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 3, 0, 4, 2]}\n```",

                    "response": "I will explain my thought\u2010process briefly. My goal is to secure a deal that is at least as good as my outside offer of 662 (remember that in round\u202f1 there is no discount, so I get 662 for \u201cno\u2010deal\u201d). In any complete deal the items are split between us. I value all the items in total at 730, so if I kept everything I\u2019d have 730\u2014but player 2 would get nothing and (almost surely) would then prefer his outside offer. (Player 2\u2019s private values are unknown, but their \u201ctotal\u201d (if they got all items) would be on the order of 1071; then his privately drawn outside offer is uniformly drawn between 1 and his total so its expected value is roughly half\u2014around 536.)\n\nTo have player 2 accept any deal I propose, I must assign him a package that (in his eyes) is at least as good as his outside offer. If I assume that (on average) each unit of any item is worth about 51 to him then giving him at least 11 units (since 11\u00d751 \u2248 561, which clears a reservation of about 536) would be needed. But note the following: I have private values for each item that strongly favor some items over others. For example, I get most value from item 1 (52 per unit) and especially item 4 (72 per unit) whereas my value for item 2 is very low (3 per unit) and for item 3 moderate (26 per unit). Ideally, I would \u201cpay\u201d for making player 2 whole by transferring only items that are cheap to me yet valuable to him. Unfortunately, the only items with \u201clow cost\u201d for me are items 2 and (to a lesser extent) item 3. But if I give away all of item 2 (4 units) and even all of item 3 (7 units) to reach the minimum of 11 units for player 2, then on my side I would keep only items 1, 4, and 5. My own valuation of that remainder is:\n\u2003 item 1: 6 \u00d7 52 = 312  \n\u2003 item 4: 2 \u00d7 72 = 144  \n\u2003 item 5: 2 \u00d7 40 = 80  \n\u2003Total = 312 + 144 + 80 = 536  \nThis is far below my outside offer (662). In fact, since my \u201closs\u201d from giving even the most \u201cefficient\u201d bundle (the 11 cheapest units in terms of my private cost) subtracts about 194 from my total 730, there is no allocation that both (a) gives player 2 roughly 11 units (or their reservation value) and (b) leaves me at least 662 in value.\n\nSince any division that might satisfy player 2\u2019s acceptance (by giving him enough \u201cunits\u201d) would leave me with significantly less than my sure alternative of 662, my best move is not to try to divide the items at all.\n\nThus, my chosen action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

                    "response": "Step\u2010by\u2010step reasoning:\n1. In this negotiation I (Player\u00a01) know my own per\u2010unit values: item\u00a01=90, item\u00a02=69, item\u00a03=45, item\u00a04=57, item\u00a05=44. I also know the available quantities: 2, 2, 5, 7, and 4 respectively. My total full\u2010bundle value is 1118, and my outside option is 560.\n2. With an immediate (round 1) offer there is no discount (\u03b3^(0)=1). I want any deal to give me a value above 560.\n3. Since my opponent\u2019s private values are drawn uniformly from 1 to 101, his average per\u2010unit value is roughly 51. Thus, for each item I can compare how much advantage I have. For item 1 and item 2 my advantage is strong (90 vs. ~51 and 69 vs. ~51) so I want to claim these entirely. For items 3 and 5 my value (45 and 44) is less than his average (\u224851), so I lean toward giving those items to him. Item 4 is borderline (57 vs. ~51) so I might share it.\n4. A plausible division is to propose that I take all of items 1 and 2 (since I gain comparatively more), to let him have all of items 3 and 5 (which he likely values more), and to split item 4 so that my own share still leaves me with a deal value higher than my outside option.\n5. For instance, if I give him 0 of item 1 and 0 of item 2, all 5 units of item 3, and all 4 units of item 5, I need to decide on how many units of item 4 to give him. If I give him 2 units, then I keep 7 \u2212 2 = 5 units of item 4.\n6. My payoff then is:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 2\u00d790 = 180\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 2\u00d769 = 138 \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 5\u00d757 = 285 \n\u2003\u2003Total = 180+138+285 = 603, which exceeds my outside offer of 560.\n7. Meanwhile, the opponent\u2019s allocation would be:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 5 units (expected value \u2248 5\u00d751 = 255)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 2 units (\u22482\u00d751 = 102)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 4 units (\u22484\u00d751 = 204)\n\u2003\u2003Expected total \u2248 255+102+204 = 561,\nwhich should be competitive with his outside option.\n8.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 934. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1017 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 3, 6, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    80 x 0 + 57 x 2 + 79 x 3 + 71 x 6 + 52 x 3\n    which is 933 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 934. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 5, 2, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 5, 2, 4]\n\n    What is your action?

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 2, 3, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    58 x 0 + 100 x 0 + 11 x 2 + 52 x 3 + 35 x 3\n    which is 283 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 284. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 4, 0, 3, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 4, 0, 3, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",

My total value (if I got everything) is 547, but my outside option is 509. That means in order to be better off than walking away I must keep at least 509 worth of my own \u201cvalue.\u201d In other words, the \u201cconcession room\u201d I have is at most 547 \u2013 509 = 38 in my terms. (Keep in mind that my per\u2010unit values are private; for me they are: item1 = 73, item2 = 65, item3 = 34, item4 = 13, and item5 = 11. One \u201cunit\u201d of concession in item1 \u201ccosts\u201d me 73 so I would not risk giving any away; similarly, item2 is too \u201cexpensive\u201d to concede \u2013 even one unit is 65.)  \n\nI must \u201cbuy\u201d Player\u00a02\u2019s acceptance with a little extra relative to what might be obtainable later, but I cannot give away too much. In my available items the \u201ccheapest\u201d to sacrifice are the item5 units (worth only 11 each for me) and\u2014if necessary\u2014maybe a single unit of item3 (worth 34). To exactly split the surplus of 38 between us (if we imagine a fair division of the \u201cextra\u201d value above my outside option) I\u2019d want to give Player\u00a02 about 19 (in my own units) while keeping 19 extra above 509 for myself. I cannot give 19 exactly using the numbers 11 or 34, so I look for a close combination.  \n\nOne plausible offer is to concede 2 units of item5. In that case I would be \u201cgiving up\u201d 2 \u00b7 11 = 22 in my own value. With that concession I would keep:\n\u2003\u2022 both units of item1 (2 \u00b7 73 = 146),\n\u2003\u2022 both units of item2 (2 \u00b7 65 = 130),\n\u2003\u2022 all 7 units of item3 (7 \u00b7 34 = 238),\n\u2003\u2022 none of item4 (0 \u00b7 13 = 0), and\n\u2003\u2022 1 unit of item5 (1 \u00b7 11 = 11).  \n\nThat adds up to 146 + 130 + 238 + 11 = 525 for me, which is comfortably above my outside offer of 509 (even after discounting, since we are in round 1 with no discount). Meanwhile, by receiving 2 units of item5, Player\u00a02 obtains 2 \u00b7 (their unknown per\u2010unit value for item5). Given that their per\u2010unit values are drawn uniformly from 1 to 101 (with an expected mid\u2010value around 51), 2 units may present an attractive enough immediate alternative to waiting for further rounds.  \n\nThus, as Player 1 in round 1 I will counter with the offer that gives Player 2 exactly 2 units of item5 (and keeps me the remainder). This is a valid offer (none of the numbers exceed the available totals) and is expressed as an offer of what I give to Player 2.\n\nThus, I choose to make the following counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 2]}",

The available quantities are\n\u2003\u2022 item1: 2 \n\u2003\u2022 item2: 2 \n\u2003\u2022 item3: 7 \n\u2003\u2022 item4: 0 \n\u2003\u2022 item5: 3\n\nMy private per\u2010unit values are:\n\u2003\u2022 item1 = 73 \n\u2003\u2022 item2 = 65 \n\u2003\u2022 item3 = 34 \n\u2003\u2022 item4 = 13 \n\u2003\u2022 item5 = 11\n\nSo if I ended up getting every unit, my \u201craw\u201d total value would be \n\u200373\u00d72 + 65\u00d72 + 34\u00d77 + 13\u00d70 + 11\u00d73 = 146 + 130 + 238 + 0 + 33 = 547.\n\nIn addition, I have an outside option worth 509 (which is \u201cfree\u201d if no deal is reached). This means that if we settle in round 2 the value is multiplied by the discount factor \u03b3^(2\u20131) = 0.98; so my deal must yield me a raw (undiscounted) value V so that 0.98\u00d7V is at least as good as 509. In other words, I need\n\u2003\u2003V \u2265 509/0.98 \u2248 519.4.\nThus, any deal from the negotiation in round 2 should give me roughly 520 or more in my own \u201craw\u201d units in order to beat my outside option.\n\nNow, let\u2019s evaluate the current offer on the table. Player 2 has offered me\n\u2003[1, 2, 6, 0, 0].\nThat means if I were to accept it I would get:\n\u2003item1: 1 unit, item2: 2 units, item3: 6 units, item4: 0, item5: 0.\nCalculating my raw value:\n\u20031\u00d773 + 2\u00d765 + 6\u00d734 = 73 + 130 + 204 = 407.\nThen its present (discounted) value is 0.98\u00d7407 \u2248 398.9,\nwhich is well below the guaranteed 509 outside option. So accepting is not attractive.\n\nI must \u201cmake a counteroffer\u201d that, if accepted immediately in round 2, would give me a raw value near or above roughly 520 while giving the opponent something \u2013 just enough that they (with their own uncertain private values and outside offer) might be willing to settle now rather than risk waiting another round and the extra delay discounting.\n\nBecause I value almost every unit very highly (especially items 1 and 2) and item 3 is moderately valued while item 5 is relatively \u201ccheap\u201d for me, I want to keep nearly everything. A minimal concession (i.e. a gift of one unit of the low\u2010value item5) will cost me only 11 raw points. Conceding 1 unit of item5 means I keep:\n\u2003\u2022 item1: 2 units\n\u2003\u2022 item2: 2 units\n\u2003\u2022 item3: 7 units\n\u2003\u2022 item5: (3 \u2013 1) = 2 units.\nThus my raw value becomes:\n\u20032\u00d773 + 2\u00d765 + 7\u00d734 + 2\u00d711 = 146 + 130 + 238 + 22 = 536.\nDiscounted value then is 0.98\u00d7536 \u2248 525.3, which exceeds my outside option.\nAlthough I do not know Player 2\u2019s exact values, giving them one unit of item5 (which is only 11 to me) is a minimal but nonzero concession \u2013 and if they value that item more than I do, it may be attractive enough for them to accept.\n\nThus, I decide not to accept the current offer (which gives me only 407 raw) and instead propose the counteroffer that gives Player 2 one unit of item5 (and nothing else), leaving me nearly the entire bundle.\n\nMy answer is therefore:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 286. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1020 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 2, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    73 x 0 + 48 x 1 + 98 x 2 + 82 x 0 + 39 x 1\n    which is 283 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 286. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 2, 6, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

They receive the offer vector; we keep what\u2019s left.\n\u2022 Our raw utility for ourselves is:\n\u2003\u2003547 \u2013 [73\u00d7(concession in item1) + 65\u00d7(concession in item2) + 34\u00d7(concession in item3) + 11\u00d7(concession in item5)].\n\u2003\u2003(Item 4 is moot since there are 0 units.)\n\u2022 To ensure our raw utility is at least 530, we require:\n\u2003\u200373a + 65b + 34c + 11e \u2264 17\n\u2003\u2003where a, b, c, e are the numbers of units of items 1, 2, 3, and 5 we concede (offer to P2).\n\u2022 Since the coefficients for items 1, 2, or 3 (73, 65, 34) are too high, even giving up one unit of any of these would exceed the allowed 17. Only item 5 (coefficient 11) is \u201ccheap\u201d.\n\u2022 For item 5, giving 1 unit costs 11. We can\u2019t give 2 because 11\u00d72 = 22 > 17.\n\u2022 So the only feasible concession is to give either 0 or 1 unit of item 5 (and 0 in all other items).\n  \u2013 If we give 0 units, our raw payoff is 547. However, that gives Player 2 nothing\u2014a step back from their previous stance (they previously offered us [1,2,6,0,0] which implies they would keep some items for themselves) and is unlikely to be acceptable.\n  \u2013 If we give 1 unit of item 5, our concession is 11, making our raw payoff 547 \u2013 11 = 536, which is above our threshold 530. Discounted payoff becomes 536\u00d70.9604 \u2248 514.7, which beats our outside offer of 509.\n\nStep 4: Conclusion & Action Choice\n\u2022 Our counteroffer thus is to offer Player 2 the following allocation: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]. In return, we would get items:\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 2 \u2013 0 = 2,\n\u2003\u2003Item 2: 2 \u2013 0 = 2,\n\u2003\u2003Item 3: 7 \u2013 0 = 7,\n\u2003\u2003Item 4: 0,\n\u2003\u2003Item 5: 3 \u2013 1 = 2.\n\u2022 This gives us a raw utility of 73\u00d72 + 65\u00d72 + 34\u00d77 + 11\u00d72 = 146 + 130 + 238 + 22 = 536, and discounted \u2248514.7.\n\u2022 Although this is a small concession to Player 2, it is our only move that ensures our own payoff beats our outside option while offering something (at least in item 5) relative to their earlier proposals.\n\nThus, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]}",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 2, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    73 x 0 + 48 x 1 + 98 x 2 + 82 x 0 + 39 x 1\n    which is 283 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 286. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 2, 6, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [1, 2, 6, 0, 0]\nRound 3: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "To make a decision, let's analyze the current situation following the provided step-by-step approach:\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 286.\n   - My values for the items are:\n     - Item 1: 73\n     - Item 2: 48\n     - Item 3: 98\n     - Item 4: 82\n     - Item 5: 39\n   - The total pool of items is: 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor \u03b3 = 0.98 influences the value of accepting the current offer by reducing the value of future offers based on the number of rounds. In round 3, the discount factor does not apply because if we make a counteroffer, it is treated as a WALK.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]:\n     - Value = 0 * 73 + 0 * 48 + 0 * 98 + 0 * 82 + 1 * 39 = 39.\n   - Compare this to my outside offer value: 39 < 286.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - The current offer of [0, 0, 0, 0, 1] results in a value (39) that is less than my outside offer value (286).\n   - I should neither accept this offer nor make another counteroffer since a counteroffer at this stage is treated as a WALK.\n   - Based on the above analysis, it's best to WALK to ensure a value of 286.\n\nThus, my action is to choose to WALK away from the negotiation to secure my outside offer value of 286.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",
