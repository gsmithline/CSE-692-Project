Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 680. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 680. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 795 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 3, 3, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    78 x 1 + 27 x 1 + 2 x 3 + 77 x 3 + 81 x 4\n    which is 666 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 680. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Hence, acting sooner with an advantageous offer is better.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n   - There is currently no offer from Player 2 to evaluate.\n   - I need to propose an initial offer where the value to me is greater than 680. I can compute several potential divisions to ensure I do not make an offer worse for me than my outside offer (Mistake 2).\n\n   Consider a potential offer to Player 2, aiming to retain substantial value:\n   - Offer: [0, 1, 3, 1, 0] (meaning I keep all of item 1, 2 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 3 of item 4, 4 of item 5)\n   \n   Let's compute the value of what I would keep:\n   - Keeping:\n     - Item 1: 1 x 78 = 78\n     - Item 2: 2 x 27 = 54\n     - Item 3: 0 x 2 = 0\n     - Item 4: 3 x 77 = 231\n     - Item 5: 4 x 81 = 324\n\n   - Total value to me = 78 + 54 + 0 + 231 + 324 = 687\n\n3) **Make a Decision:**\n   - Given that my proposed offer yields a value of 687, which is greater than my outside offer of 680, it is advantageous to propose this as my initial offer.\n   - Further, since this is round 1, the discount hasn't yet devalued potential future offers, hence I can afford to negotiate with this strategic counteroffer.\n\nTherefore, to ensure I'm optimizing my outcome in the negotiation:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 3, 1, 0]}\n```",

Let's consider some allocations:\n\n     For example, if I keep: \n     - [1, 0, 3, 3, 4], then:\n       - Item 1: 1 unit \u00d7 78 = 78\n       - Item 2: 0 units \u00d7 27 = 0\n       - Item 3: 3 units \u00d7 2 = 6\n       - Item 4: 3 units \u00d7 77 = 231\n       - Item 5: 4 units \u00d7 81 = 324\n       - Total value = 78 + 0 + 6 + 231 + 324 = 639\n       - If Player 2's offer: [0, 3, 0, 1, 0] is accepted, my value becomes higher than 680 = 639 \u00d7 0.98 = 626.22\n\nSince the value of item 5 is highest for me, ideally, in our negotiation, we can show our willingness to keep other items minimal leaving items 5,4,2 in enough numbers to make upto at outside offer value.\n\n3. **Make a decision:**\n   - I should propose a counteroffer that keeps the value I get above my outside offer of 680.\n\nSince everything being proposed or kept doesn't seem as significant as maximizing item 4, and given no realistic current allocation above for accepting, my current offer: [0, 2, 0, 3, 0] doesn't give more than the outside offer value. Therefore, I need to provide a different counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 0, 1, 1]}\n```\n\nThis offer means I'll keep less of item 2 but retain 3 units each of Item 4 and Item 5, which maintains a significant share of items with my preferences and does not go below my outside offer while still attempting to ensure a negotiation.",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 662. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 930 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 2, 2, 4, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    55 x 1 + 26 x 2 + 92 x 2 + 48 x 4 + 89 x 2\n    which is 661 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 662. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 3, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 2, 0, 3, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 3, 0, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 3, 0, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action for Player 2.\n\n1. **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value: 662\n   - My item values: item 1: 55, item 2: 26, item 3: 92, item 4: 48, item 5: 89\n   - Total items: item 1: 1, item 2: 3, item 3: 3, item 4: 4, item 5: 4\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.98. This means accepting an offer now is worth slightly more than accepting the same offer next round.\n\n2. **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [0, 3, 0, 1, 1]. This means I get:\n      - 0 units of item 1\n      - 3 units of item 2\n      - 0 units of item 3\n      - 1 units of item 4\n      - 1 units of item 5\n      My value for this offer is: (0 * 55) + (3 * 26) + (0 * 92) + (1 * 48) + (1 * 89) = 0 + 78 + 0 + 48 + 89 = 215.\n\n      Since 215 < 662 (my outside offer), accepting this offer would be a mistake.\n\n   - **Consider my previous offer:** I offered Player 1 [0, 2, 0, 3, 0]. This means I would have kept:\n      - 1 unit of item 1\n      - 1 unit of item 2\n      - 3 units of item 3\n      - 1 unit of item 4\n      - 4 units of item 5\n      My value for my previous offer is: (1 * 55) + (1 * 26) + (3 * 92) + (1 * 48) + (4 * 89) = 55 + 26 + 276 + 48 + 356 = 761\n\n      Since 761 > 662, my previous offer would have been better for me than my outside offer.\n\n   - **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to find an offer that gives me a value greater than 662. Let's start by trying to keep more of the valuable items, item 3 and item 5.\n\n      Let's consider keeping all of item 3 (3 units) and all of item 5 (4 units) and 1 unit of item 1, and then giving equal units of the rest.\n      I keep [1, 1, 3, 2, 4]. I offer [0, 2, 0, 2, 0]\n      My value is (1 * 55) + (1 * 26) + (3 * 92) + (2 * 48) + (4 * 89) = 55 + 26 + 276 + 96 + 356 = 809. This is greater than 662. Let's make that offer\n\n3. **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   - Accepting the current offer is not beneficial (215 < 662).\n   - Walking away is an option, but I can potentially get a better deal.\n   - Proposing a counteroffer seems like the best strategy. I will offer [0, 2, 0, 2, 0] to Player 1.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 0, 2, 0]}\n```",

Since this is the final round, there is no future offer to wait for, and the decision must be made on the current situation.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n1. **Current Offer Value:**  \n   - The current offer is [0, 2, 0, 2, 0].\n   - My value if I accept this offer:\n     - Item 1: 1 unit (keeping) \\(\\times 78 = 78\\)\n     - Item 2: 1 unit (keeping) \\(\\times 27 = 27\\)\n     - Item 3: 3 units (keeping) \\(\\times 2 = 6\\)\n     - Item 4: 2 units (keeping) \\(\\times 77 = 154\\)\n     - Item 5: 4 units (keeping) \\(\\times 81 = 324\\)\n   - Total value for me = \\(78 + 27 + 6 + 154 + 324 = 589\\)\n\n2. **Compare Values:**  \n   - The value of accepting the current offer is 589.\n   - This is less than my outside offer of 680.\n\n### Step 3: Decision Making\n\n1. **Should I accept the current offer?**  \n   - No, because the current offer value (589) is less than my outside offer (680).\n\n2. **Should I walk away and take my outside offer?**  \n   - Yes, because walking away yields a higher value (680) than accepting the offer (589).\n\n3. **Propose a counteroffer?**  \n   - Since it's the last round and accepting the current offer is worse than the outside offer, proposing a new counteroffer doesn't make sense if it's the last player's turn.\n\nBased on this analysis, the optimal course of action is to walk away and accept the outside offer, as it provides a better guaranteed value than the current negotiation offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 638. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 732 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 2, 2, 3, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    67 x 3 + 72 x 2 + 6 x 2 + 81 x 3 + 18 x 2\n    which is 636 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 638. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Offer to Player 2: [0, 2, 1, 0, 0] (I keep [3, 2, 1, 3, 3])\n\n   My value:\n   - Item 1: 3 \u00d7 67 = 201\n   - Item 2: 2 \u00d7 72 = 144\n   - Item 3: 1 \u00d7 6 = 6\n   - Item 4: 3 \u00d7 81 = 243\n   - Item 5: 3 \u00d7 18 = 54\n\n   Total Value = 201 + 144 + 6 + 243 + 54 = 648\n\n   648 is greater than 638, my outside offer. \n\nFinally, adjusted for the discount factor (if the deal concludes in round 2):\n   - Adjusted Value = 648 \u00d7 0.98 = 635.04\n\nSince 635.04 is just under my outside offer, I can adjust the offer slightly to ensure my adjusted value is above my outside offer.\n\n2. Offer to Player 2: [0, 2, 0, 0, 0] (I keep [3, 2, 2, 3, 3])\n\n   My value:\n   - Item 1: 3 \u00d7 67 = 201\n   - Item 2: 2 \u00d7 72 = 144\n   - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 6 = 12\n   - Item 4: 3 \u00d7 81 = 243\n   - Item 5: 3 \u00d7 18 = 54\n\n   Total Value = 201 + 144 + 12 + 243 + 54 = 654\n\n   Adjusted for Discount Factor = 654 \u00d7 0.98 = 641.88\n\n   Since this value of 641.88 is greater than my outside offer of 638, this should be considered for a counteroffer.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nThe current offer's adjusted value (449.82) is worse than my outside offer (638), so I should not accept it.\n\nA potential counteroffer of [0, 2, 0, 0, 0] results in an adjusted value of 641.88, which is better than my outside offer. This makes it a suitable counteroffer.\n\nTherefore, my action will be:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 93. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1026 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    95 x 0 + 52 x 0 + 85 x 0 + 21 x 0 + 89 x 1\n    which is 89 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 93. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 2, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 3, 0, 3, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

This means I get 0 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5. My value for this offer is: (0 * 95) + (2 * 52) + (0 * 85) + (0 * 21) + (0 * 89) = 0 + 104 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 104. Since it's round 2, this value is discounted by 0.98^(2-1) = 0.98. So the discounted value is 104 * 0.98 = 101.92.\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** My outside offer is 93.

                    "response": "To determine my next action in this negotiation, I need to conduct a thorough analysis as instructed:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **My Outside Offer Value:** 1169\n- **Value of Items to Me:**\n  - Item 1: 98 per unit (5 units available)\n  - Item 2: 87 per unit (3 units available)\n  - Item 3: 28 per unit (4 units available)\n  - Item 4: 19 per unit (4 units available)\n  - Item 5: 100 per unit (4 units available)\n- **Total Pool of Items:** [5, 3, 4, 4, 4]\n  \nThe discount factor (\\( \\gamma = 0.98 \\)) influences the value by decreasing it in future rounds, as the value would be multiplied by \\(\\gamma^{r-1}\\). However, since we're in round 1, this won't affect the current calculations.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\nSince there is no current offer from Player 2 to accept or reject, I must focus on formulating a potential counteroffer. I need to aim for a division of the items that results in a value to me greater than my outside offer of 1169.\n\nLet's explore a potential division:\n- Keep more units of high-value items (especially items 1 and 5, since they have the highest value to me).\n\n**Example Counteroffer to Player 2:**\n- Offer: [0, 1, 3, 1, 2] (meaning I retain [5, 2, 1, 3, 2])\n\n**My Value Calculation:**\n- 5 units of item 1: \\(5 \\times 98 = 490\\)\n- 2 units of item 2: \\(2 \\times 87 = 174\\)\n- 1 unit of item 3: \\(1 \\times 28 = 28\\)\n- 3 units of item 4: \\(3 \\times 19 = 57\\)\n- 2 units of item 5: \\(2 \\times 100 = 200\\)\n\n- **Total Value to Me:** \\(490 + 174 + 28 + 57 + 200 = 949\\)\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\n- **Considerations:**\n  - The total value of the example offer (949) is lower than my outside offer (1169).\n  - I need to iterate to a more advantageous offer.\n\n- **Iterated Counteroffer:**\n  - Offer: [2, 1, 3, 0, 1] (meaning I retain [3, 2, 1, 4, 3])\n\n**My Value Calculation for Iterated Counteroffer:**\n- 3 units of item 1: \\(3 \\times 98 = 294\\)\n- 2 units of item 2: \\(2 \\times 87 = 174\\)\n- 1 unit of item 3: \\(1 \\times 28 = 28\\)\n- 4 units of item 4: \\(4 \\times 19 = 76\\)\n- 3 units of item 5: \\(3 \\times 100 = 300\\)\n\n- **Total Value to Me:** \\(294 + 174 + 28 + 76 + 300 = 872\\)\n\nThis revised calculation still falls below my outside offer of 1169. To meet my objective of securing a value greater than 1169, I need further adjustment, possibly offering fewer units of higher-value items.\n\n**Iterated Valid Counteroffer (aim for improvement):**\n- Offer: [4, 2, 3, 0, 2]  (meaning I retain [1, 1, 1, 4, 2])\n\n**My Value Calculation for the Finer Counteroffer:**\n- 1 unit of item 1: \\(1 \\times 98 = 98\\)\n- 1 unit of item 2: \\(1 \\times 87 = 87\\)\n- 1 unit of item 3: \\(1 \\times 28 = 28\\)\n- 4 units of item 4: \\(4 \\times 19 = 76\\)\n- 2 units of item 5: \\(2 \\times 100 = 200\\)\n\n- **Total Value to Me:** \\(98 + 87 + 28 + 76 + 200 = 489\\)\n\nThis is even further from my required threshold. I need an offer retaining more higher valued items.\n\n**Final Iteration:**\n- Offer: [2, 0, 3, 0, 1] (meaning I retain [3, 3, 1, 4, 3])\n\n**My Final Value Calculation:**\n- 3 units of item 1: \\(3 \\times 98 = 294\\)\n- 3 units of item 2: \\(3 \\times 87 = 261\\)\n- 1 unit of item 3: \\(1 \\times 28 = 28\\)\n- 4 units of item 4: \\(4 \\times 19 = 76\\)\n- 3 units of item 5: \\(3 \\times 100 = 300\\)\n\n- **Total Value to Me:** \\(294 + 261 + 28 + 76 + 300 = 959\\)\n\nGiven the difficulties in maintaining a greater value than my outside offer without sacrificing too much, I'm left without an immediate satisfying counterplan that surpasses my outside offer. Therefore, until a strategic revision allows optimal retention, relying on my outside offer may become inevitable unless further item holding is definitely realized.\n\n**Conclusion and Action:**\nDue to analysis revealing each iteration decisively lowering than my fallback, an optimal path for my position demands reconsideration for greater advantageous proposals or continuation of fallback stability.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 989. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 858 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [6, 2, 5, 2, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    20 x 6 + 13 x 2 + 86 x 5 + 92 x 2 + 75 x 3\n    which is 985 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 989. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 1118.\n   - My item values are: item 1 = 75, item 2 = 44, item 3 = 98, item 4 = 51, item 5 = 29.\n   - Total items are: 7 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 5 of item 3, 3 of item 4, 3 of item 5.\n   - The discount factor is 0.98. This means accepting an offer in a later round is slightly less valuable than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** I am being offered [0, 2, 5, 2, 1].

This is also not better than my outside offer of 1118.\n\n      Since time is running out, I should at least make sure my offer is better than walking away. I am going to offer a bit more than I was offered, trying to secure a deal now rather than risk losing out in future rounds.\n\n      Let's try offering [0, 1, 3, 1, 1]. I keep [7, 2, 2, 2, 2].\n\n      Value = (7 * 75) + (2 * 44) + (2 * 98) + (2 * 51) + (2 * 29) = 525 + 88 + 196 + 102 + 58 = 969. Still less than my outside offer.\n\n      Let's offer them [0, 0, 1, 0, 0].

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 989. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 858 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [6, 2, 5, 2, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    20 x 6 + 13 x 2 + 86 x 5 + 92 x 2 + 75 x 3\n    which is 985 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 989. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 5, 2, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Therefore, accepting the current offer is not beneficial.\n\n3) **Make a Decision:**\n\n   - **ACCEPT the current offer?** No, the current offer is worth much less than my outside offer.\n   - **WALK and take my outside offer?** If a better offer cannot be proposed, this might be a fallback.\n   - **Propose a specific COUNTEROFFER?** Yes.

I need to try another configuration.\n\nLet's try keeping [7, 1, 5, 2, 3] and offer [0, 2, 0, 1, 0] to Player 2.\n\n   - Value of the units I keep:\n     - 20 x 7 = 140\n     - 13 x 1 = 13\n     - 86 x 5 = 430\n     - 92 x 2 = 184\n     - 75 x 3 = 225\n   - Total value: 140 + 13 + 430 + 184 + 225 = 992\n\nSince 992 > 989, this offer is more beneficial than the outside offer.\n\nTherefore, my action will be:\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 0, 1, 0]}",

This means accepting an offer in a later round is slightly less valuable than accepting it now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am offered [0, 2, 0, 1, 0]. This means I receive 0 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n    *   Value of current offer: (0 * 75) + (2 * 44) + (0 * 98) + (1 * 51) + (0 * 29) = 0 + 88 + 0 + 51 + 0 = 139\n    *   This is significantly less than my outside offer of 1118.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that, if accepted, would give me a value greater than 1118.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 3, 1, 2, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party.

This influences the value of accepting a current offer versus waiting for future offers as the value is reduced by 0.98 for each additional round.  \n\n2. **Assess the Value of Offers:**  \n   - Since there is no current offer, let's evaluate potential counteroffers.  \n   - The value of different proposed divisions must be compared to my outside offer of 456.  \n   - Let\u2019s explore keeping specific combinations that maximize my value:  \n\n       Let's first calculate the total value of all items:  \n       - Total value if I keep all items:  \n         \\[\n         2 \\times 42 + 3 \\times 75 + 6 \\times 24 + 2 \\times 50 + 4 \\times 16 = 617\n         \\]  \n       - Therefore, I need to propose a counteroffer where I keep items with a total value of more than 456 to avoid Mistake 2.  \n\n3. **Make a Decision Based on the Analysis:**  \n   - Since I've verified that giving away too many high-value items will reduce my total value below my outside offer, I'll propose a split that maximizes my value while still improving upon potential future rounds due to the discount factor.  \n   \n   Let's consider keeping items amounting just above the outside offer but at least close to the immediate round value considering the discount:  \n   - Suppose I decide to keep [2, 2, 3, 1, 3], which I evaluate as below:  \n     \\[\n     2 \\times 42 + 2 \\times 75 + 3 \\times 24 + 1 \\times 50 + 3 \\times 16 = 456  \n     \\]\n   - While this exactly equals the outside offer, the value is further increased in this round by not including the 0.98 factor yet!  \n   - Verifying against alternative offers shows this is efficient unless immediately countered.  \n\nGiven my calculations and strategic rationale, I will propose a counteroffer:  \n  \n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 3, 1, 1]}\n```  \n  \nThis offer lets me keep enough value, ensuring my proposal does not fall below my outside offer while predicting the necessity for reciprocal value in response iterations.",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 456. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 621 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 3, 1, 2, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    42 x 1 + 75 x 3 + 24 x 1 + 50 x 2 + 16 x 4\n    which is 455 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 456. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 3, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To determine the best course of action in this negotiation, let's analyze the current situation step by step:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 456.\n   - My values for the items are:\n     - Item 1: 42\n     - Item 2: 75\n     - Item 3: 24\n     - Item 4: 50\n     - Item 5: 16\n   - Total pool of items:\n     - 2 units of item 1\n     - 3 units of item 2\n     - 6 units of item 3\n     - 2 units of item 4\n     - 4 units of item 5\n   - The discount factor (gamma) is 0.98, which lowers the present value of future offers. Since it's round 2, any deal concluded this round has a value multiplied by 0.98.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]:**\n     - My value if I accept:\n       - Item 4: 1 \u00d7 50 = 50\n       - Item 5: 1 \u00d7 16 = 16\n       - Total = 66\n     - With the discount factor: 66 \u00d7 0.98 = 64.68 (rounded)\n     - This is significantly less than my outside offer of 456.\n\n   - **Proposed counteroffers:**\n     - I need to propose a counteroffer where my value exceeds my outside offer of 456.\n     - Let's consider the division of items where I keep:\n       - Item 1: 2 units (2 \u00d7 42 = 84)\n       - Item 2: 2 units (2 \u00d7 75 = 150)\n       - Item 3: 2 units (2 \u00d7 24 = 48)\n       - Item 4: 1 unit (1 \u00d7 50 = 50)\n       - Item 5: 3 units (3 \u00d7 16 = 48)\n     - My total value for this offer:\n       - 84 + 150 + 48 + 50 + 48 = 380\n     - This is less than my outside offer of 456, so I'll test another allocation.\n\n     - Now, let's calculate if I keep:\n       - Item 1: 2 units (2 \u00d7 42 = 84)\n       - Item 2: 2 units (2 \u00d7 75 = 150)\n       - Item 3: 3 units (3 \u00d7 24 = 72)\n       - Item 4: 1 unit (1 \u00d7 50 = 50)\n       - Item 5: 1 unit (1 \u00d7 16 = 16)\n\n     - My total value for this is:\n       - 84 + 150 + 72 + 50 + 16 = 372\n     - This is still less than my outside offer of 456, so I'll try another.\n\n     - Test:\n       - Keep: Item 1: 2 units (84), Item 2: 2 units (150), Item 3: 2 units (48), Item 4: 1 unit (50), Item 5: 4 units (64)\n\n     - My total value becomes:\n       - 84 + 150 + 48 + 50 + 64 = 396\n     - Attempt once more because this value is lower.\n\n     - Try:\n       - Keep: Item 1: 2 units (84), Item 2: 0 units (0), Item 3: 6 units (144), Item 4: 2 units (100), Item 5: 1 unit (16)\n\n     - My total value becomes:\n       - 84 + 0 + 144 + 100 + 16 = 344\n     - Attempt once more since outcome is not competitive with my outside offer.\n\n     - Finally, check:\n       - Keep: Item 1: 2 units (84), Item 2: 1 unit (75), Item 3: 4 units (96), Item 4: 2 unit (100), Item 5: 2 unit (32)\n\n     - My total value becomes:\n       - 84 + 75 + 96 + 100 + 32 = 387\n     - Still below the outside offer.\n\n   Since none of the considered allocations reach or exceed my outside offer value, and accepting the current offer is much worse than my fallback position, the best action is to WALK away from this negotiation. This aligns with not making mistakes such as accepting a worse offer or proposing a worse counteroffer.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n   - **My Action:** Since none of the proposed counteroffers (tested above) exceed the outside offer, and accepting the current offer does not serve my interests, I will walk away.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 5\n*   **Values of the items:** item 1: 98, item 2: 75, item 3: 53, item 4: 81, item 5: 58\n*   **Total pool of items:** 1 unit of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5\n*   **Discount factor:** 0.98. This means that getting a deal in a later round is slightly less valuable than getting it now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 0, 0, 3, 6]. This means I would receive:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 98 = 98\n    *   0 units of item 2: 0 * 75 = 0\n    *   0 units of item 3: 0 * 53 = 0\n    *   3 units of item 4: 3 * 81 = 243\n    *   6 units of item 5: 6 * 58 = 348\n    *   Total value: 98 + 0 + 0 + 243 + 348 = 689\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** 689 > 5. So, accepting the current offer is much better than walking away *right now*.\n\n3) **Consider a counteroffer:**\n\nBefore deciding to accept, I should consider if a counteroffer might yield an even better outcome. Since it's only round 1, I have room to negotiate. The current offer heavily favors me, giving almost everything. It is likely Player 1 made a mistake. Given that it favors me so much, there is no need to negotiate.\n\n4) **Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer is vastly better than my outside offer.\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 320. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 612 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 0, 1, 1, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party.

However, in subsequent rounds, the net value of offers will decrease. It's important to secure a deal before the last round to avoid the implications of multiple rounds on value.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n#### Current Offer (if any):\n- There is no current offer on the table for me to accept. I am responsible for making the initial offer.\n\n#### Evaluate Potential Counteroffers:\n\nBefore making a counteroffer, I should value potential divisions of items to ensure they exceed my outside offer value of 320.\n\n#### Consideration of Possible Offers:\nI'll begin by calculating values for different allocations, aiming to retain a division of items to myself that offers a total value greater than 320:\n\n1. **Propose keeping [3, 1, 2, 0, 6]:**\n   - Item 1: \\(3 \\times 17 = 51\\)\n   - Item 2: \\(1 \\times 71 = 71\\)\n   - Item 3: \\(2 \\times 76 = 152\\)\n   - Item 4: \\(0 \\times 2 = 0\\)\n   - Item 5: \\(6 \\times 38 = 228\\)\n   - Total Value = 51 + 71 + 152 + 0 + 228 = 502\n\nThis value exceeds my outside offer of 320, ensuring that this division of items secures a better outcome for me than walking away without a deal.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision Based on the Analysis\n\nWith no current offer to ACCEPT and the need to propose an offer better than my outside offer value, the best action is to present a COUNTEROFFER.\n\nBased on my analysis, I will make the following offer to Player 2:\n\nOffer all remaining items to Player 2: [0, 0, 3, 3, 0].\n\n**My Proposed Counteroffer:**\n\n- I keep [3, 1, 2, 0, 6] for myself, ensuring a total value higher than my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 3, 3, 0]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 851.\n   - My values for the items are: item 1 = 88, item 2 = 45, item 3 = 46, item 4 = 10, item 5 = 50.\n   - The total pool of items is: item 1 = 3, item 2 = 1, item 3 = 5, item 4 = 3, item 5 = 6.\n   - The discount factor is 0.98. This means that accepting an offer later is slightly less valuable than accepting it now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 0, 3, 3, 0]. This means they keep 3 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 6 units of item 5. The value of the current offer to *me* is: 0 * 88 + 0 * 45 + 3 * 46 + 3 * 10 + 0 * 50 = 0 + 0 + 138 + 30 + 0 = 168.\n   - **Comparison to outside offer:** 168 is significantly less than my outside offer of 851. Therefore, accepting this offer would be a mistake.\n\n   - **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to find an offer that gives me a value greater than 851. To avoid mistakes, I should ensure my offer is better than my outside offer, and it should be better than my previous offer (if any).\n\nLet's calculate the value I would get if I kept all the items:\n3 * 88 + 1 * 45 + 5 * 46 + 3 * 10 + 6 * 50 = 264 + 45 + 230 + 30 + 300 = 869. This is slightly better than my outside offer.\n\nNow, let's explore a counteroffer. I want to keep most of the value for myself, and avoid Mistake 3, which is offering nothing or everything to my opponent.\n\nI need to give Player 1 something, but not too much.\nI can start by giving Player 1 only units of the items I value the least, which is item 4. The total value for item 4 is only 10 * 3 = 30.\n\nI will give Player 1 all 3 units of Item 4 and 0 of everything else, then calculate how much that is worth to me:\nKeeping [3, 1, 5, 0, 6]\n3 * 88 + 1 * 45 + 5 * 46 + 0 * 10 + 6 * 50 = 264 + 45 + 230 + 0 + 300 = 839\nThis is lower than my outside offer.\n\nSo, let's give Player 1 1 unit of item 3 and 3 units of item 4, keeping everything else.\nKeeping [3, 1, 4, 0, 6]\n3 * 88 + 1 * 45 + 4 * 46 + 0 * 10 + 6 * 50 = 264 + 45 + 184 + 0 + 300 = 793\nStill lower than outside offer.\n\nOkay, I must give Player 1 more than just the lowest value items.\n\nLet's give Player 1 1 unit of item 1, and 3 units of item 4.\nKeeping [2, 1, 5, 0, 6]\n2 * 88 + 1 * 45 + 5 * 46 + 0 * 10 + 6 * 50 = 176 + 45 + 230 + 0 + 300 = 751\n\nLet's calculate if I give all item 5 away to Player 1.\nKeeping [3, 1, 5, 3, 0]\n3 * 88 + 1 * 45 + 5 * 46 + 3 * 10 + 0 * 50 = 264 + 45 + 230 + 30 + 0 = 569\n\nOkay, I am thinking I will give some of item 3, and item 4.\n\nCounteroffer: I will offer [0, 0, 2, 3, 0] to Player 1.\nKeeping [3, 1, 3, 0, 6]\n3 * 88 + 1 * 45 + 3 * 46 + 0 * 10 + 6 * 50 = 264 + 45 + 138 + 0 + 300 = 747\n\nLet's increase the amounts: [0, 0, 1, 3, 0].\nKeeping [3, 1, 4, 0, 6]\n3 * 88 + 1 * 45 + 4 * 46 + 0 * 10 + 6 * 50 = 264 + 45 + 184 + 0 + 300 = 793\n\nSo, my counteroffer is going to be the following: I will offer player 1 [0, 0, 0, 3, 0].\nKeeping [3, 1, 5, 0, 6]. The value to me is:\n3 * 88 + 1 * 45 + 5 * 46 + 0 * 10 + 6 * 50 = 264 + 45 + 230 + 0 + 300 = 839. Still less than outside offer.\nLet's give a bit of item 2 as well: [0, 1, 0, 3, 0].\nKeeping [3, 0, 5, 0, 6]\n3 * 88 + 0 * 45 + 5 * 46 + 0 * 10 + 6 * 50 = 264 + 0 + 230 + 0 + 300 = 794\n\nLet's provide a counteroffer of [0, 0, 0, 3, 1].\nKeeping [3, 1, 5, 0, 5].\n3 * 88 + 1 * 45 + 5 * 46 + 0 * 10 + 5 * 50 = 264 + 45 + 230 + 0 + 250 = 789.\nLess than outside offer.\nOffer: [0, 0, 1, 3, 0]\nKeeping: [3, 1, 4, 0, 6] = 793\nIf the negotiation ends this round, my value is 793 * 0.98 = 777.14\n\nLet's walk away, as all these are less than outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 925. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 855 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 3, 4, 4, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    89 x 5 + 10 x 3 + 81 x 4 + 31 x 4 + 74 x 0\n    which is 923 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 925. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 208\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 37, Item 2: 39, Item 3: 2, Item 4: 50, Item 5: 38\n*   **Total items:** Item 1: 5, Item 2: 4, Item 3: 4, Item 4: 4, Item 5: 2\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.98. This means an offer accepted in a later round is worth slightly less to both players.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 1, 0, 4, 0]. This means I would receive:\n    *   Item 1: 5 - 0 = 5 units\n    *   Item 2: 4 - 1 = 3 units\n    *   Item 3: 4 - 0 = 4 units\n    *   Item 4: 4 - 4 = 0 units\n    *   Item 5: 2 - 0 = 2 units\n\n    My total value for accepting this offer would be: (5 * 37) + (3 * 39) + (4 * 2) + (0 * 50) + (2 * 38) = 185 + 117 + 8 + 0 + 76 = 386\n\n    Since 386 > 208, accepting the current offer is better than walking away *right now*.\n\n3)  **Consider counteroffers:** Before making a counteroffer, let's look at the previous round. I offered [0, 4, 4, 0, 1] and they offered [0, 1, 0, 4, 0].\n\nLet's think about making a counteroffer that is more advantageous but also might get accepted.  I want more item 4, since I value it highly. I could offer [0, 1, 2, 2, 0].\nThis would leave me with:\n*   Item 1: 5 - 0 = 5 units\n*   Item 2: 4 - 1 = 3 units\n*   Item 3: 4 - 2 = 2 units\n*   Item 4: 4 - 2 = 2 units\n*   Item 5: 2 - 0 = 2 units\nMy total value = (5 * 37) + (3 * 39) + (2 * 2) + (2 * 50) + (2 * 38) = 185 + 117 + 4 + 100 + 76 = 482.\n\nNow, if I accept Player 1's current offer I get a value of 386. If I walk I get 208. If I counteroffer [0, 1, 2, 2, 0] I get 482. However, the discount rate is 0.98, which means that if I counteroffer and then in the next round I accept an offer (or walk), my utility will be scaled by 0.98.\n\nConsidering all this, it would be best to counteroffer in this round as it is a better payoff than the current offer or walking away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 2, 2, 0]}\n```",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 751. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 751. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 972 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 6, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    42 x 2 + 25 x 0 + 95 x 6 + 66 x 0 + 96 x 1\n    which is 750 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 751. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

                    "response": "To decide on the best action, let's go through the step-by-step analysis as outlined:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 751.\n   - My values for the items are:\n     - Item 1: 42\n     - Item 2: 25 (even though there are 0 units)\n     - Item 3: 95\n     - Item 4: 66\n     - Item 5: 96\n   - The total pool of items is: \n     - 2 units of item 1\n     - 0 units of item 2\n     - 9 units of item 3\n     - 5 units of item 4\n     - 3 units of item 5\n   - The discount factor gamma is 0.98, meaning if the negotiation proceeds to further rounds, the value of any agreement is slightly diminished. However, since we are in round 1, the discount factor hasn't affected any outcomes yet.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - There is no current offer on the table to evaluate.\n\n3) **Propose a specific counteroffer:**\n   - Since I need to make an initial offer, I should propose a distribution that is better than my outside offer of 751.\n   - I can try to aim for a total value as close to my maximum value as possible. Let\u2019s consider an offer where I keep values with a total greater than 751.\n   \n   Let\u2019s calculate an offer where I keep most items of high value:\n   - I propose keeping [1 unit of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5].\n   - Offering then (to Player 2): [1, 0, 4, 3, 2].\n\n   **My total value calculation will be:**\n   - Item 1: 1 x 42 = 42\n   - Item 2: 0 x 25 = 0\n   - Item 3: 5 x 95 = 475\n   - Item 4: 2 x 66 = 132\n   - Item 5: 1 x 96 = 96\n\n   Total value = 42 + 0 + 475 + 132 + 96 = 745\n\n   - This is clearly less than 751, which is my outside offer. I need to adjust the proposition because this doesn't meet the criteria of being better than my fallback.\n\n   Retrying the calculation:\n   - Let's adjust to keeping the more valuable items closer to my outside offer and modify to [1, 0, 6, 2, 1].\n   - Offering then (to Player 2): [1, 0, 3, 3, 2].\n\n   **My new value calculation will be:**\n   - Item 1: 1 x 42 = 42\n   - Item 2: 0 x 25 = 0\n   - Item 3: 6 x 95 = 570\n   - Item 4: 2 x 66 = 132\n   - Item 5: 1 x 96 = 96\n\n   Total value = 42 + 0 + 570 + 132 + 96 = 840\n\n   This value is now clearly more than my outside offer, thus providing a better option for me.\n\nTherefore, my initial offer to Player 2 will be [1, 0, 3, 3, 2].\n\n**My action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 3, 3, 2]}\n```",

This means that accepting an offer in a later round is slightly less valuable than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 0, 3, 3, 2]. This means I would receive:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 89 = 89\n    *   0 units of item 2: 0 * 78 = 0\n    *   3 units of item 3: 3 * 67 = 201\n    *   3 units of item 4: 3 * 12 = 36\n    *   2 units of item 5: 2 * 35 = 70\n    *   Total value of current offer: 89 + 0 + 201 + 36 + 70 = 396\n    *   This is much less than my outside offer of 934.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what I can offer Player 1 that would be acceptable while still giving me a value greater than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Making a decision:**\n\n*   Accepting the current offer (396) is worse than my outside offer (934).\n*   Walking away would give me 934.\n*   I should propose a counteroffer. Let's calculate what I would keep if I gave Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]:\n    *   2 units of item 1: 2 * 89 = 178\n    *   0 units of item 2: 0 * 78 = 0\n    *   9 units of item 3: 9 * 67 = 603\n    *   5 units of item 4: 5 * 12 = 60\n    *   3 units of item 5: 3 * 35 = 105\n    *   Total value if I kept everything: 178 + 0 + 603 + 60 + 105 = 946\n\n    This is very close to my outside offer, so I need to be careful. Let's try to improve on the original offer by offering slightly less of item 3, since I have a lot of that. I'll offer [1, 0, 2, 2, 1] instead. This means I keep [1, 0, 7, 3, 2]:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 89 = 89\n    *   0 units of item 2: 0 * 78 = 0\n    *   7 units of item 3: 7 * 67 = 469\n    *   3 units of item 4: 3 * 12 = 36\n    *   2 units of item 5: 2 * 35 = 70\n    *   Total value: 89 + 0 + 469 + 36 + 70 = 664\n\n    This is not high enough to justify the risk. Let's try an offer where I keep slightly more. How about offering [1, 0, 4, 3, 2]? This would leave me with [1, 0, 5, 2, 1].\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 89 = 89\n    *   0 units of item 2: 0 * 78 = 0\n    *   5 units of item 3: 5 * 67 = 335\n    *   2 units of item 4: 2 * 12 = 24\n    *   1 unit of item 5: 1 * 35 = 35\n    *   Total value: 89 + 0 + 335 + 24 + 35 = 483\n This is much lower than my outside offer\n\nI should offer Player 1 a deal that at least makes me better off than my outside offer.\nI think a reasonable offer is [0, 0, 2, 2, 1].

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 6, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    42 x 2 + 25 x 0 + 95 x 6 + 66 x 0 + 96 x 1\n    which is 750 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 751. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 3, 3, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

This means that accepting an offer in a later round is slightly less valuable than accepting the same offer in an earlier round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 0, 4, 3, 2]. This means I would get:\n    *   2 units of item 1: 2 * 89 = 178\n    *   0 units of item 2: 0 * 78 = 0\n    *   5 units of item 3: 5 * 67 = 335\n    *   2 units of item 4: 2 * 12 = 24\n    *   1 unit of item 5: 1 * 35 = 35\n    *   Total value: 178 + 0 + 335 + 24 + 35 = 572\n    *   Discounted value: 572 * (0.98)^(2-1) = 572 * 0.98 = 560.56\n\n    This is less than my outside offer of 934.\n\n*   **Consider Mistake 4:** Accepting this offer would be Mistake 4 because 560.56 < 934.\n\n*   **Consider a potential counteroffer:** Let's evaluate some counteroffers. I will only consider counteroffers that have a value to me that is > 934. Since there is only one round left after this one, I will not use the discount factor in this evaluation.\n\n    *   **Counteroffer 1:** I offer Player 1 [1, 0, 4, 2, 1]. This means I keep:\n        *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 89 = 89\n        *   0 unit of item 2: 0 * 78 = 0\n        *   5 units of item 3: 5 * 67 = 335\n        *   3 units of item 4: 3 * 12 = 36\n        *   2 unit of item 5: 2 * 35 = 70\n        *   Total value: 89 + 0 + 335 + 36 + 70 = 530. This is less than 934, so this offer would be Mistake 2.\n\n    *   **Counteroffer 2:** I offer Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I keep:\n        *   2 units of item 1: 2 * 89 = 178\n        *   0 unit of item 2: 0 * 78 = 0\n        *   9 units of item 3: 9 * 67 = 603\n        *   5 units of item 4: 5 * 12 = 60\n        *   3 unit of item 5: 3 * 35 = 105\n        *   Total value: 178 + 0 + 603 + 60 + 105 = 946. This is greater than 934.\n        *   This would be Mistake 3, but the game ends if I provide a counteroffer at this round, so I would get a value of 946.\n\n    *   **Counteroffer 3:** To avoid Mistake 3, lets try offering at least one of something. I offer Player 1 [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]. This means I keep:\n        *   2 units of item 1: 2 * 89 = 178\n        *   0 unit of item 2: 0 * 78 = 0\n        *   8 units of item 3: 8 * 67 = 536\n        *   5 units of item 4: 5 * 12 = 60\n        *   3 unit of item 5: 3 * 35 = 105\n        *   Total value: 178 + 0 + 536 + 60 + 105 = 879. This is less than 934.\n\n    Since there is only one round left, making a counteroffer is the same as walking away.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\nSince the current offer is worse than my outside offer, and it is the last round, I need to make the best of it. Making a counteroffer will yield my item values, since Player 1 will not be able to respond. I need to make a counteroffer where the total item value is greater than 934.\n\nThe best option seems to be to offer Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 6, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    42 x 2 + 25 x 0 + 95 x 6 + 66 x 0 + 96 x 1\n    which is 750 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 751. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 3, 3, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 4, 3, 2]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To make an informed decision, let's go through the questions step by step:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n   - **What is my outside offer value?**\n     - My outside offer value is 751.\n     \n   - **What are the values of the items involved?**\n     - Item 1: 42 per unit\n     - Item 2: 25 per unit\n     - Item 3: 95 per unit\n     - Item 4: 66 per unit\n     - Item 5: 96 per unit\n\n   - **What is the total pool of items?**\n     - Item 1: 2 units\n     - Item 2: 0 units\n     - Item 3: 9 units\n     - Item 4: 5 units\n     - Item 5: 3 units\n\n   - **How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?**\n     - The discount factor is 0.98. Given that this is the last round, any delay in finalizing the deal means no further discount impact, but given my outside offer is considerable, I should be careful to not accept anything worse than this amount.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?**\n     - Current offer on the table is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], which means I get all items:\n       - Total value = 2\\*42 + 0\\*25 + 9\\*95 + 5\\*66 + 3\\*96 = 84 + 0 + 855 + 330 + 288 = 1557\n       - Even if I get nothing from this offer, I walk away with my outside offer value which is 751. \n       - The offer from Player 2 is essentially a walkaway situation since they offer nothing.\n\n   - **For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?**\n     - I need a counteroffer where my total retained value is greater than 751. Since this is round 3, any counteroffer would be effectively a walk for Player 2 if they don't accept it immediately.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   - The current offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] gives me the calculated total value of having everything, which is 1557.\n   - Since Player 2 is essentially offering nothing, I should not accept this, as it doesn\u2019t give me any benefit over taking my guaranteed outside offer.\n\n   - Should I make a counteroffer? Since this is the last round and a counteroffer would be treated as a walk by Player 2, it is not practical to make a counteroffer that is worse for me than just walking away.\n   \nTherefore, given the situation, my best action is to walk away and take the outside offer, as it is guaranteed value for me. \n\n**My Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 0, 7, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 6, 2, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To make an informed decision in this negotiation scenario, let's go through the analysis step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer value is 522.\n- **Values of the Items Involved**:\n  - Item 1: 79\n  - Item 2: 1\n  - Item 3: 24\n  - Item 4: 51\n  - Item 5: 65\n- **Total Pool of Items**:\n  - 3 units of item 1\n  - 6 units of item 2\n  - 7 units of item 3\n  - 1 unit of item 4\n  - 2 units of item 5\n- **Discount Factor**: The discount factor, gamma, is 0.98. Since it's round 2, the value of any accepted offer would be multiplied by \\(0.98^{1}\\).\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer**: Player 2 is offering me [0, 2, 0, 0, 0].\n  - Value of current offer to me:\n    - Item 2: 2 units \u00d7 1 = 2\n  - Total value for the current offer: 2\n  - Adjusted for discount: \\(2 \\times 0.98 = 1.96\\)\n\n- **Compare to Outside Offer**: My outside offer is 522. Clearly, \\(1.96 \\ll 522\\). So, accepting the current offer is not beneficial.\n\n- **Potential Counteroffers**: I need to find a division that gives me a total value higher than 522.\n  \n  Let's calculate the value of some potential divisions where I keep as much value as possible:\n  \n  A potential offer to Player 2 could be [0, 6, 0, 0, 0], where I keep everything else:\n  - Value to me: \\(3 \\times 79 + 7 \\times 24 + 1 \\times 51 + 2 \\times 65 = 237 + 168 + 51 + 130 = 586\\)\n  - With discount: \\(586 \\times 0.98 = 574.28\\), which is greater than my outside offer.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nThe current offer from Player 2 is way below my outside offer. Analyzing potential counteroffers, a division where I keep high-value items ensures my value exceeds the outside offer. Thus, I should propose a counteroffer that reflects this strategy:\n\n**Counteroffer to Player 2**: [0, 6, 0, 0, 0] (I give Player 2 all of item 2, which is least valuable to me, and keep the rest).\n\nThe total value with this counteroffer is beneficial for me and exceeds my outside offer.

This means that an offer in the next round is worth 98% of the value of the same offer this round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 6, 0, 0, 0]. This means I receive 0 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n    *   My value for this offer: (0 * 44) + (6 * 15) + (0 * 32) + (0 * 3) + (0 * 2) = 0 + 90 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 90.\n    *   This is significantly less than my outside offer of 419.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 419. I currently have the following items: 3 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 2 units of item 5. My total value is (3 * 44) + (0 * 15) + (7 * 32) + (1 * 3) + (2 * 2) = 132 + 0 + 224 + 3 + 4 = 363. This plus the current offer value of 90 = 453 which is the total pool value to me.\n\nNow I will explore possible counteroffers. It's round 2, so I need to factor in the discount. Let's target for a round 3 value >= 419/0.98 = 427.55. So I need a current value >=427.55\n\nI currently possess 3 items of type 1, 7 of type 3, 1 of type 4, and 2 of type 5. The current offer gives me 6 of item 2.\n\nMy counteroffer should be such that the items I keep have a value over 427.55, so the items I give away (offer) must have a value less than 453-427.55 = 25.45\n\nI will offer 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 2 of item 5.\nThe value of the offer is (0 * 44) + (0 * 15) + (1 * 32) + (1 * 3) + (2 * 2) = 0 + 0 + 32 + 3 + 4 = 39.\nThe value for me is 453 - 39 = 414. Since 414 < 419, I need to increase my value.\nI will offer 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 2 of item 5.\nThe value of the offer is (0 * 44) + (0 * 15) + (0 * 32) + (1 * 3) + (2 * 2) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 3 + 4 = 7.\nThe value for me is 453 - 7 = 446.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1032. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 792 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 1, 3, 5, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    85 x 4 + 41 x 1 + 20 x 3 + 42 x 5 + 76 x 5\n    which is 1031 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1032. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 3, 1, 5, 5]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 3, 1, 5, 5]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value: 1032\n   - Item values: Item 1 = 85, Item 2 = 41, Item 3 = 20, Item 4 = 42, Item 5 = 76\n   - Total items: Item 1 = 5, Item 2 = 5, Item 3 = 4, Item 4 = 5, Item 5 = 5\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.98. This means that accepting an offer in a later round is slightly less valuable than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer:** [0, 3, 1, 5, 5] means I receive 0 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 5 units of item 5.  This means Player 1 receives 5 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5. My value for accepting this offer is:\n     (0 * 85) + (3 * 41) + (1 * 20) + (5 * 42) + (5 * 76) = 0 + 123 + 20 + 210 + 380 = 733\n\n   - **Comparison to outside offer:** 733 < 1032. Accepting the current offer is worse than my outside offer.\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:**  I need to find an offer that gives me a value greater than 1032. Let's start by trying to give Player 1 close to an equal division and then adjust. I have a total of 24 items and Player 1 has so far offered [5, 2, 3, 0, 0] or a total of 10 items, so giving them more items is a better strategy than what they are offering right now. Let's try giving them 2 of each item.\n\n    My offer: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]\n    My remaining items: [3, 3, 2, 3, 3]\n    My value: (3 * 85) + (3 * 41) + (2 * 20) + (3 * 42) + (3 * 76) = 255 + 123 + 40 + 126 + 228 = 772\n\nThis value is lower than the outside offer so it is not a good counter offer.\n\nLet's try offering Player 1 just the minimum amount of each item to exceed my outside offer.\n\nMy offer: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nMy value: (5*85) + (5*41) + (4*20) + (5*42) + (5*76) = 425+205+80+210+380 = 1300.\n\nMy offer: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nMy value: (4*85) + (4*41) + (3*20) + (4*42) + (4*76) = 340+164+60+168+304 = 1036.\n\nOkay, this counteroffer seems promising. It gives me a value of 1036, which is greater than my outside offer of 1032.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n   - Accepting the current offer: No (value is 733 < 1032)\n   - Walking away: Not yet, there may be a better outcome.\n   - Propose a counteroffer: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```",

My value would be:\n(5 * 85) + (5 * 41) + (4 * 20) + (5 * 42) + (4 * 76) = 425 + 205 + 80 + 210 + 304 = 1224\n\nLet's consider giving up 1 unit of Item 1.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 3, 1, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    14 x 4 + 68 x 3 + 81 x 1 + 78 x 0 + 53 x 0\n    which is 341 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 342. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

The present value is calculated as \\(\\text{negotiation outcome} \\times 0.9604\\).\n\n### 2) Assess the value of offers:\n\n- **Current offer:** [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  \n  - My total value if I accept this offer is 0. Since this is less than my outside offer of 342, accepting this offer is a mistake (specifically Mistake 4).\n\n- **Potential counteroffers:**\n  - Let's try to find a division that provides me with a value greater than 342, considering the discount factor \\(0.9604\\).\n\n#### Calculating potential divisions\n1. **Quick estimation:**\n   - For simplicity, I will start by considering keeping more of high-value items like items 3, 4, and 2, since they have the highest per unit value.\n\n2. **Potential counteroffer division:** Let's consider keeping 2 units of each item except item 3, where I'll keep 3 units, which translates to offering Player 2 the remaining units. So I give Player 2 the following:\n   - Item 1: 3 units\n   - Item 2: 3 units\n   - Item 3: 1 unit (1 unit is offered as item 3 has only 4 units)\n   - Item 4: 3 units\n   - Item 5: 3 units\n\n3. **Calculate my value and compare:**\n   - Keep 2 units of item 1: \\(2 \\times 14 = 28\\)\n   - Keep 2 units of item 2: \\(2 \\times 68 = 136\\)\n   - Keep 3 units of item 3: \\(3 \\times 81 = 243\\)\n   - Keep 2 units of item 4: \\(2 \\times 78 = 156\\)\n   - Keep 2 units of item 5: \\(2 \\times 53 = 106\\)\n   - Total without discount: \\(28 + 136 + 243 + 156 + 106 = 669\\)\n   - Total with discount: \\(669 \\times 0.9604 = 642.79\\)\n\nSince 642.79 (my value with the discount factor applied) is greater than my outside offer of 342, this is a beneficial offer for me.\n\n### 3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n\nGiven that my calculated potential counteroffer provides me more value than my outside offer even after applying the discount, I should propose this counteroffer.\n\n**Proposed action in correct format:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 3, 1, 3, 3]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 177. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 942 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 4, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    86 x 0 + 28 x 1 + 37 x 4 + 90 x 0 + 73 x 0\n    which is 176 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 177. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

The current offer gives me 3 of item 3.\n\nSince I want to maximize my value while ensuring it's above 950, and giving player 1 nothing at all gives me 1145, I will try offering a small portion of the items to player 1, particularly the ones I value less. I need to give away 1145 - 950 = 195 worth of items.\n\nLet's try offering Player 1 [2, 1, 0, 0, 0].\nMy value = (5 * 65) + (3 * 40) + (6 * 77) + (1 * 49) + (1 * 19) = 325 + 120 + 462 + 49 + 19 = 975\nThis is better than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\nSince the current offer is worse than my outside offer, I should make a counteroffer.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 868. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 498 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 5, 1, 6, 7] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    27 x 4 + 3 x 5 + 30 x 1 + 29 x 6 + 77 x 7\n    which is 866 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 868. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To decide on my action, let's walk through the questions step by step:\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 868.\n   - The values of the items involved for me are:\n     - Item 1: 27 per unit\n     - Item 2: 3 per unit\n     - Item 3: 30 per unit\n     - Item 4: 29 per unit\n     - Item 5: 77 per unit\n   - The total pool of items consists of:\n     - 5 units of item 1\n     - 5 units of item 2\n     - 1 unit of item 3\n     - 6 units of item 4\n     - 7 units of item 5\n   - The discount factor (gamma) is 0.98. This means that the value of an outcome decreases slightly if the negotiation takes additional rounds. However, since this is the first round, the discount factor doesn't apply yet.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - There is no current offer on the table.\n   - I need to assess potential counteroffers to ensure they are better than my outside offer value of 868.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - I should propose a counteroffer that provides me a value greater than 868. This ensures my proposal is worth more than my outside option, avoiding Mistake 2.\n   - Let's explore potential counteroffers:\n\n   Let's start with the maximum units of each item and calculate the total value to me:\n   - 5 units of item 1 = 5 \u00d7 27 = 135\n   - 5 units of item 2 = 5 \u00d7 3 = 15\n   - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 30 = 30\n   - 6 units of item 4 = 6 \u00d7 29 = 174\n   - 7 units of item 5 = 7 \u00d7 77 = 539\n   - Total value = 893\n\n   The total value exceeds my outside offer by a small amount, so I need to adjust the distribution such that the value to me remains greater than 868.\n\n   Let's attempt an offer where I give Player 2 some units:\n\n   Offer: Give Player 2 [1, 2, 0, 0, 0] items:\n   - I keep 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 27 = 108\n   - I keep 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9\n   - I keep 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 30 = 30\n   - I keep 6 units of item 4 = 6 \u00d7 29 = 174\n   - I keep 7 units of item 5 = 7 \u00d7 77 = 539\n   - Total value = 860\n\n   This value is still less than my outside offer. Let's adjust further:\n\n   Offer: Give Player 2 [1, 5, 0, 0, 2] items:\n   - I keep 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 27 = 108\n   - I keep 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 3 = 0\n   - I keep 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 30 = 30\n   - I keep 6 units of item 4 = 6 \u00d7 29 = 174\n   - I keep 5 units of item 5 = 5 \u00d7 77 = 385\n   - Total value = 697\n\n   Still too low. Let's optimize more:\n\n   Offer: Give Player 2 [0, 4, 0, 1, 1] items:\n   - I keep 5 units of item 1 = 5 \u00d7 27 = 135\n   - I keep 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 3 = 3\n   - I keep 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 30 = 30\n   - I keep 5 units of item 4 = 5 \u00d7 29 = 145\n   - I keep 6 units of item 5 = 6 \u00d7 77 = 462\n   - Total value = 775\n\n   I am unable to create a valid distribution that exceeds my outside offer without reconsidering my calculations. As such, I will utilize my best offer thus far before the WALK contingency. \n\n   Offer: Give Player 2 [1, 5, 0, 0, 1] items:\n   - I keep 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 27 = 108\n   - I keep 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 3 = 0\n   - I keep 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 30 = 30\n   - I keep 6 units of item 4 = 6 \u00d7 29 = 174\n   - I keep 6 units of item 5 = 6 \u00d7 77 = 462\n   - Total value = 874, which is greater than my outside offer.\n\nThis counteroffer allows me to receive a value greater than my outside offer of 868.

This means that an offer accepted in a later round is worth slightly less than an offer accepted now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [1, 5, 0, 0, 1]. This means I receive:\n    *   item 1: 1 unit\n    *   item 2: 5 units\n    *   item 3: 0 units\n    *   item 4: 0 units\n    *   item 5: 1 unit\n    My value for this offer is: (1 * 68) + (5 * 1) + (0 * 41) + (0 * 5) + (1 * 17) = 68 + 5 + 0 + 0 + 17 = 90\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (90) is significantly worse than my outside offer (249). Accepting would be Mistake 4.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider counteroffers that give me a value greater than 249. Let's try keeping all the items initially and then adjusting.\n\n    * Keeping [5, 5, 1, 6, 7]: value = (5 * 68) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 41) + (6 * 5) + (7 * 17) = 340 + 5 + 41 + 30 + 119 = 535\n\nNow, I want to construct a counteroffer that gives me at least 249 value while also being reasonable for Player 1. My current value is 535.\n\nI need to offer player 1 some items to get them to agree, but I don't want to go below my outside offer of 249.\nSince item 1 is my highest valued item, it would be costly for me to offer much of it to Player 1.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 868. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 498 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 5, 1, 6, 7] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    27 x 4 + 3 x 5 + 30 x 1 + 29 x 6 + 77 x 7\n    which is 866 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 868. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 5, 0, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 4, 0, 3, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 4, 0, 3, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

This means I would have:\n    *   Item 1: 2 * 84 = 168\n    *   Item 2: 1 * 62 = 62\n    *   Item 3: 0 * 22 = 0\n    *   Item 4: 1 * 4 = 4\n    *   Item 5: 1 * 81 = 81\n    *   Total value = 168 + 62 + 0 + 4 + 81 = 315\n\nThis is less than my outside offer of 475.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 475.\n    I can try keeping all of the items for myself initially, which yields my total value:\n    (7 * 84) + (2 * 62) + (1 * 22) + (2 * 4) + (1 * 81) = 588 + 124 + 22 + 8 + 81 = 823\n    I want to give player 1 some items while also ensuring I get at least 475.\n\n    Let's try to construct an offer where I keep [5, 1, 1, 1, 0] for myself, offering the rest to player 1: [2, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n    (5 * 84) + (1 * 62) + (1 * 22) + (1 * 4) + (0 * 81) = 420 + 62 + 22 + 4 = 508\n\nThis is better than my outside offer. The offer to the other player would be [2, 1, 0, 1, 1].\n\nLet's try another counteroffer, keeping [6, 2, 1, 2, 1] for myself:\n(6 * 84) + (2 * 62) + (1 * 22) + (2 * 4) + (1 * 81) = 504 + 124 + 22 + 8 + 81 = 739\nI would be giving the other player [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This seems unbalanced since I would have most of the items.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer of [2, 1, 0, 1, 1] is worth 315 to me, which is much less than my outside offer of 475. I should not accept.\n\nOffering [2, 1, 0, 1, 1] to player 1 would leave me with a value of 508, which is greater than my outside offer. It would be reasonable to propose this.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 0, 1, 1]}\n",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 342. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 342. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 615 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 0, 1, 2, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    53 x 3 + 41 x 0 + 19 x 1 + 70 x 2 + 22 x 1\n    which is 340 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 342. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 0, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value: 342\n   - Values of the items to me:\n     - Item 1: 53 per unit\n     - Item 2: 41 per unit\n     - Item 3: 19 per unit\n     - Item 4: 70 per unit\n     - Item 5: 22 per unit\n   - Total pool of items: [7, 2, 1, 2, 1]\n   - Discount factor influence: Given a discount rate of 0.98, accepting the offer in round 2 means it's worth slightly less than it would have been in round 1. The value is multiplied by 0.98^(2-1) = 0.98. Therefore, any offer should be compared to 342 reduced by the discount factor for this round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** [2, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n     - Calculation of the value to me if I accept this offer:\n       - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 53 = 106\n       - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 41 = 41\n       - 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 19 = 0\n       - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 70 = 70\n       - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 22 = 22\n     - Total value = 106 + 41 + 0 + 70 + 22 = 239\n     - Discounted value at round 2 = 239 \u00d7 0.98 = approximately 234.22\n     - 234.22 is less than my outside offer of 342, so accepting this offer is not a good choice.\n   \n   - **Potential counteroffers:** I need to make a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer value. Let's iterate to find such an offer:\n     - If I keep [3, 0, 1, 1, 1] (offering the rest to Player 2: [4, 2, 0, 1, 0]), my value is calculated as follows:\n       - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159\n       - 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 41 = 0\n       - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 19 = 19\n       - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 70 = 70\n       - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 22 = 22\n     - Total value = 159 + 0 + 19 + 70 + 22 = 270\n     - Because 270 \u00d7 0.98 = 264.6, it still doesn't exceed my outside offer.\n     - Increase the number of item 4:\n       - If I keep [3, 0, 1, 2, 1] (offering the rest to Player 2: [4, 2, 0, 0, 0]), my value is calculated as follows:\n       - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159\n       - 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 41 = 0\n       - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 19 = 19\n       - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 70 = 140\n       - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 22 = 22\n     - Total value = 159 + 0 + 19 + 140 + 22 = 340\n     - Discounted value at round 2 = 340 \u00d7 0.98 = 333.2\n     - 333.2 is still less than my outside offer of 342, but it is a much stronger position for negotiation.\n\nOn going through these options, proposing [4, 1, 0, 1, 0] gives me sufficient utility to be a close negotiation point:\n\n   - If I keep [3, 1, 1, 1, 1] (offering the rest to Player 2: [4, 1, 0, 1, 0]), my value would be:\n       - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159\n       - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 41 = 41\n       - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 19 = 19\n       - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 70 = 70\n       - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 22 = 22\n     - Total value = 159 + 41 + 19 + 70 + 22 = 311\n     - Discounted value at round 2 = 311 \u00d7 0.98 = 304.78\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n   Since none of these counteroffers provided a better alternative than my outside offer even after discounting, the rational choice is to WALK.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value: 234\n   - My values for items: [36, 23, 57, 3, 26]\n   - Total items: [9, 4, 2, 2, 3]\n   - Discount factor: 0.98. This means that accepting an offer in later rounds is slightly less valuable than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of the current offer:**\n   - Current offer to me: [3, 2, 0, 0, 1] (This is what PLAYER 1 is *offering* me)\n   - Items I keep: [9-3, 4-2, 2-0, 2-0, 3-1] = [6, 2, 2, 2, 2]\n   - Value of items I keep: (6 * 36) + (2 * 23) + (2 * 57) + (2 * 3) + (2 * 26) = 216 + 46 + 114 + 6 + 52 = 434\n   - 434 > 234 (my outside offer). So accepting this is better than walking away.\n\n3) **Consider a counteroffer:**\n\nLet's consider some potential counteroffers to see if we can improve upon 434. I need to make an offer to Player 1 that leaves me with a value greater than 234.\n\n*   **Counteroffer 1: Giving Player 1 half of everything:**\n    *   Offer: [4, 2, 1, 1, 1] (rounded down)\n    *   Items I keep: [5, 2, 1, 1, 2]\n    *   Value to me: (5 * 36) + (2 * 23) + (1 * 57) + (1 * 3) + (2 * 26) = 180 + 46 + 57 + 3 + 52 = 338\n\n*   **Counteroffer 2: A more aggressive counteroffer.**\n    Let's aim for a value close to my maximum, but still give Player 1 enough to accept. Let's try to keep [7, 3, 1, 1, 2].\n    *   Offer: [2, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n    *   Value to me: (7 * 36) + (3 * 23) + (1 * 57) + (1 * 3) + (2 * 26) = 252 + 69 + 57 + 3 + 52 = 433\n\n*   **Counteroffer 3: Give nothing**\n\n    This would result in me keeping everything, and value of 614, but I can't offer them nothing.\n    * Offer: [0,0,0,0,0]\n    * Value to me: (9 * 36) + (4 * 23) + (2 * 57) + (2 * 3) + (3 * 26) = 324 + 92 + 114 + 6 + 78 = 614\n\n**Decision:**\n\nThe current offer gives me a value of 434, which is better than my outside offer of 234. Counteroffer 1 gives me 338, and Counteroffer 2 gives me 433. Since the current offer (434) is better than all potential counteroffers, I should accept the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 98. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 459 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 0, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    70 x 1 + 16 x 0 + 40 x 0 + 15 x 1 + 12 x 1\n    which is 97 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 98. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Therefore, it is beneficial to reach an agreement as soon as possible, provided it is favorable in terms of value.\n\n### 2) Assess Value of Offers\n\n- **Potential Counteroffers**: I need to make an offer where the value to me is at least greater than my outside offer of 98. Let's evaluate the value of different divisions:\n\n  - Keeping 4 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5:\n    - Value = (4 \u00d7 70) + (0 \u00d7 16) + (3 \u00d7 40) + (1 \u00d7 15) + (1 \u00d7 12) = 280 + 0 + 120 + 15 + 12 = 427\n\nThis distribution values significantly more than my fallback 98, and is strategically in my favor while splitting some value to Player 2.\n\n### 3) Decision\n\nGiven that this is the initial round, and I do not have any current offer to consider, I will propose an initial offer that maximizes my value.\n\n**Proposed Offer**: I will offer Player 2 [1, 1, 2, 1, 1] units of items as follows:\n  - 1 unit of item 1\n  - 1 unit of item 2\n  - 2 units of item 3\n  - 1 unit of item 4\n  - 1 unit of item 5\n\nHere's my action:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 2, 1, 1]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 0, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    70 x 1 + 16 x 0 + 40 x 0 + 15 x 1 + 12 x 1\n    which is 97 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 98. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\n1) **Current Situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value is 815.\n*   My item values are: item 1 = 16, item 2 = 60, item 3 = 17, item 4 = 26, item 5 = 88.\n*   Total items: 1 of item 1, 7 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 4 of item 5.\n*   The discount factor gamma = 0.98. This means that offers in later rounds are worth slightly less to me than offers now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 2, 2, 2, 3]. This means I would receive:\n    *   1 unit of item 1 (value = 1 * 16 = 16)\n    *   2 units of item 2 (value = 2 * 60 = 120)\n    *   2 units of item 3 (value = 2 * 17 = 34)\n    *   2 units of item 4 (value = 2 * 26 = 52)\n    *   3 units of item 5 (value = 3 * 88 = 264)\n    *   Total value of current offer = 16 + 120 + 34 + 52 + 264 = 486. This is less than my outside offer.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Since I need to offer something to Player 1, let's first calculate what I have in total:\n    *   Item 1: 1 unit\n    *   Item 2: 7 units\n    *   Item 3: 3 units\n    *   Item 4: 2 units\n    *   Item 5: 4 units\n\n    Now, if I keep everything, my total value is: (1 * 16) + (7 * 60) + (3 * 17) + (2 * 26) + (4 * 88) = 16 + 420 + 51 + 52 + 352 = 891.\n\n    I want to make a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer (815). I need to ensure that the value of the items I keep is greater than 815.\n\n    Let's try giving away only item 1 and some of Item 3.\n    Offer: [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]. This means I keep [0, 7, 2, 2, 4]\n    The value of what I keep is:\n    (0 * 16) + (7 * 60) + (2 * 17) + (2 * 26) + (4 * 88) = 0 + 420 + 34 + 52 + 352 = 858\n\n    858 is greater than 815, so this is better than my outside option.\n\n3) **Decision:**\nThe current offer gives me 486, which is worse than my outside offer of 815. I will make a counteroffer where I give away item 1, one unit of item 3 and nothing else.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]}\n```",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 197. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 197. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 558 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 2, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    34 x 0 + 26 x 1 + 85 x 2 + 29 x 0 + 12 x 0\n    which is 196 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 197. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 2, 2, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 2, 2, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 4, 1, 0, 1]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Analyze the Current Situation:\n\n- **Outside Offer Value**: 197\n\n- **Values of Items**:\n  - Item 1: 34\n  - Item 2: 26\n  - Item 3: 85\n  - Item 4: 29\n  - Item 5: 12\n\n- **Total Pool of Items**:\n  - Item 1: 1 unit\n  - Item 2: 7 units\n  - Item 3: 3 units\n  - Item 4: 2 units\n  - Item 5: 4 units\n\n- **Discount Factor**: Since it's the third round and any counteroffer by Player 2 will not be viable (treated as a WALK if made in the last round), our focus is either on accepting the current offer or comparing it with our outside offer.\n\n### 2. Assess the Value of Offers:\n\n- **Current Offer**: [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  - Calculation for current offer:\n    - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 34 = 34\n    - Total value = 34\n\n- **Potential Counteroffers**: At this point, we must consider the value of any potential offer we might make. However, comparing with the outside offer (197), the current offer value (34) is much lower.\n\n### 3. Make a Decision Based on the Analysis:\n\n- **Current Offer**: The current offer gives a value of 34, which is significantly less than our outside offer of 197.\n- **Walking Away**: The outside offer of 197 is assured if we walk away, which is better than accepting the current offer.\n- **Proposing a Counteroffer**: Since this is the last round, Player 2 cannot make a counter counteroffer. Any counteroffer we make must, therefore, guarantee us a value greater than or equal to 197, which seems practically unfeasible given the limited pool of items and their values.\n\nConsidering the above, accepting the current offer is worse than choosing the outside offer. Proposing a counteroffer that would be accepted by Player 2 and that is also better than our outside offer is unlikely, based on the history and items' values.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

                    "response": "To make an informed decision, let's walk through the analysis step by step:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n   - **Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer is 1089.\n   - **Values of Items**:\n     - Item 1: 52 per unit\n     - Item 2: 62 per unit\n     - Item 3: 47 per unit\n     - Item 4: 58 per unit\n     - Item 5: 57 per unit\n   - **Total Pool of Items**:\n     - Item 1: 4 units\n     - Item 2: 7 units\n     - Item 3: 4 units\n     - Item 4: 3 units\n     - Item 5: 6 units\n   - **Discount Factor Influence**: As this is Round 1, the discount factor does not yet impact my decision, since we are at the initial stage.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers**:\n\n   To determine what I should offer to Player 2, I need to make sure that whatever I keep has a value greater than my outside offer of 1089. To do so, I will start by attempting to maximize what I keep from the given items. I will test a division scenario where I attempt to keep units of higher-valued items that make the total value on my side greater than 1089.\n\n   - To calculate, consider an initial division where I keep higher quantities of items of value to me until I exceed 1089:\n   \n     Let's say I keep 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 3 units of item 5. The rest will go to Player 2 as an initial offer:\n\n   - My kept values: \n     - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 52 = 52\n     - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 62 = 62\n     - 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 47 = 0\n     - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 58 = 58\n     - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171\n\n     Total value to me = 52 + 62 + 0 + 58 + 171 = 343\n\n   This does not exceed my outside offer, so I should keep more of the higher-valued items:\n\n   New attempt: 3 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n\n   - My kept values: \n     - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156\n     - 6 units of item 2 = 6 \u00d7 62 = 372\n     - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141\n     - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 58 = 116\n     - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171\n\n     Total value to me = 156 + 372 + 141 + 116 + 171 = 956\n\n   Still not enough, so I adjust to keep 3 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5, rechecking:\n   - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156\n   - 6 units of item 2 = 6 \u00d7 62 = 372\n   - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141\n   - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 58 = 116 \n   - 4 units of item 5 = 4 \u00d7 57 = 228\n\n   Total value to me = 156 + 372 + 141 + 116 + 228 = 1013\n\nLet's keep going until I exceed 1089:\n- Adjust to keep: 4 of item 1, 7 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 3 of item 4, 4 of item 5, then:\n\nRecalculate:\n- 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 52 = 208\n- 7 units of item 2 = 7 \u00d7 62 = 434\n- 4 units of item 3 = 4 \u00d7 47 = 188\n- 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174\n- 4 units of item 5 = 4 \u00d7 57 = 228\n\n   Total value to me = 208 + 434 + 188 + 174 + 228 = 1232 \n\nThis value exceeds 1089, but I can't actually propose to keep everything, so get the exact best offer I can get that offers things while exceeding by adjusting item 5:\n- Trying all 6 of item 5 to player 2 instead:\n\n  - 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 52 = 208\n  - 7 units of item 2 = 7 \u00d7 62 = 434\n  - 4 units of item 3 = 4 \u00d7 47 = 188\n  - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174\n  - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 57 = 0\n\n   Total value - 208 + 434 + 188 + 174 = 1004\n   \nGetting closer, update only offering 3 units of item 5:\n\n  - 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 52 = 208\n  - 7 units of item 2 = 7 \u00d7 62 = 434\n  - 4 units of item 3 = 4 \u00d7 47 = 188\n  - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174\n  - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171\n\nTotal value = 208 + 434 + 188 + 174 + 171 = 1175\n\nSo keeping 4 units of item 1, 7 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5 is optimal for my value. It exceeds my outside offer, and respects negotiation parameters. Player 2 will receive 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5. \n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis**:\n\nBased on this scenario, I should propose a counteroffer that allows Player 2 to have only 3 units of Item 5, while I keep the rest, since it will maximize my value beyond the alternative outside offer. \n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 3]}",

This means I get 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n    My value for this offer is: (0 * 72) + (0 * 78) + (0 * 26) + (0 * 19) + (3 * 4) = 12.\n    - This value (12) is much lower than my outside offer (543). Accepting this would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\n\nNow, let's consider some potential counteroffers and calculate their values to me. The total amount of each item is [4, 7, 4, 3, 6].\n\n*   **Keep all the items for myself:**\n\n    Value = (4 * 72) + (7 * 78) + (4 * 26) + (3 * 19) + (6 * 4) = 288 + 546 + 104 + 57 + 24 = 1019.\n\n*   **Counteroffer 1: Offer Player 1 nothing ([0, 0, 0, 0, 0]) - Keep everything**\n\n    My value = 1019.\n\n*   **Counteroffer 2: Give Player 1 half of everything (approximately)**\n    Offer Player 1: [2, 3, 2, 1, 3]\n    I keep: [2, 4, 2, 2, 3]\n    My value = (2 * 72) + (4 * 78) + (2 * 26) + (2 * 19) + (3 * 4) = 144 + 312 + 52 + 38 + 12 = 558\n    This value (558) is better than my outside offer (543).\n\n*   **Counteroffer 3: Give Player 1 [0, 0, 4, 0, 6]**\n    I keep: [4, 7, 0, 3, 0]\n    My value = (4 * 72) + (7 * 78) + (0 * 26) + (3 * 19) + (0 * 4) = 288 + 546 + 0 + 57 + 0 = 891\n\n*   **Counteroffer 4: Give Player 1 [4, 7, 4, 3, 6]**\n    I keep: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    My value = (0 * 72) + (0 * 78) + (0 * 26) + (0 * 19) + (0 * 4) = 0\n    This value (0) is less than my outside offer.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1089. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 828 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 7, 3, 3, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    52 x 1 + 62 x 7 + 47 x 3 + 58 x 3 + 57 x 5\n    which is 1086 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1089. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 3, 2, 1, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 3, 2, 1, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

Since we're in round 2, if a deal is accepted in this round, the value for each player is multiplied by 0.98.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n- **Current Offer Value to Me**: \n  - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 52 = 104\n  - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186\n  - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 47 = 94\n  - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 58 = 58\n  - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171\n  - Total value = 104 + 186 + 94 + 58 + 171 = 613\n  - Discounted by 0.98: 613 \u00d7 0.98 = 600.74\n\n- **Comparison to My Outside Offer**:\n  - My discounted value from the current offer is 600.74, which is less than my outside offer of 1089.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n- I should not accept the current offer because the value (600.74) is significantly less than my outside offer (1089).\n- I should not walk away as there may be an opportunity to propose a counteroffer that exceeds my outside offer value.\n\nNow, let's find a potential counteroffer that might be more valuable than my outside offer:\n\nTo achieve a value greater than 1089, ensure you retain item allocations resulting in total calculated values above this threshold. Consider retaining most of the high-value items based on your private valuation.\n\nAs a potential counteroffer, I could propose:\n\n- Offer 0 units of item 1\n- Offer 3 units of item 2\n- Offer 2 units of item 3\n- Offer 1 unit of item 4\n- Offer 1 unit of item 5\n\nRetaining:\n- 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 52 = 208\n- 4 units of item 2 = 4 \u00d7 62 = 248\n- 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 47 = 94\n- 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 58 = 116\n- 5 units of item 5 = 5 \u00d7 57 = 285\n\nTotal retained value = 208 + 248 + 94 + 116 + 285 = 951\n\nIt seems this retained value is also insufficient given the calculations, so I should keep more items.\n\nRe-calculate:\n\nRetain:\n- All 4 units of item 1 = 208\n- All 7 units of item 2 = 434\n- All 4 units of item 3 = 188\n- All 3 units of item 4 = 174\n- 5 units of item 5 = 285\n\nTotal value = 208 + 434 + 188 + 174 + 285 = 1289\n\nAfter retaining these specified units, the proposed offer exceeds my outside offer limit.\n\nLet's finalize the counteroffer that works:\n\n- Offer 0 units of item 1\n- Offer 3 units of item 2\n- Offer 0 units of item 3\n- Offer 0 units of item 4\n- Offer 1 unit of item 5\n\nMy action is to move forward with this valid counteroffer as computed.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 0, 0, 1]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1089. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 828 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 7, 3, 3, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    52 x 1 + 62 x 7 + 47 x 3 + 58 x 3 + 57 x 5\n    which is 1086 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1089. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 3, 2, 1, 3]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 3, 0, 0, 1]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [1, 4, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 4, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To decide the best course of action, let's follow the steps outlined:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n- **Outside Offer Value:** 1089\n- **Values of the Items:** \n  - Item 1: 52\n  - Item 2: 62\n  - Item 3: 47\n  - Item 4: 58\n  - Item 5: 57\n- **Total Pool of Items:**\n  - 4 units of item 1\n  - 7 units of item 2\n  - 4 units of item 3\n  - 3 units of item 4\n  - 6 units of item 5\n- **Discount Factor:** In round 3, \\( \\gamma^{(r-1)} = \\gamma^2 = 0.9604 \\). This affects the value we derive if we accept the current offer, multiplying the total value by 0.9604.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n**Current Offer from Player 2: [1, 4, 1, 1, 1]**\n- Value calculation:\n  - Item 1: \\(1 \\times 52 = 52\\)\n  - Item 2: \\(4 \\times 62 = 248\\)\n  - Item 3: \\(1 \\times 47 = 47\\)\n  - Item 4: \\(1 \\times 58 = 58\\)\n  - Item 5: \\(1 \\times 57 = 57\\)\n- Total value before discounting = \\(52 + 248 + 47 + 58 + 57 = 462\\)\n- Total value after discounting = \\(462 \\times 0.9604 = 443.6556\\)\n\nSince 443.6556 is significantly less than my outside offer of 1089, accepting the current offer is not beneficial.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\n- Accepting the current offer yields a value less than my outside offer, so acceptance is a mistake.\n- Walking away will provide me with my outside offer value of 1089.\n- Proposing a counteroffer this late in the negotiation may result in worse outcomes as Player 2 may choose to walk, but if I do, it must be better than walking away, which in this last round would be treating any counter as a walk if not accepted.\n\nGiven these, my best course of action is to walk away, ensuring I receive my outside offer value.\n\n**Decision:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",
