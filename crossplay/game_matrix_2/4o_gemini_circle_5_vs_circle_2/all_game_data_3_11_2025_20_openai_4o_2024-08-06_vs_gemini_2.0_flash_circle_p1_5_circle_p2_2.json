Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 128. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 128. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 612 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    15 x 0 + 41 x 1 + 23 x 0 + 82 x 0 + 43 x 2\n    which is 127 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 128. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 688. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player1, 2 units of each item (keeping 2 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 759 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 2, 1, 5]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 2, 1, 5]\n\n    What is your action?

Since this is the first round, I have the most leverage. I'll aim for a split that gives me significantly more value than my outside offer, but is still potentially palatable for Player 1. It's important to leave them *something* to avoid a walk-away, especially considering their own private outside offer.\n\nI will offer player 1 the following:\n* Item 1: 1 unit\n* Item 2: 1 unit\n* Item 3: 2 units\n* Item 4: 0 units\n* Item 5: 5 units\n\nThis means I keep:\n* Item 1: 2 units * 26 = 52\n* Item 2: 3 units * 93 = 279\n* Item 3: 4 units * 27 = 108\n* Item 4: 2 units * 98 = 196\n* Item 5: 6 units * 9 = 54\n\nTotal value for me: 52 + 279 + 108 + 196 + 54 = 689\n\nThis value is slightly above my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 2, 0, 5]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 2, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    15 x 0 + 32 x 1 + 94 x 2 + 43 x 1 + 5 x 1\n    which is 268 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 269. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 2, 1, 5]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 2, 0, 5]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 2, 0, 5]\n\n    What is your action?

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 2, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    15 x 0 + 32 x 1 + 94 x 2 + 43 x 1 + 5 x 1\n    which is 268 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 269. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 2, 1, 5]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 2, 0, 5]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 2, 1, 5]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

However, since this is the last round, there won't be another opportunity to accept a better-discounted deal in this framework.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - The current offer on the table is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], which provides me with a total value of \\( (0 \\times 15) + (0 \\times 32) + (0 \\times 94) + (0 \\times 43) + (0 \\times 5) = 0 \\). This is significantly less than my outside offer of 269, so accepting is not viable.\n   - Evaluate potential counteroffers:\n       - My previous round 2 offer was [1, 1, 2, 1, 5]. My value from this offer is:\n         \\[\n         (2 \\times 15) + (3 \\times 32) + (4 \\times 94) + (1 \\times 43) + (6 \\times 5) = 30 + 96 + 376 + 43 + 30 = 575\n         \\]\n       - This value is significantly better than my outside offer, indicating it is a better division for me than walking.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n   - Given that the current offer's value to me is 0 (far below my outside offer of 269), and that my previous counteroffer yields a value of 575 (significantly higher than my outside offer), the best action here is to make a specific counteroffer. I'll aim to propose the same [1, 1, 2, 1, 5] division as it provides a high value to me and doesn't contradict any negotiation strategy rules or mistakes mentioned.\n   - Since Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], it suggests an aggressive stance, making it crucial for me to return to a viable proposal that is better than my fallback option.\n\nConsidering all of these factors, my action will be to make a counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 2, 1, 5]}",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 4, 1, 0, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 4, 1, 0, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the current offer and decide on the best action.\n\nThe current offer gives me:\n* Item 1: 1 unit\n* Item 2: 4 units\n* Item 3: 1 unit\n* Item 4: 0 units\n* Item 5: 2 units\n\nMy values for these items are:\n* Item 1: 13\n* Item 2: 75\n* Item 3: 89\n* Item 4: 33\n* Item 5: 88\n\nSo the value of the current offer to me is:\n(1 * 13) + (4 * 75) + (1 * 89) + (0 * 33) + (2 * 88) = 13 + 300 + 89 + 0 + 176 = 578\n\nSince 578 is less than my outside offer of 851, accepting the current offer is not optimal.\n\nNow, let's consider a counteroffer. Since this is round 1, I want to make a reasonable offer that might lead to a deal, while still getting more than my outside offer after discounting. I have 3 rounds to negotiate, so it is better not to walk in this round.\n\nThe total number of items are 3, 8, 2, 1, 3.\n\nA fair split might be to give player 1 around half of the total value. Let's evaluate the current offer to Player 1:\n* Item 1: 13\n* Item 2: 75\n* Item 3: 89\n* Item 4: 33\n* Item 5: 88\nLet's assume player 1 has similar values to me in their calculation.\nCurrent offer to me: [1, 4, 1, 0, 2]. This means player 1 is getting [2, 4, 1, 1, 1]. I don't know player 1's values, so I cannot determine what Player 1 thinks about their value for the current offer. \n\nI need to counteroffer. I will calculate a counteroffer where I get a value higher than my outside offer.\n\nI will try to get at least half of item 2 and half of item 5, and keep item 3 for myself. This means I will try counteroffering: [2, 4, 1, 1, 1]\nThis means I will be getting 1 unit of item 1 (1 * 13 = 13), 4 units of item 2 (4 * 75 = 300), 1 unit of item 3 (1 * 89 = 89), 0 unit of item 4 (0 * 33 = 0), 2 units of item 5 (2 * 88 = 176).  My total value will be 13 + 300 + 89 + 0 + 176 = 578. This is not enough. I will try to counteroffer less than this.\n\nLet's try to offer [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]. My value would be: 3*13 + 6*75 + 2*89 + 1*33 + 3*88 = 39 + 450 + 178 + 33 + 264 = 964\nNow I need to offer something to player 1. Let's offer [1, 4, 1, 0, 2]. I calculated that I would get a value of 578 which is not acceptable.\nLet's try counteroffer [0, 3, 0, 0, 0]. My value is 39 + 5*75 + 178 + 33 + 264 = 39 + 375 + 178 + 33 + 264 = 889.\nThis is higher than 851.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 1, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    19 x 0 + 19 x 1 + 34 x 1 + 21 x 0 + 35 x 1\n    which is 88 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 89. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 4, 1, 0, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 3, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 3, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the situation:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **Outside Offer Value**: 89.\n- **Values of Items**:\n  - Item 1: 19\n  - Item 2: 19\n  - Item 3: 34\n  - Item 4: 21\n  - Item 5: 35\n- **Total Pool of Items**:\n  - 3 units of item 1\n  - 8 units of item 2\n  - 2 units of item 3\n  - 1 unit of item 4\n  - 3 units of item 5\n- **Discount Factor**: If this negotiation concludes after 2 rounds, the value of the outcome is adjusted by gamma^1 = 0.98.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer**: If I accept the current offer [0, 3, 0, 0, 0], my value would be:\n  - 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 19 = 0\n  - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57\n  - 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 34 = 0\n  - 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 21 = 0\n  - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 35 = 0\n  - Total value to me = 57\n\n  Adjusted for the discount factor (0.98), the effective value = 57 \u00d7 0.98 = 55.86\n\n- **Compare with Outside Offer**: 55.86 is less than 89. Hence, I should not accept the current offer.\n  \n- **Potential Counteroffer Consideration**: I need to propose a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 89.\n\nLet's propose a counteroffer that maximizes my value. I want to ensure my total value is above 89 and that the offer is attractive enough by not being too lopsided. Let's consider keeping a significant portion of high-value items.\n\n### Crafting a Counteroffer\n\nSuppose I keep:\n- 1 unit of item 1 (offer 2 to Player 2)\n- 3 units of item 2 (offer 5 to Player 2)\n- 1 unit of item 3 (offer 1 to Player 2)\n- 0 units of item 4 (offer 1 to Player 2)\n- 1 unit of item 5 (offer 2 to Player 2)\n\n**My Value for this Offer**:\n- 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 19 = 19\n- 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57\n- 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 34 = 34\n- 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 21 = 0\n- 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 35 = 35\n- Total value to me = 19 + 57 + 34 + 0 + 35 = 145\n\nThis value of 145 is well above my outside offer of 89, and the distribution seems fair for negotiation purposes.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nGiven the calculations:\n\n- I should **not** accept the current offer, as its value (55.86) is less than my outside offer (89).\n- I should **not** walk away immediately, as there is room to propose a new offer that could benefit both parties.\n- I should propose a **COUNTEROFFER** as crafted above.\n\nMy action:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 5, 1, 1, 2]}\n```",

I need to make a counteroffer or walk.\n\nLet's analyze the previous offers. In round 1, Player 1 offered [1, 4, 1, 0, 2] and I offered [0, 3, 0, 0, 0]. Player 1's current offer is better than their initial offer for me. It seems like Player 1 is willing to negotiate. I should offer something that gives me more than 851 *after discounting*.\n\nI have:\n*   3 units of item 1\n*   8 units of item 2\n*   2 units of item 3\n*   1 unit of item 4\n*   3 units of item 5\n\nLet's try offering Player 1 something that's closer to their original offer but still potentially beneficial for me. I can try to give them a bit more of item 2 since that seems to be a point of contention (they want 5, I offered 3). I will give them [1, 5, 1, 0, 2].\n\nThis means I would receive:\n\n*   Item 1: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n*   Item 2: 8 - 5 = 3 units\n*   Item 3: 2 - 1 = 1 unit\n*   Item 4: 1 - 0 = 1 unit\n*   Item 5: 3 - 2 = 1 units\n\nMy value:\n\n*   Item 1: 2 * 13 = 26\n*   Item 2: 3 * 75 = 225\n*   Item 3: 1 * 89 = 89\n*   Item 4: 1 * 33 = 33\n*   Item 5: 1 * 88 = 88\n\nTotal value = 26 + 225 + 89 + 33 + 88 = 461\n\nDiscounted value = 461 * 0.98 = 451.78\n\nThis is clearly not a good option. Let's make a counteroffer that gets me closer to my outside offer.\n\nI'm going to try to get most of item 5 since I value it highly, and give more of item 2 to Player 1. Let's offer Player 1 [1, 6, 1, 0, 2]. This gives me [2, 2, 1, 1, 1].\n\nValue to me:\n*   Item 1: 2 * 13 = 26\n*   Item 2: 2 * 75 = 150\n*   Item 3: 1 * 89 = 89\n*   Item 4: 1 * 33 = 33\n*   Item 5: 1 * 88 = 88\n\nTotal: 386. Discounted: 378.28. Still bad.\n\nI need to ask for much more. The current offer gives me 685.02. I need at least 851/0.98 = 868.37 in value.\nLet me try to offer [0, 6, 0, 0, 0]. Then I get 3*13 + 2*75 + 2*89 + 1*33 + 3*88 = 39+150+178+33+264 = 664. 664 * 0.98 = 650.72\n\nLet's try offering [1, 7, 1, 0, 2]. I get [2, 1, 1, 1, 1]. My value: 2*13 + 1*75 + 1*89 + 1*33 + 1*88 = 26 + 75 + 89 + 33 + 88 = 311. Discounted: 304.78. Still no.\n\nOkay, since any reasonable offer that I can make doesn't seem to get close to my outside offer even *before* the discount, I'm going to go for the outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 122. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 798 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 1, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    46 x 0 + 10 x 2 + 100 x 1 + 20 x 0 + 90 x 0\n    which is 120 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 122. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Sure, let's go through the steps to determine the best action:\n\n### 1) Analyze the Current Situation:\n- **Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer value is 122.\n- **Values of the Items**:\n  - Item 1: 6 units available, each worth 46 to me.\n  - Item 2: 7 units available, each worth 10 to me.\n  - Item 3: 4 units available, each worth 100 to me.\n  - Item 4: 0 units available, no value to consider.\n  - Item 5: 3 units available, each worth 90 to me.\n- **Total Value of All Items to Me**: \n  - Item 1: \\(6 \\times 46 = 276\\)\n  - Item 2: \\(7 \\times 10 = 70\\)\n  - Item 3: \\(4 \\times 100 = 400\\)\n  - Item 5: \\(3 \\times 90 = 270\\)\n  - Total = 276 + 70 + 400 + 270 = 1016\n- **Discount Factor**: The value reduces over rounds. After round 1, discount factor is not applied (only kicks in from round 2).\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n- **Current Offer**: No current offer to evaluate.\n- **Potential Counteroffers**: I need to make an initial offer.\n\nTo maximize my value and ensure I don't make Mistake 2 (offering less value to myself than the outside offer of 122), I'll consider counteroffers that ensure I get more than 122. My strategy should aim for a valuation significantly higher, if possible, while being more attractive for Player 2 than walking away.\n\nLet's propose a counteroffer ensuring I retain substantial high-value items (Item 3 and Item 5), given their high value to me, while being moderately flexible on less valuable items (Item 2).\n\n#### Potential Counteroffer:\n- Offer to keep majorly high-value items to myself:\n  - Retain all units of Item 3 (my full value since it's the highest)\n  - Retain all units of Item 5\n  \nI'll give a significant portion of less valued items (from my perspective) to Player 2, but make sure my retained value exceeds 122.\n\n- **Retain**:\n  - Item 1: 3 units (3 x 46 = 138)\n  - Item 2: 4 units (4 x 10 = 40)\n  - Item 3: 4 units (4 x 100 = 400)\n  - Item 5: 2 units (2 x 90 = 180)\n  \n- **Give Away (Counteroffer):**\n  - Item 1: 3 units (3 x 46 = 138 given away)\n  - Item 2: 3 units (3 x 10 = 30 given away)\n  - Item 5: 1 unit (1 x 90 = 90 given away)\n\n**My Value from Retained items** = \\(138 + 40 + 400 + 180 = 758\\).\n\nThis is significantly greater than my outside offer of 122. It\u2019s a fair initial proposal as a starting point for negotiation.\n\n### 3) Decide on Action:\nGiven this analysis and to avoid the mistakes, I will make a counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 3, 0, 0, 1]}\n```\n\nThis offer keeps my retained value significantly higher than my outside offer, thus aligned with my negotiation interests and ensuring I'm not making a less optimal move than my fallback position.",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 401. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player1, 2 units of each item (keeping 2 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 498 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the current offer and decide on the best action for Player 2.\n\nThe current offer on the table is [1, 1, 1, 0, 1], meaning Player 1 is offering me:\n- 1 unit of item 1\n- 1 unit of item 2\n- 1 unit of item 3\n- 0 units of item 4\n- 1 unit of item 5\n\nMy private values are:\n- Item 1: 54\n- Item 2: 4\n- Item 3: 33\n- Item 4: 20\n- Item 5: 55\n\nTherefore, the value of the current offer to me is:\n(1 * 54) + (1 * 4) + (1 * 33) + (0 * 20) + (1 * 55) = 54 + 4 + 33 + 0 + 55 = 146\n\nMy outside offer value is 401. Since the current offer (146) is significantly less than my outside offer, I should not accept it.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. I need to determine a counteroffer that Player 1 might accept, but which is also better than my outside option when considering the discount factor.\nI have a total of 6 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4 and 2 units of item 5.\n\nI am in round 1, thus discount factor is 0.98^(1-1) = 1\n\nSince I'm in round 1, there's no discount factor. The total value to me must exceed my outside offer of 401.\n\nLet's consider a potential split. Since I value item 5 the most at 55 and there are only 2 units, I'll offer none of it to Player 1. I will offer none of Item 4 to Player 1, as I value it at 20.\nMy new calculation for determining a counteroffer goes as follows.\n- Keep Item 5 and Item 4 fully.\n- I will try offering a little bit of Item 1, Item 2 and Item 3.\n\nI'll try offering [3, 1, 2, 0, 0]. The value of this offer to me is:\nRemaining items: 3 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5\nValue = (3 * 54) + (1 * 4) + (2 * 33) + (4 * 20) + (2 * 55)\n= 162 + 4 + 66 + 80 + 110 = 422\n\nThis value (422) is higher than my outside offer (401).\nSo I should make this counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 1, 2, 0, 0]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 2, 0, 3, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    69 x 1 + 7 x 2 + 32 x 0 + 4 x 3 + 57 x 0\n    which is 95 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 96. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 317. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player1, 2 units of each item (keeping 2 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 846 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\nThe current offer on the table is [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]. This means Player 1 is offering me 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n\nMy private values are:\n- Item 1: 9\n- Item 2: 71\n- Item 3: 89\n- Item 4: 45\n- Item 5: 68\n\nTherefore, the value of the current offer to me is:\n(0 * 9) + (0 * 71) + (0 * 89) + (1 * 45) + (1 * 68) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 45 + 68 = 113\n\nMy outside offer is 317. Since 113 < 317, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. I need to determine a counteroffer that Player 1 might accept, and that gives me a value greater than 317.\nI have the following quantities of each item:\n- Item 1: 7\n- Item 2: 4\n- Item 3: 1\n- Item 4: 2\n- Item 5: 5\n\nI want to keep as much of Item 2 and Item 3 as possible, as these have the highest values for me.\n\nLet's aim for a split that gives me at least 317 * 0.98^(1-1) = 317.\n\nI'll try offering Player 1 half of the available items rounding up, except for item 3, of which there is only one unit.\nSo my offer to Player 1 is: [4, 2, 1, 1, 3]\n\nThis leaves me with:\n- Item 1: 3\n- Item 2: 2\n- Item 3: 0\n- Item 4: 1\n- Item 5: 2\n\nThe value of this to me is:\n(3 * 9) + (2 * 71) + (0 * 89) + (1 * 45) + (2 * 68) = 27 + 142 + 0 + 45 + 136 = 350\n\nSince 350 > 317, this offer is better than walking away, if accepted.\n\nNow let's consider offering less to Player 1, such as [3, 1, 0, 0, 2]. This means I keep [4, 3, 1, 2, 3].\nMy value is (4*9)+(3*71)+(1*89)+(2*45)+(3*68) = 36 + 213 + 89 + 90 + 204 = 632\n\nI need to balance the likelihood of acceptance against the value to me. Offering half the items as earlier is a good starting point.\n\nSo, I will make the counteroffer [4, 2, 1, 1, 3].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 2, 1, 1, 3]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 1, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    46 x 0 + 47 x 1 + 3 x 1 + 73 x 0 + 5 x 1\n    which is 55 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 56. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [4, 2, 1, 1, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [4, 2, 1, 1, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 119. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player1, 2 units of each item (keeping 2 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1011 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 1, 4]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the offer and decide on the best course of action.\n\nThe current offer is [0, 0, 0, 1, 4]. This means Player 1 is offering me 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 4 units of item 5.\n\nMy values are:\n- Item 1: 74\n- Item 2: 98\n- Item 3: 68\n- Item 4: 8\n- Item 5: 89\n\nSo, the value of the current offer to me is:\n(0 * 74) + (0 * 98) + (0 * 68) + (1 * 8) + (4 * 89) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 8 + 356 = 364\n\nMy outside offer is 119. Since 364 > 119, accepting the offer is better than walking away *at this stage*. However, we also have to account for the discount factor in later rounds.\n\nLet's consider if making a counteroffer would be better. Given that the negotiation is only 3 rounds, and the discount factor is 0.98, the penalty for delay is small. Player 1's offer only contains Items 4 and 5. I have 3 units of item 4 and 7 units of item 5 in total. I value Items 1 and 2 highly. Item 3 has reasonable value as well.\n\nLet's aim for something closer to an even split to see if we can find an offer that both I and Player 1 would find acceptable. How about offering Player 1 half of the available Items rounded up where there is an uneven number. So I offer them 2 units of Item 1, 1 unit of Item 2, 2 units of Item 3, 2 units of Item 4 and 4 units of Item 5. In return I would keep 2 units of Item 1, 0 units of Item 2, 1 unit of Item 3, 1 unit of Item 4 and 3 units of Item 5.\n\nHowever, since their offer currently provides me with great value, I will accept the current offer since there are limited rounds and a small discount rate.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 2, 3, 6, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    42 x 2 + 36 x 2 + 96 x 3 + 58 x 6 + 52 x 2\n    which is 896 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 900. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

                    "response": "To determine the best course of action, let's go through a step-by-step analysis:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n- **Outside Offer Value**: Our guaranteed fallback value is 900.\n- **Values of the Items**:\n  - Item 1: 42 (per unit)\n  - Item 2: 36 (per unit)\n  - Item 3: 96 (per unit)\n  - Item 4: 58 (per unit)\n  - Item 5: 52 (per unit)\n- **Total Pool of Items**: \n  - 2 units of item 1\n  - 2 units of item 2\n  - 3 units of item 3\n  - 7 units of item 4\n  - 3 units of item 5\n\n- **Discount Factor**: The main impact of the discount factor (gamma = 0.98) is on deciding whether to accept an offer in later rounds, as it lowers the present value of future outcomes.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n- **Current Offer**: There is no current offer on the table.\n  \n- **Potential Counteroffers**:\n  To ensure any counteroffer we make is reasonable, it should have a value to us that is at least 900:\n\n  **Example Offer Calculation**:\n  - Let\u2019s consider offering player 2 a few units of items, ensuring the value retained is more than 900.\n\n  **Our Counteroffer**: Suppose we propose offering:\n  - 0 units of item 1\n  - 0 units of item 2\n  - 0 units of item 3\n  - 2 units of item 4\n  - 0 units of item 5\n\n  **Items Kept by Us**:\n  - 2 units of item 1: 2 x 42 = 84\n  - 2 units of item 2: 2 x 36 = 72\n  - 3 units of item 3: 3 x 96 = 288\n  - 5 units of item 4: 5 x 58 = 290\n  - 3 units of item 5: 3 x 52 = 156\n  \n  **Total Value** = 84 + 72 + 288 + 290 + 156 = 890\n\nThis offer retains a value to us of 890, which is slightly below our outside offer. Therefore, we need to adjust such that we retain more value.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n- **Action**: Since the offer we just calculated is less than the outside offer, we\u2019ll propose a different offer. Let\u2019s adjust to make sure we have a total value above 900.\n\n**New Offer Proposal**:\n- We'll attempt to keep more of item 4, aiming for a value above our outside offer.\n\n- **Modified Counteroffer** (giving away):\n  - 0 units of item 1\n  - 0 units of item 2\n  - 0 units of item 3\n  - 1 unit of item 4\n  - 0 units of item 5\n\n**Items Kept by Us**:\n- 2 units of item 1: 2 x 42 = 84\n- 2 units of item 2: 2 x 36 = 72\n- 3 units of item 3: 3 x 96 = 288\n- 6 units of item 4: 6 x 58 = 348\n- 3 units of item 5: 3 x 52 = 156\n  \n**Total Value** = 84 + 72 + 288 + 348 + 156 = 948\n\nThis offer retains a value to us of 948, which is greater than our outside offer of 900.

Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 2, 3, 6, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    42 x 2 + 36 x 2 + 96 x 3 + 58 x 6 + 52 x 2\n    which is 896 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 900. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 2, 3, 0, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 2, 3, 0, 3]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Let's assess the current situation and analyze the options.\n\n1) Current Situation Analysis:\n   - My outside offer value is 900.\n   - My values for the items are:\n     - Item 1: 42\n     - Item 2: 36\n     - Item 3: 96\n     - Item 4: 58\n     - Item 5: 52\n   - Total pool of items: [2, 2, 3, 7, 3]\n   - The discount factor (gamma) is 0.98, influencing the negotiation value over rounds by reducing the value of future offers slightly compared to immediate acceptance.\n\n2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n   - Current Offer: [2, 2, 3, 0, 3] is being offered to me.\n     - My value if I accept: \n       - Item 1: 2 \u00d7 42 = 84\n       - Item 2: 2 \u00d7 36 = 72\n       - Item 3: 3 \u00d7 96 = 288\n       - Item 4: 0 \u00d7 58 = 0\n       - Item 5: 3 \u00d7 52 = 156\n     - Total value = 84 + 72 + 288 + 0 + 156 = 600\n     - This is much less than my outside offer of 900.\n\n   - Potential Counteroffers:\n     I need to design a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 900.\n\n3) Decision Making:\n   \nSince the current offer gives me a total value of 600, which is significantly less than my outside offer, accepting is not a viable option. I must make a counteroffer that ensures my value exceeds 900, considering the distribution of items.\n\nLet's consider keeping most of the high-value items (item 3 and item 4). \n\nFor example, if I propose keeping:\n- Item 1: 2\n- Item 2: 1\n- Item 3: 2\n- Item 4: 4\n- Item 5: 2\n\nThe resulting offer for Player 2 would be [0, 1, 1, 3, 1]. Let's calculate:\n\n- My value if I keep [2, 1, 2, 4, 2]:\n  - Item 1: 2 \u00d7 42 = 84\n  - Item 2: 1 \u00d7 36 = 36\n  - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 96 = 192\n  - Item 4: 4 \u00d7 58 = 232\n  - Item 5: 2 \u00d7 52 = 104\n- Total value = 84 + 36 + 192 + 232 + 104 = 648\n\nSince this proposed division still doesn't exceed my outside offer of 900, I'll adjust further. I'll try to keep a larger share of the most valuable items. I'll offer [0, 0, 1, 3, 1] to Player 2 and keep [2, 2, 2, 4, 2] for myself.\n\nRecalculating for my keep:\n- My value if I keep [2, 2, 2, 4, 2]:\n  - Item 1: 2 \u00d7 42 = 84\n  - Item 2: 2 \u00d7 36 = 72\n  - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 96 = 192\n  - Item 4: 4 \u00d7 58 = 232\n  - Item 5: 2 \u00d7 52 = 104\n- Total value = 84 + 72 + 192 + 232 + 104 = 684\n\nAdjust again. Offer [0, 0, 0, 2, 0] to offer [2, 2, 3, 5, 3] to myself.\n  - Item 1: 2 \u00d7 42 = 84\n  - Item 2: 2 \u00d7 36 = 72\n  - Item 3: 3 \u00d7 96 = 288\n  - Item 4: 5 \u00d7 58 = 290\n  - Item 5: 3 \u00d7 52 = 156\n- Total value = 84 + 72 + 288 + 290 + 156 = 890\n\nThis still falls short, being just 10 shy; hence, let's go a bit further to avoid the mistakes!\n\nTherefore, my action is to walk away from this negotiation since no reasonable offer reaches my outside offer of 900.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 472. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 472. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 837 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items.

                    "response": "To determine my action, let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n   - **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 472. This is the amount I will receive if the negotiation ends without a deal.\n   \n   - **Values of Items Involved:** \n     - Item 1: 3 per unit\n     - Item 2: 68 per unit\n     - Item 3: 28 per unit\n     - Item 4: 98 per unit\n     - Item 5: 82 per unit\n\n   - **Total Pool of Items:**\n     - 1 unit of item 1\n     - 1 unit of item 2\n     - 0 units of item 3\n     - 2 units of item 4\n     - 4 units of item 5\n\n   - **Discount Factor Influence:** The discount factor \ud835\udefe = 0.98 implies that the value of the deal for all parties is slightly reduced with each passing round. Therefore, finishing the negotiation earlier is slightly better than delaying, provided the offer maintains value above my outside offer.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current Offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n\n   - **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to determine a division of items that provides me with a value greater than my outside offer of 472.\n\n   Let's consider an initial allocation of items where all items are kept by me, and I calculate the total value:\n\n   - Keep [1, 1, 0, 2, 4].\n     - Value of item 1: 3 \u00d7 1 = 3\n     - Value of item 2: 68 \u00d7 1 = 68\n     - Value of item 4: 98 \u00d7 2 = 196\n     - Value of item 5: 82 \u00d7 4 = 328\n     - Total value = 3 + 68 + 196 + 328 = 595\n\n   Now, let's find an allocation that is greater than 472 but still potentially acceptable.\n\n   Try giving:\n   - Offer [1, 1, 0, 0, 1] units to Player 2, and calculate the value for me:\n     - I keep [0, 0, 0, 2, 3].\n     - Value of item 4: 98 \u00d7 2 = 196\n     - Value of item 5: 82 \u00d7 3 = 246\n     - Total value = 196 + 246 = 442\n\n   This offer is less than my outside offer, so I need to retain more value:\n\n   Offer [1, 1, 0, 1, 2] units to Player 2:\n   - I keep [0, 0, 0, 1, 2].\n     - Value of item 4: 98 \u00d7 1 = 98\n     - Value of item 5: 82 \u00d7 2 = 164\n     - Total value = 98 + 164 = 262\n   \n   This is also less than my outside offer.

Let's try a less generous offer:\n\n   Offer [1, 1, 0, 1, 1]:\n   - I keep [0, 0, 0, 1, 3].\n     - Value of item 4: 98 \u00d7 1 = 98\n     - Value of item 5: 82 \u00d7 3 = 246\n     - Total value = 98 + 246 = 344\n   \n   This is still less than my outside offer. Let's try another:\n\n   Offer [1, 0, 0, 1, 1]:\n   - I keep [0, 1, 0, 1, 3]:\n     - Value of item 2: 68 \u00d7 1 = 68\n     - Value of item 4: 98 \u00d7 1 = 98\n     - Value of item 5: 82 \u00d7 3 = 246\n     - Total value = 68 + 98 + 246 = 412\n   \n   This is still less than my outside offer.\n\n   Offer [0, 1, 0, 0, 2]:\n   - I keep [1, 0, 0, 2, 2]:\n      - Value of item 1: 3 \u00d7 1 = 3\n      - Value of item 4: 98 \u00d7 2 = 196\n      - Value of item 5: 82 \u00d7 2 = 164\n      - Total value = 3 + 196 + 164 = 363\n      \n   This is still less than my outside offer. Let's try another:\n\n   Offer [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]:\n   - I keep [1, 1, 0, 1, 4]:\n     - Value of item 1: 3 \u00d7 1 = 3\n     - Value of item 2: 68 \u00d7 1 = 68\n     - Value of item 4: 98 \u00d7 1 = 98\n     - Value of item 5: 82 \u00d7 4 = 328\n     - Total value = 3 + 68 + 98 + 328 = 497\n\n3) **Making a Decision:**\n\nGiven the initial allocation and proposed offers, my maximum value via offering [0, 0, 0, 1, 0], results in me keeping [1, 1, 0, 1, 4], which provides me with a total value of 497. This value (after accounting for the discount factor if necessary) is higher than my outside offer of 472.\n\nTherefore, I will propose the following counteroffer:\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]}",

The value to me is:\n(0.75 * 1) + (0.75 * 20) + (0 * 37) + (1.75 * 71) + (3 * 59) = 0.75 + 15 + 0 + 124.25 + 177 = 317\n\nLet's try this: offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 2] to Player 1. Then I keep [1, 1, 0, 2, 2]. Value to me is (1*1) + (1*20) + (0*37) + (2*71) + (2*59) = 1 + 20 + 0 + 142 + 118 = 281. Still higher than outside offer.\nLet's offer the counteroffer: [0, 0, 0, 1, 0] back to player 1. This means I get to keep: [1, 1, 0, 1, 4]. Value to me: (1*1) + (1*20) + (0*37) + (1*71) + (4*59) = 1 + 20 + 0 + 71 + 236 = 328\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 0, 2, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 72. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1029 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 0, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    46 x 1 + 97 x 0 + 84 x 0 + 91 x 0 + 25 x 1\n    which is 71 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 72. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

The discount factor reduces the future value of a deal as rounds progress, emphasizing the importance of reaching an agreement sooner.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - There's currently no offer on the table.\n   - For any counteroffer I propose, I need to calculate its total value to ensure it's greater than my outside offer (72).\n   - Potential division examples to evaluate:\n     - Keeping more items than giving away to ensure I exceed my outside offer value.\n\n3) **Calculate potential offers:**\n   - If I keep 4 units of Item 1, 0 of Item 2, 0 of Item 3, 0 of Item 4, 2 units of Item 5:\n     - Value = 4 \u00d7 46 + 0 \u00d7 97 + 0 \u00d7 84 + 0 \u00d7 91 + 2 \u00d7 25 = 184 + 50 = 234.\n   - This value (234) is significantly greater than my outside offer (72), indicating a high value to me.\n   - However, this might not be attractive to Player 2, as they would receive very little.\n\n4) **Make a decision:**\n\nBased on this analysis, I intend to make a fairer initial offer to increase the chance of a mutual agreement and take advantage of the discount factor by settling sooner rather than later. I will aim to keep a reasonable amount of items that still exceed my outside offer value but is more balanced:\n\n- Keep 2 units of Item 1, 2 of Item 2, 2 of Item 3, 0 of Item 4, and 1 of Item 5:\n  - Value to me = 2 \u00d7 46 + 2 \u00d7 97 + 2 \u00d7 84 + 0 \u00d7 91 + 1 \u00d7 25 = 92 + 194 + 168 + 0 + 25 = 479.\n- This value (479) is still well above my outside offer, and offers a substantially fair division of items to Player 2 as well.\n\n**Proposed action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 2, 0, 1]}\n```",

Thus, I will calculate different potential distributions that maximize my value.\n\n#### Let's consider keeping the following units for myself and offering the rest to Player 2:\n\n- Tentative allocation: [2, 0, 5, 1, 3] (these are the units Player 2 would receive of each item)\n- This means I would keep: [2, 1, 2, 2, 2]\n\nNow, calculate the value to me of keeping this allocation:\n- 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 76 = 152\n- 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 76 = 76\n- 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 2 = 4\n- 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 19 = 38\n- 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 44 = 88\n- Total value to me = 152 + 76 + 4 + 38 + 88 = 358\n\nChecking this proposal against the outside offer:\n- My outside offer is 397, and the value of my allocation is 358, which is less than the outside offer.\n\nLet's adjust the items for a potentially better outcome:\n\n#### Second option:\n- Tentative allocation: [1, 0, 5, 1, 3] (give 1 item 1 unit to Player 2)\n- Allocation I keep: [3, 1, 2, 2, 2]\n\nNow, calculate the value to me:\n- 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228\n- 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 76 = 76\n- 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 2 = 4\n- 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 19 = 38\n- 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 44 = 88\n- Total value to me = 228 + 76 + 4 + 38 + 88 = 434\n\nThis allocation gives me a value of 434, which is higher than my outside offer of 397.\n\n### 3) Make a decision:\nGiven these calculations, the second counteroffer ([1, 0, 5, 1, 3]) gives me a better value than my outside offer.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 2, 2, 1, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    8 x 1 + 6 x 2 + 99 x 2 + 26 x 1 + 54 x 2\n    which is 352 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 353. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 2, 2, 1, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    8 x 1 + 6 x 2 + 99 x 2 + 26 x 1 + 54 x 2\n    which is 352 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 353. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 5, 2, 0, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 1, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 1, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 208. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player1, 2 units of each item (keeping 2 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 783 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

I need to decide between walking away and making a counteroffer.\n\nIf I walk away, I get 208.\n\nTo consider a counteroffer, I need to determine what would be a reasonable split, keeping in mind Player 1's potential values (which I don't know) and the discount factor in later rounds. Since this is round 1, I'm not overly concerned about the discount factor yet, but it is important to calculate the maximum possible value.\n\nMy total value for all items is 1192. To beat my walk away offer of 208, the counteroffer has to make me at least this much value.\n\nLet's try to construct a counteroffer that is significantly better than walking away. A potential strategy is to aim for a split where I get the majority of the items, especially those I value highly. Let's start by allocating most of item 5 (my highest value) to myself.\n\nCounteroffer: I will offer Player 1: [2, 0, 2, 2, 0]\nThis means I keep:\n- Item 1: 7 - 2 = 5\n- Item 2: 2 - 0 = 2\n- Item 3: 6 - 2 = 4\n- Item 4: 6 - 2 = 4\n- Item 5: 5 - 0 = 5\n\nValue of counteroffer to me:\n(5 * 9) + (2 * 73) + (4 * 56) + (4 * 32) + (5 * 91) = 45 + 146 + 224 + 128 + 455 = 998\n\nSince 998 > 208, and it is the first round, this offer seems quite good.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 5, 5, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    53 x 1 + 96 x 1 + 2 x 5 + 79 x 5 + 80 x 5\n    which is 954 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 955. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 0, 2, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 0, 2, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To determine the best action, let's walk through the given step-by-step process:\n\n### 1) Analyze the Current Situation:\n\n- **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer is 955.\n  \n- **Value of Items to Me:**\n  - Item 1: Value per unit = 53\n  - Item 2: Value per unit = 96\n  - Item 3: Value per unit = 2\n  - Item 4: Value per unit = 79\n  - Item 5: Value per unit = 80\n  \n- **Total Pool of Items:**\n  - 7 units of Item 1\n  - 2 units of Item 2\n  - 6 units of Item 3\n  - 6 units of Item 4\n  - 5 units of Item 5\n  \n- **Discount Factor Influence:** \n  - The discount factor \\( \\gamma = 0.98 \\) influences the negotiation by reducing the value of outcomes as more rounds are played. If we reach the third round, the value of the outcome would be multiplied by \\( \\gamma^{1} = 0.98 \\).\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n\n- **Current Offer on the Table:** [2, 0, 2, 2, 0] (what Player 2 is offering me)\n  - My Value if I accept it:\n    - Item 1: 2 units \u00d7 53 = 106\n    - Item 2: 0 units \u00d7 96 = 0\n    - Item 3: 2 units \u00d7 2 = 4\n    - Item 4: 2 units \u00d7 79 = 158\n    - Item 5: 0 units \u00d7 80 = 0\n  - Total Value = 268\n\n  - **Adjusted for Discount Factor:** 268 \u00d7 \\( \\gamma = 0.98 \\) = 262.64\n\n- **Comparison to Outside Offer:** \n  - My outside offer is 955. Since 262.64 is substantially lower than 955, accepting is not viable.\n\n- **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to propose a division where my total value exceeds 955. Let's evaluate a few potential divisions:\n\n  - **Example Counteroffer:** [1, 0, 1, 0, 0] (what I give to Player 2, meaning I keep [6, 2, 5, 6, 5])\n    - My Value if I keep [6, 2, 5, 6, 5]:\n      - Item 1: 6 units \u00d7 53 = 318\n      - Item 2: 2 units \u00d7 96 = 192\n      - Item 3: 5 units \u00d7 2 = 10\n      - Item 4: 6 units \u00d7 79 = 474\n      - Item 5: 5 units \u00d7 80 = 400\n    - Total Value = 1394, which is higher than 955.\n\n### 3) Decision Making:\n\n- **Accept Current Offer?** No, the value is much less than my outside offer.\n  \n- **Walk Away?** Not yet, as there's potential to make a counteroffer that exceeds my outside offer.\n  \n- **Propose a Counteroffer:** I should propose [1, 0, 1, 0, 0] as a counteroffer, where I give Player 2 those items and retain a high total value for myself.\n\nTherefore, the action is to make a counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]}\n```",

This means I get 1 unit of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5. My valuation of this offer is:\n(1 * 9) + (0 * 73) + (1 * 56) + (0 * 32) + (0 * 91) = 9 + 0 + 56 + 0 + 0 = 65.\n\nSince this is round 2, I need to discount this value by gamma^(2-1) = 0.98^1 = 0.98. So, the present value of accepting this offer is 65 * 0.98 = 63.7.\n\nMy outside offer is 208.\n\nTherefore, accepting the current offer (even discounted) is significantly worse than walking away and taking my outside offer. Now I need to consider if I should counteroffer. If I counteroffer in round 2, and we don't reach an agreement, I get my outside offer.\n\nLet's consider making a counteroffer that is barely acceptable to Player 1. I don't know Player 1's values, so this is hard. But in round 3, they will have a similar calculation. Let's first consider if I make the most generous counteroffer. I have 7 items of type 1, 2 of type 2, 6 of type 3, 6 of type 4, and 5 of type 5. My values are 9, 73, 56, 32, 91 respectively.\nTotal value of all items = 7*9 + 2*73 + 6*56 + 6*32 + 5*91 = 63 + 146 + 336 + 192 + 455 = 1192.\n\nMy current value is 65. If I walk away, I get 208.\n\nIf I want player 1 to accept a counteroffer, it must be better than their outside option, which is unknown. My goal is to get as close to 1192 as possible.\n\nLet's offer player 1 the amounts they are currently asking for, but try to get some of the other items. The current offer *to me* is [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]. Therefore the current offer *from me* is [6, 2, 5, 6, 5]. This would give me only the offered amount (65).\n\nOkay, since I don't know Player 1's values, and any counteroffer gives them some surplus, and it's only round 2, my best move is to try to extract as much value as possible. I will offer them a little more than the previous accepted amount from Round 1 ([1, 1, 1, 1, 0]). Let's try offering them exactly that amount.\n\nIf I offer [1, 1, 1, 1, 0], then I get [6, 1, 5, 5, 5]. My value is:\n(6 * 9) + (1 * 73) + (5 * 56) + (5 * 32) + (5 * 91) = 54 + 73 + 280 + 160 + 455 = 1022.\nDiscounted value = 1022 * 0.98 = 1001.56 > 208.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 5, 5, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    53 x 1 + 96 x 1 + 2 x 5 + 79 x 5 + 80 x 5\n    which is 954 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 955. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 0, 2, 2, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 212. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 849 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 1, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    48 x 0 + 96 x 1 + 36 x 0 + 99 x 1 + 4 x 4\n    which is 211 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 212. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 0, 0, 3, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 0, 0, 3, 3]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",

Let's follow the step-by-step process.\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value: 212\n   - My values for the items involved:\n     - Item 1: 48 per unit\n     - Item 2: 96 per unit\n     - Item 3: 36 per unit\n     - Item 4: 99 per unit\n     - Item 5: 4 per unit\n   - Total pool of items:\n     - 3 units of item 1\n     - 3 units of item 2\n     - 1 unit of item 3\n     - 5 units of item 4\n     - 6 units of item 5\n   - Discount factor: The value of accepting an offer declines with each round due to the discount factor (gamma = 0.98).\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer: [2, 0, 0, 3, 3]\n     - My value for this distribution:\n       - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 48 = 96\n       - 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 96 = 0\n       - 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 36 = 0\n       - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297\n       - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12\n     - Total value = 96 + 0 + 0 + 297 + 12 = 405\n\n   Since it's round 2, this offer is subject to a discount factor. Therefore, the present value of the offer is 405 * (0.98)^1 = 396.9\n\n   - My outside offer value: 212, which is less than 396.9.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - The discounted value of the current offer (396.9) is greater than my outside offer value (212).\n   - Accepting the current offer is better than my outside offer and ensures I receive more value.\n\nHence, considering the analysis, the optimal action would be to accept the current offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

However, before accepting, let's consider a potential counteroffer to see if we can get an even better deal.\n\nThe total number of items are: 4 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 5 of item 3, 4 of item 4, and 3 of item 5. If Player 1 is giving me [1, 0, 1, 0, 1], they are keeping [3, 4, 4, 4, 2].\n\nI want to maximize my value. Item 5 is my most valuable item (77) followed by item 4 (49). Item 3 is my least valuable (4). I should consider making a counteroffer that gives Player 1 more of item 3.\n\nA reasonable counteroffer would be to give Player 1 [3, 3, 5, 3, 0]. This means I would get:\n* Item 1: 1 unit\n* Item 2: 1 unit\n* Item 3: 0 unit\n* Item 4: 1 units\n* Item 5: 3 unit\n\nThe value of this to me would be:\n(1 * 6) + (1 * 5) + (0 * 4) + (1 * 49) + (3 * 77) = 6 + 5 + 0 + 49 + 231 = 291\n\nSince this is much more than my current offer (87) and the outside option (78), let's make that counteroffer.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

I don't have that information, so I will make an offer that is likely to give me a good value but also leaves room for Player 1 to benefit.\n\nI will make an offer where Player 1 receives some of everything, while ensuring I keep items that I value most.\n\nMy counteroffer: I will offer Player 1 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4 and 0 unit of item 5. This leaves me with 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4 and 3 units of item 5.\n\nValue of my counteroffer to me:\n(4 * 18) + (3 * 45) + (1 * 90) + (3 * 59) + (3 * 79) = 72 + 135 + 90 + 177 + 237 = 711\n\nWhile this is below my outside offer, remember this calculation doesn't take into account any possible further round. Making this counteroffer keeps negotiation alive, which can be good. I will make a slightly more favorable counteroffer, so the value calculation becomes:\n(3 * 18) + (2 * 45) + (1 * 90) + (2 * 59) + (3 * 79) = 54 + 90 + 90 + 118 + 237 = 589\nOffer Player 1: 5 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4 and 0 units of item 5.\nValue of my counteroffer to me:\n(3 * 18) + (2 * 45) + (1 * 90) + (2 * 59) + (3 * 79) = 54 + 90 + 90 + 118 + 237 = 589. This is still a bit low, so I will add a tiny bit from my best item.\nOffer Player 1: 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4 and 0 units of item 5.\nValue of my counteroffer to me:\n(4 * 18) + (3 * 45) + (1 * 90) + (3 * 59) + (3 * 79) = 72 + 135 + 90 + 177 + 237 = 711\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 3, 0, 3, 0]}\n",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1594. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1062 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 6, 1, 6, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    63 x 5 + 97 x 6 + 94 x 1 + 98 x 6 + 2 x 3\n    which is 1585 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1594. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [4, 3, 0, 3, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [4, 3, 0, 3, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

No counteroffer can be created that would be reasonable in this final round and match or exceed my outside offer with what I've calculated. \n\nHence, my action:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 3, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    10 x 4 + 7 x 3 + 13 x 0 + 35 x 0 + 33 x 0\n    which is 61 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 62. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To determine the best initial offer, I need to carefully evaluate the situation, our negotiation constraints, and my objectives. Here\u2019s a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n\n   - **My outside offer value**: It is 62. This is the minimum acceptable value for any outcome.\n   - **Values of items**:\n     - Item 1: 10 per unit\n     - Item 2: 7 per unit\n     - Item 3: 13 per unit\n     - Item 4: 35 per unit\n     - Item 5: 33 per unit\n   - **Total pool of items**: \n     - 5 units of item 1\n     - 3 units of item 2\n     - 1 unit of item 3\n     - 4 units of item 4\n     - 4 units of item 5\n   - **Discount factor**: This influences negotiations by decreasing the present value of future offers due to the factor (gamma = 0.98). On first round, this is not a concern because it doesn't impact initial offers directly.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n\n   - **Current offer**: None, as nothing is currently being offered.\n   - **Potential counteroffers**: I need to consider an offer that has a value greater than 62 to account for my outside offer being the guaranteed fallback.\n\n   Let's evaluate a potential offer:\n   Suppose I offer 4 units of each item to Player 2.\n   - I keep 1 unit of item 1 (value = 10 x 1 = 10)\n   - I keep 0 units of item 2 (value = 7 x 0 = 0)\n   - I keep 0 units of item 3 (value = 13 x 0 = 0)\n   - I keep 0 units of item 4 (value = 35 x 0 = 0)\n   - I keep 0 units of item 5 (value = 33 x 0 = 0)\n\n   Total value I keep = 10.\n\n   Since this value (10) is worse than my outside offer (62), I need to keep more items.\n\n   After further calculation, choosing to keep items strategically:\n\n   - I keep 2 items of item 4 and 2 of item 5. As follows:\n     - Item 1: 0 (0 value)\n     - Item 2: 0 (0 value)\n     - Item 3: 0 (0 value)\n     - Item 4: 2 units (2 x 35 = 70 value)\n     - Item 5: 2 units (2 x 33 = 66 value)\n\n   My total value = 70 + 66 = 136, which is better than 62.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n\n   - Since the value from keeping 2 units of items 4 and 5 (136) is greater than my outside offer (62), I will make the initial offer reflecting this allocation.\n\nThus, I should propose a counteroffer where Player 2 gets [5, 3, 1, 2, 2] and I keep [0, 0, 0, 2, 2].\n\nHere is my action:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [5, 3, 1, 2, 2]}\n```",

This implies that it is generally better to conclude a negotiation sooner rather than later, provided the offer is favorable.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** There is no current offer from Player 2.\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** I need to create an initial offer that ensures my outcome is better than my outside offer value of 67. Let's explore a division where I aim to keep items that maximize my value.\n\n   Let's consider different potential divisions:\n\n   **Offer 1:**\n   - Keep: [3, 0, 0, 0, 0] \n   - My value: 3\u00d761 = 183\n\n   **Offer 2:**\n   - Keep: [2, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n   - My value: 2\u00d761 + 1\u00d753 = 175\n\n   **Offer 3:**\n   - Keep: [2, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n   - My value: 2\u00d761 + 1\u00d762 = 184\n\n   **Offer 4:**\n   - Keep: [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]\n   - My value: 1\u00d761 + 1\u00d753 + 1\u00d762 = 176\n\n   **Offer 5:**\n   - Keep: [1, 0, 1, 2, 0]\n   - My value: 1\u00d761 + 1\u00d762 + 2\u00d72 = 127\n\n   Clearly, from the examples above, any offer where I keep more high-value items relative to my valuation results in a value significantly higher than my outside offer value of 67.\n\n   I will opt for Offer 3 as my counteroffer, which gives me a value of 184.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - I will propose my counteroffer as it provides a high value to me, and I still have the potential to negotiate for higher or accept better offers in subsequent rounds.\n   - Offer 3 means I propose to give Player 2 [1, 2, 0, 5, 4].\n\nBased on the analysis, the action I will take is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 0, 5, 4]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 4, 4, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    36 x 2 + 100 x 4 + 28 x 4 + 26 x 1 + 66 x 3\n    which is 808 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 817. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

The goal is to have a total value greater than 817 to justify not walking away.\n     - Calculate the total value of keeping most of the high-value items and offering a reasonable distribution to Player 2:\n     \n       Let's propose keeping most of the high-value items for myself:\n       - Keeping: [0, 3, 3, 2, 2] (offering 2 item 1, 1 item 2, 1 item 3, 1 item 4, 1 item 5)\n       - Offer to Player 2: [2, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n       Calculate my total value:\n       - 0 \u00d7 36 + 3 \u00d7 100 + 3 \u00d7 28 + 2 \u00d7 26 + 2 \u00d7 66\n       - = 0 + 300 + 84 + 52 + 132\n       - = 568\n\n     - Clearly, this proposed allocation is less than my outside offer value of 817. Therefore, I need to adjust it as my expected value should be at least 817.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   Since my initial calculation of retaining more significant value is less than my outside offer, I should provide a fair allocation, adjusting to ensure my retained value is at least equal to 817. I will start somewhere closer to my threshold of 817 to account for negotiation rounds and avoid early concession. Not providing a counteroffer will count as a walk.\n\n   I will adjust the allocation:\n   - Offer to retain more of higher valued items of 2, reducing items that bring low overall benefit.\n\n   New allocation:\n   - Keeping: [1, 3, 4, 0, 0] \n   - Offer to Player 2: [1, 1, 0, 3, 3]\n\n    The value for me would be:\n    - 1 x 36 + 3 x 100 + 4 x 28 + 0 x 26 + 0 x 66\n    - = 36 + 300 + 112 + 0 + 0\n    - = 448, still below my outside offer.\n\n   Final decision is to either provide a strategic counter offer or walk away for guaranteed value.\n\n   I'll refine and propose:\n   Keeping: [2, 3, 4, 1, 0]\n   \n   Offer Calculation:\n   - Offer to Player 2: [0, 1, 0, 2, 3]\n     - 2 x 36 + 3 x 100 + 4 x 28 + 1 x 26 + 0 x 66 = 72 + 300 + 112 + 26 + 0\n     - This gives me a cumulative value of 510, which doesn\u2019t meet my threshold.\n\n   Based on insights, considering 0s offers lower value culminating within strategy as well as the chance of Player 2 rejection.\n\n   **Proposing offer again**:\n   - Optimal allocation needs iteration, careful allocation could enable fruitful negotiation rounds. If, however, unable, reconsider negotiating strategy or external fallback.\n\n   **Therefore: the most logical choice, given previous calculations might need refinement**, allocate while mindful of quantifying overall gain.\n\nLet's format an offer for consideration:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 1, 2, 3]}\n```\n\nThis allocation should prioritize maintaining significant value and fostering groundwork toward a mutually beneficial deal progression strategy within foreseeable rounds.

I want to make an offer that is better than my outside offer, but also leaves Player 1 with something worthwhile to avoid a walk.\n\nLet's start by offering Player 1 half of each item, and adjusting the offer from there.\n* Item 1: 1 unit\n* Item 2: 2 units\n* Item 3: 2 units\n* Item 4: 1 unit\n* Item 5: 1 unit\n\nThis leaves me with:\n* Item 1: 1 unit\n* Item 2: 2 units\n* Item 3: 2 units\n* Item 4: 2 units\n* Item 5: 2 units\n\nMy value for this is:\n* Item 1: 1 * 35 = 35\n* Item 2: 2 * 6 = 12\n* Item 3: 2 * 99 = 198\n* Item 4: 2 * 40 = 80\n* Item 5: 2 * 84 = 168\nTotal value = 35 + 12 + 198 + 80 + 168 = 493\n\nThis is still far from my outside offer value.\n\nLet's try offering Player 1 the minimum amount of items while still exceeding my outside offer:\nOffer Player 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nThis leaves me with all the items for a total value of 862.\n\nSince I have the opportunity to counteroffer I will make this offer to Player 1.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

                    "prompt": "\n    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\n    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\n    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\n    There are 2 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\n    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\n    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 101.\n    Your private values are 36 for item 1, 100 for item 2, 28 for item 3, 26 for item 4, 66 for item 5.\n    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to your total value of all items, which is 860. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 817. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 817. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 768 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 4, 4, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    36 x 2 + 100 x 4 + 28 x 4 + 26 x 1 + 66 x 3\n    which is 808 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 817. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 1, 2, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To analyze the current situation, let's answer the questions step by step:\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 817.\n   - The values of the items involved for me are: \n     - Item 1: 36\n     - Item 2: 100\n     - Item 3: 28\n     - Item 4: 26\n     - Item 5: 66\n   - The total pool of items is:\n     - Item 1: 2 units\n     - Item 2: 4 units\n     - Item 3: 4 units\n     - Item 4: 3 units\n     - Item 5: 3 units\n   - The discount factor (gamma) influences the value of accepting an offer now versus later by reducing the value by 2% each round. In round 2, the discount factor is 0.98^1 = 0.98.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer to me is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], which gives me a total value of 0.\n   - My previous offer (what I proposed to keep) was [2, 3, 3, 1, 0]. Let\u2019s calculate the value to me if I make this the counteroffer:\n     - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 36 = 72\n     - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300\n     - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 28 = 84\n     - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 26 = 26\n     - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 66 = 0\n     - Total value = 72 + 300 + 84 + 26 + 0 = 482\n     - Applying the discount factor from round 2: 482 \u00d7 0.98 = 472.36\n   - This value (472.36) is less than my outside offer value of 817.\n\nTo prevent mistakes:\n- I should not accept the current offer since it has a value of 0, which is worse than my outside offer.\n- I should not make a counteroffer that leaves me with a value lower than 817.\n- Accepting or counteroffering for less than my outside offer is suboptimal.\n\n3) Make a decision:\n- Accepting the current offer isn't an option because it yields no value.\n- My previous offer doesn\u2019t work as a counteroffer because it results in a value lower than 817.\n- Walking away ensures I get my outside offer value, which is the best option given these circumstances.\n\nTherefore, to avoid mistakes and ensure my objective of maximizing value, the appropriate action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",
