If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 2, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    85 x 0 + 21 x 0 + 1 x 1 + 79 x 2 + 25 x 6\n    which is 309 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 310. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

However, since it's the first round, the discount does not yet apply.\n\n### Step 2: Assess Potential Offers\n\n#### Consider Full Value of Keeping All Items\n- If I keep all items, the total value to me would be:\n  \\[\n  (4 \\times 85) + (3 \\times 21) + (6 \\times 1) + (5 \\times 79) + (9 \\times 25) = 340 + 63 + 6 + 395 + 225 = 1029\n  \\]\n  This is greater than my outside offer, so an offer yielding a value less than 1029 but more than 310 is what I'm seeking.\n\n#### Objective: Propose a Counteroffer\nI need to propose a split where the value of what I keep is at least better than my outside offer of 310.\n\nLet's try some potential divisions, ensuring what I keep exceeds my outside offer:\n\n1. **Offer: [4, 3, 6, 0, 0]**\n   - **Keep**: 0 units of item 1, 0 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 5 of item 4, 9 of item 5\n   - **Value to me**: \\( (0 \\times 85) + (0 \\times 21) + (0 \\times 1) + (5 \\times 79) + (9 \\times 25) \\)\n   - \\[ = 0 + 0 + 0 + 395 + 225 = 620 \\]\n   - This keeps more value for me than my outside offer.\n\nBy analyzing this division, I am offering Player 2 items they might potentially value more than I do while keeping high-value items (based on my evaluation) for myself.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\nSince I am Player 1 in round 1, and there's no penalty for making the first offer, I should propose a counteroffer that exceeds the value of my outside offer, while aiming that it may be acceptable for Player 2.\n\nMy initial offer aims to maintain value well above my outside fallback and offers Player 2 a fair portion of the items.\n\n### Final Action\nMy action, given these considerations, will be to propose the following counteroffer:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 3, 6, 0, 0]}\n```",

The value of accepting an offer decreases by the discount factor raised to the power of the number of rounds minus one.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 4, 1, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    11 x 0 + 90 x 3 + 39 x 4 + 6 x 1 + 30 x 4\n    which is 552 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 553. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values.

In round 2 or later, the effective value of the outcome to us is multiplied by gamma raised to the power of (round-1). Therefore, it\u2019s best to conclude earlier if a favorable outcome can be reached.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n   - **Current Offer:** Currently, no offer is on the table, as I'm the first to propose.\n   - **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to propose a division of items that gives me a total value greater than my outside offer of 553.\n\n   Let\u2019s calculate and propose some potential allocations:\n\n   Example Counteroffer:\n   - Offering [0, 0, 2, 0, 4] (i.e., keeping 2 units of item 3 and 1 unit of item 5):\n     - My value = (2 \u00d7 39) + (1 \u00d7 30) = 78 + 30 = 108\n\n   This doesn't satisfy my outside offer condition. Let's consider a larger allocation that values items according to my priorities:\n\n   - Offering [0, 0, 0, 0, 3], keeping [2, 3, 5, 2, 2] (i.e., giving 3 units of item 5, rest all to me):\n     - My value = (2 \u00d7 11) + (3 \u00d7 90) + (5 \u00d7 39) + (2 \u00d7 6) + (2 \u00d7 30)\n     - Calculating My value:\n       - Item 1: 22\n       - Item 2: 270\n       - Item 3: 195\n       - Item 4: 12\n       - Item 5: 60\n     - Total Value: 559\n\n   The above distribution gives me a total value of 559, which is greater than my outside offer of 553.\n\n3) **Make a Decision:**\n   - Since my calculated offer of keeping [2, 3, 5, 2, 2] achieves a value greater than my outside offer (559 > 553), I will proceed with this offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 3]}",

Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 4, 1, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    11 x 0 + 90 x 3 + 39 x 4 + 6 x 1 + 30 x 4\n    which is 552 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 553. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 3, 0, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 3, 0, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

Since we're currently in round 2, if the negotiation extends to round 3, the effective value of any deal would be less due to the power of the discount factor.\n\n### 2) Assess the value of offers:\n\n- **Current offer (your portion):** [0, 0, 5, 1, 3]\n  - 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 11 = 0\n  - 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 90 = 0\n  - 5 units of item 3 = 5 \u00d7 39 = 195\n  - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 6 = 6\n  - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 30 = 90\n  - Total value = 291\n\nComparing 291 to my outside offer (553), the current offer is significantly worse.\n\n- **Potential counteroffer:** \n  - If I keep 1 unit of item 2, 5 units of item 3, and 5 units of item 5, offering [2, 2, 0, 2, 0], my value would be:\n    - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 11 = 22\n    - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 90 = 90\n    - 5 units of item 3 = 5 \u00d7 39 = 195\n    - 0 unit of item 4 = 0\n    - 5 units of item 5 = 5 \u00d7 30 = 150\n    - Total value = 457\n\nEven with this counteroffer, the value is still less than my outside offer of 553.\n\n### 3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n\n- **Accept the current offer?** No, since the value (291) is less than my outside offer (553).\n- **Walk away and take my outside offer?** It's a guaranteed value that's significantly higher than the current offer or any feasible offer I could make without any further information about Player 2's values.\n- **Propose a specific counteroffer?** Any counteroffer must surpass 553 in total value. However, keeping more highly valued items like item 2 does not provide enough value beyond 553 without knowing Player 2's item preferences.\n\nGiven this, I must make a prudent choice to secure payoff without taking unnecessary risks.\n\n### Decision:\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 179. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 663 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 4, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    50 x 0 + 50 x 0 + 100 x 1 + 18 x 4 + 3 x 2\n    which is 178 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 179. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 4, 1, 1, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 8, 0, 6, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 0, 4, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 0, 4, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Let's analyze the current situation step by step:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - **Outside offer value:** My outside offer value is 1035.\n   - **Values of the items involved:**\n     - Item 1: 100 per unit\n     - Item 2: 7 per unit\n     - Item 3: 80 per unit\n     - Item 4: 17 per unit\n     - Item 5: 80 per unit\n   - **Total pool of items:**\n     - 5 units of item 1\n     - 8 units of item 2\n     - 2 units of item 3\n     - 6 units of item 4\n     - 4 units of item 5\n   - **Discount factor:** Gamma = 0.98. Given that this is round 2, if I accept, the value will be multiplied by gamma^(2-1) which is gamma^1 = 0.98.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer on the table:** [0, 2, 0, 4, 0]\n     - 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 100 = 0\n     - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 7 = 14\n     - 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 80 = 0\n     - 4 units of item 4 = 4 \u00d7 17 = 68\n     - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 80 = 0\n     - Total value = 14 + 68 = 82\n     - Adjusted value for current round: 82 \u00d7 0.98 = 80.36\n   - **Comparing with outside offer:** 80.36 is far less than 1035, thus accepting this offer would be a mistake according to Mistake 4.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - **ACCEPT:** The value of the current offer (80.36) is much lower than my outside offer (1035). So, accepting doesn't make sense.\n   - **WALK:** If I walk, I get my outside offer value of 1035.\n   - **COUNTEROFFER:** I should consider a counteroffer that provides a value greater than 1035.\n\nTo maximize my value, I should offer a division that gives Player 1 the minimum they might accept while maximizing my unit value. Therefore, I must aim to keep high-value items like item 1 and item 5.\n\nLet's propose a counteroffer:\n- Maximize my share of items with highest per-unit value. Aim to give lesser-valued items to Player 1.\n- Proposed offer: [1, 7, 1, 3, 2] (Player 1 gets this division)\n\nCalculation of my share:\n- 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 100 = 400\n- 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 7 = 7\n- 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 80 = 80\n- 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51\n- 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 80 = 160\n- Total value = 400 + 7 + 80 + 51 + 160 = 698\n\nAlthough still below my outside value, this places me in a position to get better than the previous offers and pressure Player 1 towards a deal I'm willing to consider before walking away.\n\nMy action, in the valid format, is:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 7, 1, 3, 2]}\n```",

I need to adjust it to increase my value.\n\n   Let's try different quantities:\n\n   - Keep all units of item 4: 6 \u00d7 100 = 600\n   - Keep all units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 58 = 116\n   - Keep 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 23 = 69 \n   - Keep 0 units of item 2: 0 \u00d7 28 = 0\n   - Keep 0 units of item 5: 0 \u00d7 11 = 0\n\n   Total value from keeping these items would be: 600 + 116 + 69 + 0 + 0 = 785\n\n   This is still not sufficient, so I continue to adjust.\n\n   Let's try one more scenario, trading off lesser valued items:\n\n   - Keep all units of item 4: 6 \u00d7 100 = 600\n   - Keep 1 units of item 3: 1 \u00d7 58 = 58 \n   - Keep 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 23 = 69 \n   - Keep 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 28 = 56\n   - Keep 1 units of item 5: 1 \u00d7 11 = 11 \n\n   Total value from keeping these items would be: 600 + 58 + 69 + 56 + 11 = 794\n\n   This is still not enough, so I need to find a configuration that exceeds 882, with another attempt:\n\n   - Keep all units of item 4: 6 \u00d7 100 = 600\n   - Keep all units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 58 = 116\n   - Keep 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 23 = 46 \n   - Keep 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 28 = 56\n   - Keep 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 11 = 22\n\n   Total value from keeping these items would be: 600 + 116 + 46 + 56 + 22 = 840\n\n   Incrementally decrease the allocation to Player 2 to reach above my outside offer threshold:\n\n   - Keep all units of item 4: 6 \u00d7 100 = 600\n   - Keep all units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 58 = 116\n   - Keep 5 units of item 1: 5 \u00d7 23 = 115\n   - Keep 0 units of item 2: 0 \u00d7 28 = 0\n   - Keep 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 11 = 11\n\n   Total value from keeping these items would be: 600 + 116 + 115 + 0 + 11 = 842\n\n   This configuration exceeds 882.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nEnsure counteroffer results in a value greater than my outside offer:\n\nGiven the configurations above, I choose to make a COUNTEROFFER while keeping:\n- 2 units of item 1 \n- 2 units of item 2\n- 0 units of item 3\n- 0 units of item 4\n- 2 units of item 5\n\nWhich translates the COUNTEROFFER as: [2, 2, 0, 0, 2].\n\nThis offer values the items I retain above my outside offer value of 882. Therefore, as Player 1, I will make the following counter offer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 0, 0, 2]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

In round 1, this discount does not apply yet for deciding about the present value when accepting because it is only applied when proceeding to further rounds, which will reduce the negotiation value by reducing the effective valuation in subsequent rounds.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer to Me: [2, 2, 0, 0, 2]**\n  - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 27 = 54\n  - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 88 = 176\n  - 0 units of item 3 = 0\n  - 0 units of item 4 = 0\n  - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 2 = 4\n  - **Total Value of Current Offer to Me = 54 + 176 + 4 = 234**\n\n- **Compare to My Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer is 58. The current offer provides significantly more value to me (234 vs 58).\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nSince the current offer yields much higher value compared to my outside offer (234 against 58) and considering that this value is only going to be discounted in further rounds, it would be a mistake to walk away or make a counteroffer that doesn't guarantee more than this current high offer on this first round.

For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 8, 3, 2, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    22 x 3 + 70 x 8 + 56 x 3 + 59 x 2 + 13 x 1\n    which is 925 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 926. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "To proceed, I'll first summarize the current situation and values step-by-step, and then decide on the action to take.\n\n### 1) Analyze the current situation:\n\n- **Outside offer value**: My outside offer value is 926.\n  \n- **Values of the items**:\n    - Item 1: 22 per unit\n    - Item 2: 70 per unit\n    - Item 3: 56 per unit\n    - Item 4: 59 per unit\n    - Item 5: 13 per unit\n  \n- **Total pool of items**:\n    - 4 units of item 1\n    - 8 units of item 2\n    - 3 units of item 3\n    - 2 units of item 4\n    - 2 units of item 5\n\n- **Discount factor influence**: The discount factor, gamma = 0.98, affects the negotiation's dynamic as it reduces the present value of outcomes if the negotiation is prolonged. Thus, it's advantageous to reach an agreement sooner rather than later as the value of any offer I might accept is multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1), where r is the current round number.\n\n### 2) Assess the value of offers:\n\n- **Current offer**: There is no current offer from Player 2 to evaluate.\n\n- **Potential counteroffers**: I'll attempt to find an initial offer that exceeds my outside offer. I should aim for an outcome that ensures my total value is greater than 926.\n\n#### Calculate Potential Offers:\nTo exceed an outside offer value of 926 with an initial distribution proposal:\n\nHere's a plausible scenario of keeping more high-value items and offering fewer to Player 2:\n\n- Suppose I offer Player 2:\n  - 1 unit of item 1 (3 units for me)\n  - 1 unit of item 2 (7 units for me)\n  - 0 units of item 3 (3 units for me)\n  - 0 units of item 4 (2 units for me)\n  - 0 units of item 5 (2 units for me)\n\nThe value calculation becomes:\n- My value = 3 \u00d7 22 + 7 \u00d7 70 + 3 \u00d7 56 + 2 \u00d7 59 + 2 \u00d7 13 \n- My value = 66 + 490 + 168 + 118 + 26 = 868\n\nGiven this calculation, the value I receive is 868. This is still less than my outside offer value of 926. Hence, this is not a suitable counteroffer. We must revise it further.\n\n### Revised Counteroffer:\nLet's focus on keeping even more units with higher combined value. Let's try offering:\n\n- Offer Player 2:\n  - 0 units of item 1 (4 units for me)\n  - 2 units of item 2 (6 units for me)\n  - 0 units of item 3 (3 units for me)\n  - 0 units of item 4 (2 units for me)\n  - 1 unit of item 5 (1 unit for me)\n\nValue:\n- My value = 4 \u00d7 22 + 6 \u00d7 70 + 3 \u00d7 56 + 2 \u00d7 59 + 1 \u00d7 13\n- My value = 88 + 420 + 168 + 118 + 13 = 807\n\nStill, this does not surpass my outside offer value of 926.\n\n### Decision:\n\nIn light of this assessment and failed attempts to craft a better value offer, walking away remains an option given my guaranteed offer of 926 is not exceeded by the current calculations.\n\nTherefore, my action is to propose a different counteroffer, extensively revised to make sure the total substantially exceeds 926, but based on simplicity of closest calculation failure I will:\n \n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n\n   This offer needs adjustment, I will re-calculate while negotiations are underway, obtaining information from Player 2 to revise the numbers correctly in next rounds.",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 721. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 876 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

This reduces the value of future offers as the negotiation rounds progress. However, since we're in Round 1, this hasn't yet affected the value for this negotiation.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n   - **Current Offer Analysis:**\n     - The current offer to me is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Therefore, my total value if I accept it is 0.\n   - **Value Comparison:**\n     - Accepting the current offer yields 0, which is worse than my outside offer of 721.\n   \n3) **Make a Decision:**\n   - **Current Offer Decision:** Accepting the current offer would be a mistake as it provides less value than my outside offer.\n   - **Walking Decision:** Walking away right now guarantees me a value of 721.\n   - **Counteroffer Decision:** I need to propose a counteroffer that provides me with a value greater than 721.\n\nTo maximize my value, I'll propose a counteroffer where the units I keep provide a value greater than my outside offer.\n\nLet's calculate a counteroffer:\n- If I take all units of Item 1, 4 units of Item 2, 2 units of Item 3, and 1 unit each of Items 4 and 5, my value is:\n  - 4 units of Item 1: 4 \u00d7 63 = 252\n  - 4 units of Item 2: 4 \u00d7 63 = 252\n  - 2 units of Item 3: 2 \u00d7 70 = 140\n  - 1 unit of Item 4: 1 \u00d7 41 = 41\n  - 1 unit of Item 5: 1 \u00d7 55 = 55\n  - Total value = 252 + 252 + 140 + 41 + 55 = 740\n\nTherefore, I propose to give Player 1 the following units to keep the above allocation:\n- 0 units of Item 1\n- 4 units of Item 2\n- 1 unit of Item 3\n- 1 unit of Item 4\n- 1 unit of Item 5\n\nThis counteroffer provides me a value of 740, which is higher than my outside offer of 721.\n\nTherefore, my action is to propose the following counteroffer:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 4, 1, 1, 1]}\n```",

This means any value calculated for an offer must be adjusted by multiplying by 0.98.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n\n- **Current Offer (to me):** [0, 4, 1, 1, 1]\n  - Value if I accept:\n    - Item 2: \\(4 \\times 70 = 280\\)\n    - Item 3: \\(1 \\times 56 = 56\\)\n    - Item 4: \\(1 \\times 59 = 59\\)\n    - Item 5: \\(1 \\times 13 = 13\\)\n  - Total value = \\(280 + 56 + 59 + 13 = 408\\)\n  - Adjusted for discount factor: \\(408 \\times 0.98 = 399.84\\)\n\n- **Compare with Outside Offer:** 399.84 (current offer) < 926 (outside offer)\n\n- **Potential Counteroffers:**\n  - I need to propose a division where my retained value is greater than 926 adjusted for the discount factor to consider it over my outside offer.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision Based on the Analysis:\n\n- **Evaluate Current Offer:** The current offer is much lower than my outside option (399.84 < 926), so accepting it is not favorable.\n- **Consider Counteroffers:** Propose a counteroffer that ensures a better value than my outside option.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Offer 2 results in a value very close to my outside offer, which makes it a strategic initial proposal with minimal risk, as it suggests a generous remainder to Player 2 while still keeping me close to my fallback.\n\n### Step 3: Decision\n\nBased on the analysis, my action will be to make Offer 2 as my initial counteroffer to establish a basis for negotiation:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "To make an informed decision, let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 749.\n\n- **Values of the Items Involved:**\n  - Item 1: 38 per unit\n  - Item 2: 32 per unit\n  - Item 3: 94 per unit\n  - Item 4: 27 per unit\n  - Item 5: 54 per unit\n\n- **Total Pool of Items:**\n  - 2 units of item 1\n  - 5 units of item 2\n  - 3 units of item 3\n  - 8 units of item 4\n  - 7 units of item 5\n\n- **Discount Factor:** The discount factor is 0.98, which slightly reduces the value of future rounds. As it is round 1, no previous rounds' discount will apply.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer Analysis:**\n  - I am being offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1].\n  - Calculating its value:\n    - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 38 = 38\n    - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 32 = 32\n    - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 94 = 94\n    - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 27 = 27\n    - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 54 = 54\n  - Total value = 38 + 32 + 94 + 27 + 54 = 245\n\n  The current offer's total value is 245, which is significantly lower than my outside offer of 749.\n\n- **Potential Counteroffers:**\n  - I'll consider a counteroffer that keeps my total value above 749 or includes items with higher values.\n  - Example of a potential high-value division might involve prioritizing item 3, as it has the highest per-unit value.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nGiven that the current offer has a total value of 245, which is much less than my outside offer of 749, accepting it would not be optimal. Walking away would give me the certainty of receiving 749.\n\nI'll propose a counteroffer with a better distribution to myself to ensure a value exceeding the outside offer value (ideally maximizing item 3 and retaining a majority of units).\n\n**Proposed Counteroffer:**\n- Offer Player 1: [0, 1, 0, 3, 3]\n- Retaining for myself:\n  - Item 1: 2 units (2 \u00d7 38 = 76)\n  - Item 2: 4 units (4 \u00d7 32 = 128)\n  - Item 3: 3 units (3 \u00d7 94 = 282)\n  - Item 4: 5 units (5 \u00d7 27 = 135)\n  - Item 5: 4 units (4 \u00d7 54 = 216)\n- Total value to myself = 76 + 128 + 282 + 135 + 216 = 837\n\nThis ensures a significantly higher value than the outside offer and positions me advantageously for further negotiations.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 3, 3]}\n```",

Therefore, the sooner we reach a deal, the more valuable it is for both parties.\n\n### 2) Assessment of Offers:\n\n#### Current Offer:\n- Offer from Player 2: [0, 1, 0, 3, 3]. This means I would keep:\n\n  - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 88 = 176\n  - 4 units of item 2 = 4 \u00d7 43 = 172\n  - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186\n  - 5 units of item 4 = 5 \u00d7 90 = 450\n  - 4 units of item 5 = 4 \u00d7 69 = 276\n\n  Value = 176 + 172 + 186 + 450 + 276 = 1260\n  \n  This is less than my outside offer of 1430, so accepting is not an option.\n\n#### Potential Counteroffers:\nI need to ensure any counteroffer I make provides a total value to me that is greater than my outside offer of 1430.\n\nLet's calculate a valid counteroffer:\n\n1. **Test Offer [0, 2, 1, 6, 4]:** (Offering minimal units of least valuable items)\n\n   I keep 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5.\n\n   - Value = 2 \u00d7 88 + 3 \u00d7 43 + 2 \u00d7 62 + 2 \u00d7 90 + 3 \u00d7 69\n   = 176 + 129 + 124 + 180 + 207\n   = 816 \n\n   This is less than my outside offer.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

I aim to get a division that equals or exceeds my outside offer. Let's consider a counteroffer where I receive most of the high-value items:\n\n- Give Player 1: [0, 3, 0, 0, 0] \n  - They receive: 3 units of item 2\n  - I keep:\n    - 5 units of item 1 -> 5 \u00d7 57 = 285\n    - 1 unit of item 2 -> 1 \u00d7 99 = 99\n    - 6 units of item 3 -> 6 \u00d7 28 = 168\n    - 5 units of item 4 -> 5 \u00d7 98 = 490\n    - 4 units of item 5 -> 4 \u00d7 5 = 20\n    - Total value to me = 285 + 99 + 168 + 490 + 20 = 1062\n\nThis offer value is less than my outside offer but still higher than the current proposal.\n\nHowever, I realize that I need to shift closer towards my outside offer. \n\nLet's adjust further:\n\n- Give Player 1: [0, 3, 1, 0, 0]\n  - They receive: 3 units of item 2 and 1 unit of item 3\n  - I keep:\n    - 5 units of item 1 -> 5 \u00d7 57 = 285\n    - 1 unit of item 2 -> 1 \u00d7 99 = 99\n    - 5 units of item 3 -> 5 \u00d7 28 = 140\n    - 5 units of item 4 -> 5 \u00d7 98 = 490\n    - 4 units of item 5 -> 4 \u00d7 5 = 20\n    - Total value to me = 285 + 99 + 140 + 490 + 20 = 1034\n\nAfter recalculating carefully, this counteroffer still yields lower than my outside alternative, but allows exploring the negotiation further.\n\nTherefore, my action will be: \n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 1, 0, 0]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items.

This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 0, 0, 2, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    42 x 4 + 8 x 0 + 73 x 0 + 92 x 2 + 50 x 0\n    which is 352 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 353. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Hypothetically, if I keep all the high-value items for myself, like most items 2 and 4, I can propose alternative counters.\n\n  Suppose I keep:\n  - All items of high value to me, such as the majority of items 2 and 4, ensuring that the value sum exceeds 1346.\n\nGiven constraints, devising such a counter offer, while maintaining fairness, would be:\n- [1, 0, 3, 1, 4] (offer 1 item of item 1, 0 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 1 of item 4, all of item 5)\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\n1. **Should I Accept?** No, as the value is far less than my outside offer.\n2. **Should I Walk?** No, because I could still potentially get a better outcome.\n3. **Should I Counteroffer?** Yes, propose a better counter that maximizes my value, higher than the outside offer.\n\nConsidering the above analysis:\n\n- If I propose [1, 0, 3, 1, 4], and calculate my potential haul:\n\n  - My side:\n    - 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 57 = 228\n    - 4 units of item 2 = 4 \u00d7 99 = 396\n    - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 28 = 84\n    - 4 units of item 4 = 4 \u00d7 98 = 392\n    - 0 unit of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 5 = 0\n  - Sum = 1100 (higher than proposed offer, factor to time left, potentially surpasses my outside offer with the future state)\n\nThus, a valid refined counter-offer is a step towards better leverage.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 0, 0, 2, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    42 x 4 + 8 x 0 + 73 x 0 + 92 x 2 + 50 x 0\n    which is 352 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 353. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 3, 1, 0, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 3, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 3, 3, 3]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 3, 1, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 3, 1, 4]\n\n    What is your action?

This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

Your value would be:\n    83 x 1 + 32 x 2 + 81 x 3 + 41 x 1 + 19 x 3\n    which is 488 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 490. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

I will attempt to secure items based on their high value to me, especially Item 1 and Item 5.\n\n   Since there has been no exclusion regarding offering entire items, the optimal strategy is given by:\n\n   \n**Proposed Counteroffer:**\n\n   - **Counteroffer (My Offer to Player 1):** [0, 1, 1, 0, 2] -> This implies I keep 3 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 2 of item 5 for myself.\n\n   - **Calculation:**\n     - Keeping 3 of item 1 = \\(3 \\times 99 = 297\\)\n     - Keeping 1 of item 2 = \\(1 \\times 58 = 58\\)\n     - Keeping 2 of item 3 = \\(2 \\times 50 = 100\\)\n     - Keeping 1 of item 4 = \\(1 \\times 24 = 24\\)\n     - Keeping 2 of item 5 = \\(2 \\times 84 = 168\\)\n     - **Total Value of Proposed Counteroffer for Me:** \\(297 + 58 + 100 + 24 + 168 = 647\\)\n\n647 is greater than my outside offer (517), thus improving my position while aiming to maintain fairness by giving the opponent valuable portions, potentially making it agreeable for Player 1.\n\nThus, my action is:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 1, 0, 2]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 490. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 768 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 2, 3, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    83 x 1 + 32 x 2 + 81 x 3 + 41 x 1 + 19 x 3\n    which is 488 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 490. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 1, 0, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 1, 0, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

Also, any potential counteroffers calculated do not provide enough value over my outside offer, so there's no current advantage in accepting suboptimal offers while risking further rounds.\n\nThus, given the current circumstances without a counteroffer reaching the desired value:\n\nMy decision is to {\"action\": \"WALK\"} since remaining offers calculated also don't improve beyond outside offer.",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 4, 1, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 4, 1, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 3, 4, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    37 x 0 + 72 x 1 + 43 x 3 + 80 x 4 + 88 x 1\n    which is 609 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 611. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    85 x 0 + 23 x 0 + 42 x 0 + 22 x 0 + 95 x 1\n    which is 95 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 96. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To make a decision for the initial round of negotiation, let's go through the questions step by step:\n\n1) First, analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 96.\n   - The values of the items for me are:\n     - Item 1: 85 per unit\n     - Item 2: 23 per unit\n     - Item 3: 42 per unit\n     - Item 4: 22 per unit\n     - Item 5: 95 per unit\n   - The total pool of items available to divide is:\n     - Item 1: 4 units\n     - Item 2: 4 units\n     - Item 3: 5 units\n     - Item 4: 2 units\n     - Item 5: 2 units\n   - The discount factor reduces the value of offers accepted in later rounds. Specifically, offers accepted in rounds 2 and 3 will be worth 98% and 96.04% of their original value, respectively.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - There is no current offer on the table to consider accepting.\n   - I need to propose a starting offer. Let\u2019s consider a division that maximizes my value while being more attractive than my outside offer of 96.\n\nTo prevent making a mistake by offering less than my outside offer, I'll estimate various potential offers:\n- Proposal for items yielding a total value higher than my outside offer. For instance:\n  - Offer Player 2: 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5.\n\n  Calculating my retained value:\n  - Keep 4 units of item 1: 4 \u00d7 85 = 340\n  - Keep 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 23 = 23\n  - Keep 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 42 = 84\n  - Keep 0 units of item 4: 0 \u00d7 22 = 0\n  - Keep 0 units of item 5: 0 \u00d7 95 = 0\n\n  Total retained value = 340 + 23 + 84 + 0 + 0 = 447, which is significantly higher than my outside offer of 96. Thus, this offer avoids mistake 2.\n\n3) Make a decision:\n   - Since this proposed division results in a value significantly higher than my outside offer, I should present this as my initial offer.

Since we are in round 1, there is no immediate discount impact. The discount would be applied in future rounds if the negotiation does not end immediately.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n- **Current Offer [0, 3, 3, 2, 2]**: To calculate my total value if I accept the current offer from Player 1:\n  - Item 1: 0 units \u00d7 22 value = 0\n  - Item 2: 1 unit \u00d7 22 value = 22\n  - Item 3: 2 units \u00d7 56 value = 112\n  - Item 4: 0 units \u00d7 93 value = 0\n  - Item 5: 0 units \u00d7 91 value = 0\n  - Total Value = 22 + 112 = 134\n  \n  The current offer's total value for me is 134, which is less than my outside offer of 156. Therefore, accepting the current offer would not be beneficial.\n\n- **Potential Counteroffers**: I need to propose a counteroffer that would give me more value than my outside offer of 156. Let's calculate one potential option:\n  - Give Player 1: [0, 2, 3, 0, 0]\n  - My share:\n    - Item 1: 4 units \u00d7 22 = 88\n    - Item 2: 2 units \u00d7 22 = 44\n    - Item 3: 2 units \u00d7 56 = 112\n    - Item 4: 2 units \u00d7 93 = 186\n    - Item 5: 2 units \u00d7 91 = 182\n    - Total Value = 88 + 44 + 112 + 186 + 182 = 612\n\nThis counteroffer keeps my value significantly higher than my outside offer value, thus making it worth more than accepting the current offer or walking away.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\nBased on the above analysis, the current offer is not better than my outside offer of 156. Therefore, accepting it is a mistake (Mistake 4). Walking away with my outside offer is better but not optimal compared to a favorable counteroffer. A counteroffer such as [0, 2, 3, 0, 0] ensures I aim for a significantly higher value, making it a desirable strategy to maximize my outcome without falling into Mistakes 1, 2, or 3.\n\nTherefore, my action will be:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 3, 0, 0]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    85 x 0 + 23 x 0 + 42 x 0 + 22 x 0 + 95 x 1\n    which is 95 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 96. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 3, 3, 2, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 2, 3, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 3, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 1250. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1250. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 810 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [6, 5, 1, 3, 7] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    38 x 6 + 94 x 5 + 55 x 1 + 23 x 3 + 60 x 7\n    which is 1242 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1250. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Let's evaluate the situation step by step.\n\n### 1) Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **My outside offer value:** 1250\n- **Values of the items (my perspective):**\n  - Item 1: 38 per unit\n  - Item 2: 94 per unit\n  - Item 3: 55 per unit\n  - Item 4: 23 per unit\n  - Item 5: 60 per unit\n- **Total pool of items:**\n  - Item 1: 6 units\n  - Item 2: 5 units\n  - Item 3: 1 unit\n  - Item 4: 5 units\n  - Item 5: 7 units\n- **Discount factor:** The discount rate is 0.98. Since it's round 1, the discount factor does not apply yet to any deals made in this round.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table, so we cannot assess it.\n- **Potential counteroffers:** We need to propose an initial offer to Player 2. \n  - Calculate the values for arrangements where my value exceeds the outside offer of 1250.\n\nLet's consider keeping most of the high-value items:\n\n- Keep all units of each item:\n  - 6 units of Item 1 \u2192 6 \u00d7 38 = 228\n  - 5 units of Item 2 \u2192 5 \u00d7 94 = 470\n  - 1 unit of Item 3 \u2192 1 \u00d7 55 = 55\n  - 3 units of Item 4 \u2192 3 \u00d7 23 = 69\n  - 5 units of Item 5 \u2192 5 \u00d7 60 = 300\n\nTotal = 228 + 470 + 55 + 69 + 300 = 1122\n\nThis offer doesn't meet my outside offer of 1250. To improve it:\n\n- Revise keeping more value by reducing low-value items for me, like Item 4. \n  - Consider an offer: [0 units of Item 1, 1 unit of Item 2, 1 unit of Item 3, 4 units of Item 4, 2 units of Item 5] for Player 2.\n\nCalculation for what we keep:\n- 6 units of Item 1 \u2192 6 \u00d7 38 = 228\n- 4 units of Item 2 \u2192 4 \u00d7 94 = 376\n- 0 units of Item 3 \u2192 0 \u00d7 55 = 0\n- 1 unit of Item 4 \u2192 1 \u00d7 23 = 23\n- 5 units of Item 5 \u2192 5 \u00d7 60 = 300\n\nTotal = 228 + 376 + 0 + 23 + 300 = 927\n\nThis is still under my outside offer. Let's try another allocation.\n\n- Further adjust so that I keep highly valued items:\n  - Consider an offer: [1 unit of Item 1, 0 units of Item 2, 1 unit of Item 3, 0 units of Item 4, 2 units of Item 5] for Player 2.\n\nCalculation for what we keep:\n- 5 units of Item 1 \u2192 5 \u00d7 38 = 190\n- 5 units of Item 2 \u2192 5 \u00d7 94 = 470\n- 0 units of Item 3 \u2192 0 \u00d7 55 = 0\n- 5 units of Item 4 \u2192 5 \u00d7 23 = 115\n- 5 units of Item 5 \u2192 5 \u00d7 60 = 300\n\nTotal = 190 + 470 + 0 + 115 + 300 = 1075\n\nHowever, this is also problematic. I need to offer less to exceed my fallback value of 1250.\n\n**Proposed offer: [1, 0, 1, 2, 2]** to give Player 2:\n\n- My total value for this offer:\n  - 5 units of Item 1: 5 \u00d7 38 = 190\n  - 5 units of Item 2: 5 \u00d7 94 = 470\n  - 0 units of Item 3: 0 \u00d7 55 = 0\n  - 3 units of Item 4: 3 \u00d7 23 = 69\n  - 5 units of Item 5: 5 \u00d7 60 = 300\n\nTotal = 190 + 470 + 0 + 69 + 300 = 1029\n\nGiven the values above, I won't be able to keep my proposed items to achieve the 1250 target. Let's try proposing that I hold most high-value items and distribute others marginally to Player 2.\n\n**Revised Proposal: [1, 0, 1, 2, 2]** for Player 2, allowing myself to keep 1125.\n\n### 3) Make a decision based on the analysis\n\nGiven the analysis, I'll **attempt to optimize further or confirm all retention of the proposed calculation's feasibility** in parallel to considering enhanced offers for effective balancing, leading to choices beyond walk constraints:\n\n**Action: Handle Potential Values or END negotiations ** respectively.\n\nI will submit a revised action as follows (properly revised items allocated):\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 0, 2]} \n```\n\nThis counteroffer reevaluates tactical imbalances in item allocations by more closely matching optimal value near my guaranteed fallback while negotiating adjustments in item allocations.",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 1, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 1, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "To make a decision, let's go through the steps systematically:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - **Outside Offer Value:** 85.\n   - **Values of the Items Involved:**\n     - Item 1: 46\n     - Item 2: 28\n     - Item 3: 70\n     - Item 4: 51\n     - Item 5: 100\n   - **Total Pool of Items:**\n     - 6 units of item 1.\n     - 3 units of item 2.\n     - 2 units of item 3.\n     - 5 units of item 4.\n     - 2 units of item 5.\n   - **Discount Factor:** Each round reduces the value of the negotiation outcome by 0.98^(r-1). In round 1, this is 1, so the impact is zero at this point.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current Offer:** [0, 0, 1, 0, 1]\n     - Value calculation:\n       - 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 46 = 0\n       - 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 28 = 0\n       - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 70 = 70\n       - 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 51 = 0\n       - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 100 = 100\n     - Total value = 70 + 100 = 170\n   - **Comparison to Outside Offer:** 170 is greater than 85, so the current offer is better than the outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n   - **Should I accept the current offer?** Yes, since 170 > 85, accepting provides a higher value than my outside offer.\n   - **Should I walk away and take my outside offer?** No, as the current offer is better.\n   - **Should I propose a counteroffer?** It's unlikely that a better counteroffer would be accepted this early, and accepting guarantees a better outcome than walking away.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the current offer is beneficial as it offers a value greater than my outside offer. Therefore, the action is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",
                    "action": "ACCEPT"
