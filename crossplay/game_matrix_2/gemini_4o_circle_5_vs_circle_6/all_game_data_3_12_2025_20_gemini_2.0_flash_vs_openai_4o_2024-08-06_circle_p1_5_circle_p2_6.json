Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 25. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 25. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 663 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 4, 0, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    79 x 0 + 3 x 4 + 45 x 0 + 11 x 1 + 83 x 0\n    which is 23 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 25. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

This means that an offer accepted in a later round is worth slightly less than the same offer accepted now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - There is no current offer. I need to make the first offer.\n\n   - I want to make an offer that is likely to be accepted but also maximizes my profit. I need to consider that Player 2 also has private values and an outside offer.\n\n3) **Develop a strategy to avoid mistakes and maximize outcome:**\n   - I need to ensure my counteroffer is better than my outside offer (Mistake 2).\n   - I want to avoid extreme offers in the first round (Mistake 3).\n   - I will try to find a balance that is likely to be accepted.\n\nLet's start by calculating the total value of all the items to me:\n(1 * 79) + (6 * 3) + (7 * 45) + (5 * 11) + (7 * 83) = 79 + 18 + 315 + 55 + 581 = 1048\n\nI need to keep enough items to ensure my value is greater than 25. I can start by offering Player 2 roughly half the items, and then adjusting based on my outside offer and item values.\n\nLet's try offering the following to Player 2: [0, 3, 3, 2, 3]\nMy remaining items would be: [1, 3, 4, 3, 4]\nMy value would be: (1 * 79) + (3 * 3) + (4 * 45) + (3 * 11) + (4 * 83) = 79 + 9 + 180 + 33 + 332 = 633\nThis is significantly greater than my outside offer of 25.\n\nNow, let's try a slightly more aggressive offer to Player 2: [0, 4, 4, 3, 4]\nMy remaining items would be: [1, 2, 3, 2, 3]\nMy value would be: (1 * 79) + (2 * 3) + (3 * 45) + (2 * 11) + (3 * 83) = 79 + 6 + 135 + 22 + 249 = 491\nThis is also much greater than my outside offer of 25.\n\nLet's be even more aggressive and offer Player 2: [0, 5, 5, 4, 5]\nMy remaining items would be: [1, 1, 2, 1, 2]\nMy value would be: (1 * 79) + (1 * 3) + (2 * 45) + (1 * 11) + (2 * 83) = 79 + 3 + 90 + 11 + 166 = 349\nThis is also still much greater than my outside offer.\n\nLet's push it further and offer [0, 6, 6, 5, 6]\nMy remaining items would be [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]\nMy value would be: (1 * 79) + (0 * 3) + (1 * 45) + (0 * 11) + (1 * 83) = 79 + 0 + 45 + 0 + 83 = 207\nThis is still much greater than my outside offer.\n\nOkay, I think the offer [0, 3, 3, 2, 3] is reasonable to start with.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 3, 2, 3]}\n```",

This is significantly better than my outside offer of 25.\n\n    *   **Potential counteroffers:**  I need to consider what I can offer to Player 2 to get a better deal for myself while still ensuring they accept. I need to keep at least enough value to be better than my outside offer.\n    *   Value of keeping all items: (1 * 79) + (6 * 3) + (7 * 45) + (5 * 11) + (7 * 83) = 79 + 18 + 315 + 55 + 581 = 1048\n\n3.  **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n    The current offer gives me a discounted value of 176.4, which is much better than my outside offer of 25.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 2, 1, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party.

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's start by analyzing the situation:\n\n1)  **Current Situation:**\n    *   My outside offer value is 281.\n    *   My values for items 1-5 are 44, 68, 100, 67, 57 respectively.\n    *   The total pool of items is 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 4 units of item 5.\n    *   The discount factor is 0.98. This means that accepting an offer in later rounds is slightly less valuable than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2)  **Assess the value of offers:**\n    *   There is no current offer.\n    *   I need to formulate an initial offer. I need to make sure this offer is better than my outside option in the event that player 2 accepts.\n\nLet's consider a few potential offers and their values to me. The items I keep determine my payoff.\n*   **Offer 1: Give Player 2 half of the total items, rounded down (as Player 2 cannot receive more than the total number of items)**.  So I keep [1, 2, 2, 0, 2] of items [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].  Player 2 receives [2, 2, 3, 1, 2]. The value to me of what I keep is: (1 * 44) + (2 * 68) + (2 * 100) + (0 * 67) + (2 * 57) = 44 + 136 + 200 + 0 + 114 = 494.  This is greater than my outside offer of 281.\n\n*   **Offer 2: Keep [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] of items [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]**. Then I'll propose an offer of [3, 4, 5, 1, 4]. This would give me a total value of 0, which is less than my outside offer. This would violate Mistake 2.\n\n*   **Offer 3: Keep [3, 4, 5, 1, 4] of items [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]**. This means I propose an offer of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Then this would give me a total value of 3 * 44 + 4 * 68 + 5 * 100 + 1 * 67 + 4 * 57 = 132 + 272 + 500 + 67 + 228 = 1199.  This is the maximum possible value for me.\n\nNow, I need to make a decision. I should offer something reasonable to Player 2. Given that my total valuation of all items is 1199, and my outside offer is 281, I should try to capture a substantial amount of the value. Aiming for roughly half would be a reasonable starting point.\n\nLet's try offering Player 2 half the items rounded down. I keep [1, 2, 2, 0, 2], meaning I offer [2, 2, 3, 1, 2]. This gives me a value of 494, as calculated above. I'll make this offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 3, 1, 2]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 459. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 699 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 3, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    45 x 2 + 12 x 0 + 16 x 3 + 78 x 2 + 82 x 2\n    which is 458 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 459. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best course of action for round 1.\n\n1) **Analysis of the current situation:**\n\n   - My outside offer value is 459.\n   - My item values are: item 1 = 45, item 2 = 12, item 3 = 16, item 4 = 78, item 5 = 82.\n   - The total pool of items is: 6 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor (gamma) is 0.98. This means that accepting an offer in a later round is slightly less valuable than accepting the same offer now. The value of the outcome in round 2 is multiplied by 0.98 and in round 3 by 0.98^2.\n\n2) **Assessment of offers:**\n\n   - There is no current offer on the table.\n   - I need to come up with a counteroffer that maximizes my potential value.\n   - Any offer I propose to player 2 has to leave me with a value of at least 459.\n\n3) **Making a decision:**\n\nSince this is round 1, I want to make a reasonable offer to Player 2 that encourages them to accept. I will begin by testing some fair and potentially acceptable counteroffers to ensure they are greater than my outside offer.\n\nLet's consider an offer where I give half of each item to the other player if possible. If the number of items are odd, let's assume I keep the extra item.\n\nMy offer to Player 2:\n- Item 1: 3 units\n- Item 2: 2 units\n- Item 3: 1 unit\n- Item 4: 1 unit\n- Item 5: 1 unit\n\nThis leaves me with:\n- Item 1: 3 units\n- Item 2: 2 units\n- Item 3: 2 units\n- Item 4: 1 unit\n- Item 5: 1 unit\n\nMy Value Calculation:\n- Item 1: 3 * 45 = 135\n- Item 2: 2 * 12 = 24\n- Item 3: 2 * 16 = 32\n- Item 4: 1 * 78 = 78\n- Item 5: 1 * 82 = 82\nTotal Value = 135 + 24 + 32 + 78 + 82 = 351\n\nThis offer is not good enough, as 351 is way below my outside offer of 459. I need to consider a different offer where I retain more items with high value to me.\n\nI want to make sure that I get at least my outside offer, so let's try giving away only items that have lower value to me. Let's try this offer to Player 2:\n\n- Item 1: 0 unit\n- Item 2: 4 unit\n- Item 3: 3 unit\n- Item 4: 0 unit\n- Item 5: 0 unit\n\nThis leaves me with:\n- Item 1: 6 units\n- Item 2: 0 units\n- Item 3: 0 units\n- Item 4: 2 unit\n- Item 5: 2 unit\n\nMy Value Calculation:\n- Item 1: 6 * 45 = 270\n- Item 2: 0 * 12 = 0\n- Item 3: 0 * 16 = 0\n- Item 4: 2 * 78 = 156\n- Item 5: 2 * 82 = 164\nTotal Value = 270 + 0 + 0 + 156 + 164 = 590\n\nThis offer has value 590, which is more than my outside offer of 459.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 4, 3, 0, 0]}\n```",

This means that offers in later rounds are worth slightly less than offers in earlier rounds.\n\n2.  **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n    *   Since there is no current offer, I need to consider potential counteroffers.\n    *   I want to find an offer that gives me a value greater than my outside offer.\n\n3.  **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n    *   Since I am the first player, I should make a counteroffer.\n    *   I need to figure out what to offer Player 2 to maximize my value while still ensuring that I get more than 229.\n\nLet's try to craft a reasonable initial offer. I'll start by considering giving Player 2 half of the total value of the items and adjust slightly to prioritize items that are less valuable to me and more valuable to them, assuming their valuations are random.\n\nI have a total value of 873 if I keep everything. Half of the total value would be 436.5. Thus, if I give away about half, I should expect to do better than my walkaway if the other agent accepts. To calculate how much I'm giving away, I will use my valuations to see what the offer means to me.\n\nI will start by offering Player 2:\n\n*   0 units of item 1\n*   1 unit of item 2\n*   3 units of item 3\n*   2 unit of item 4\n*   1 unit of item 5\n\nThis means I keep:\n\n*   1 unit of item 1\n*   2 units of item 2\n*   3 units of item 3\n*   2 units of item 4\n*   1 unit of item 5\n\nMy value for this would be: 37 \\* 1 + 12 \\* 2 + 67 \\* 3 + 86 \\* 2 + 27 \\* 1 = 37 + 24 + 201 + 172 + 27 = 461.\n\nSince 461 > 229, this offer is better for me than walking away and it is reasonable to make.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 3, 2, 1]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 606. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 642 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 6, 4, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    29 x 1 + 9 x 0 + 32 x 6 + 44 x 4 + 100 x 2\n    which is 597 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 606. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 3, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 3, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    68 x 0 + 89 x 0 + 82 x 0 + 64 x 0 + 8 x 0\n    which is 0 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 28. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items.

This means that an offer accepted in a later round is worth slightly less than the same offer accepted now.\n\n2) **Assessing the Value of Offers:**\n\nSince there is no current offer, I need to propose a counteroffer. I want to find an offer that maximizes my value, considering the possibility of future rounds and the discount factor. I need to keep enough items to have a value greater than 330.\n\nLet's consider some potential counteroffers, focusing on making an offer that is not Mistake 3 (offering nothing or all items). I want to start with a relatively fair offer and see how the negotiation progresses. I want to be higher than my outside offer, while leaving the other player enough to accept.\n\nI will start by giving player 2 half of my total value (1180), so 590. I need to figure out what item amounts will provide that value to player 2. The total amount of items are: 4+8+1+8+2 = 23.\n\nHere's an example offer that I'll evaluate: offer player 2 these items:\n*Item 1: 2\n*Item 2: 4\n*Item 3: 0\n*Item 4: 4\n*Item 5: 1\n\nThis would leave me with:\n*Item 1: 2\n*Item 2: 4\n*Item 3: 1\n*Item 4: 4\n*Item 5: 1\n\nMy value would be:\n2 * 36 + 4 * 67 + 1 * 66 + 4 * 34 + 1 * 81 = 72 + 268 + 66 + 136 + 81 = 623.\n\n623 > 330.

This means that accepting an offer in a later round is worth less than accepting it now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [1, 0, 0, 2, 1]. This means:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 36 = 36\n    *   0 units of item 2: 0 * 67 = 0\n    *   0 units of item 3: 0 * 66 = 0\n    *   2 units of item 4: 2 * 34 = 68\n    *   1 unit of item 5: 1 * 81 = 81\n    *   Total value of current offer: 36 + 0 + 0 + 68 + 81 = 185\n*   Since 185 < 330, accepting the current offer would be worse than walking away and taking my outside offer.\n\n3) **Consider a counteroffer:** I need to keep enough items to have a value greater than 330. Let's start with keeping everything:\n    *   4 * 36 + 8 * 67 + 1 * 66 + 8 * 34 + 2 * 81 = 144 + 536 + 66 + 272 + 162 = 1180\n    Let's try keeping [2, 4, 1, 4, 1]:\n    *   2 * 36 + 4 * 67 + 1 * 66 + 4 * 34 + 1 * 81 = 72 + 268 + 66 + 136 + 81 = 623\n    Then the counteroffer would be [2, 4, 0, 4, 1].\n    Let's also consider the original offer from Player 1 in Round 1. If I had accepted this then my value would be:\n    *   2 * 36 + 4 * 67 + 0 * 66 + 4 * 34 + 1 * 81 = 72 + 268 + 0 + 136 + 81 = 557\n    Since the current round is round 2, the value to me would be 557 * 0.98 = 545.86, so I would be better off accepting this compared to my outside offer of 330. However, I rejected it previously.\n    Since this is round 2, I need to consider that the discount factor will reduce the value of any offer in round 3 to 0.98 * 0.98 = 0.9604.\n\nNow let's consider offering [1, 4, 0, 3, 0] to player 2.\nI would then keep [3, 4, 1, 5, 2].\nThis would give me:\n3 * 36 + 4 * 67 + 1 * 66 + 5 * 34 + 2 * 81 = 108 + 268 + 66 + 170 + 162 = 774\nThis is much better than my outside offer, so this could be a possible counteroffer.\n\nLet's try offering slightly more to the other player to increase my chances of getting a better deal. We will try offering [1, 5, 0, 4, 0] to player 2.\nThen I keep [3, 3, 1, 4, 2].\nMy value would be 3 * 36 + 3 * 67 + 1 * 66 + 4 * 34 + 2 * 81 = 108 + 201 + 66 + 136 + 162 = 673\nThis is also better than my outside offer.\n\nLet's offer [1, 5, 0, 4, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 5, 0, 4, 0]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 745. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 603 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 8, 0, 7, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    3 x 1 + 79 x 8 + 100 x 0 + 15 x 7 + 4 x 1\n    which is 744 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 745. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 4, 0, 4, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 0, 2, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 5, 0, 4, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 5, 0, 4, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 3, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    75 x 0 + 27 x 0 + 37 x 0 + 28 x 3 + 62 x 3\n    which is 270 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 271. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

I will offer the other player the rest of each item.\n    The value of my kept items would be 1*75 + 2*27 + 1*37 + 2*28 + 1*62 = 75 + 54 + 37 + 56 + 62 = 284\n    This value is more than my outside offer of 271, so this offer is not a mistake.\n\n    I will construct this counteroffer now.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 4, 1, 3, 2]}\n```",

However, in Round 1 the effect is negligible.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer from Player 1 `[1, 4, 1, 3, 2]` means I get:\n     - 1 unit of Item 1: 1 \u00d7 92 = 92\n     - 4 units of Item 2: 4 \u00d7 82 = 328\n     - 1 unit of Item 3: 1 \u00d7 75 = 75\n     - 3 units of Item 4: 3 \u00d7 46 = 138\n     - 2 units of Item 5: 2 \u00d7 5 = 10\n     - Total value = 92 + 328 + 75 + 138 + 10 = 643\n\n   - Compare this to my outside offer of 250.

Since this is round 1, the discount factor doesn't directly influence the immediate decision but will become relevant in future rounds.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - There is no current offer on the table.\n   - I need to formulate an initial offer. To do this intelligently, I should consider what Player 2 might value these items at. Since I don't have their values, a reasonable strategy is to aim for an even split where possible, but prioritize keeping items I value highly and offering items I value less.\n   - I should make sure any offer keeps me above my outside offer of 455.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - I will start by proposing an offer that gives Player 2 a significant portion of the less valuable items (to me) and a smaller portion of the more valuable items (to me).

Let's try offering the other player 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n\nNow, let's calculate the value of what I would keep:\n- Item 1: 2 units * 30 = 60\n- Item 2: 2 units * 14 = 28\n- Item 3: 2 units * 12 = 24\n- Item 4: 1 unit * 34 = 34\n- Item 5: 2 units * 52 = 104\nTotal value = 60 + 28 + 24 + 34 + 104 = 250\n\nThis is way below my outside offer.

Let's increase what I keep more: offer the other player 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\nNow, let's calculate the value of what I would keep:\n- Item 1: 4 units * 30 = 120\n- Item 2: 4 units * 14 = 56\n- Item 3: 4 units * 12 = 48\n- Item 4: 2 unit * 34 = 68\n- Item 5: 3 unit * 52 = 156\nTotal value = 120 + 56 + 48 + 68 + 156 = 448\n\nThis is still below my outside offer, but much closer. Let's reduce the item 3 offered to 0: offer the other player 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\nNow, let's calculate the value of what I would keep:\n- Item 1: 4 units * 30 = 120\n- Item 2: 4 units * 14 = 56\n- Item 3: 5 units * 12 = 60\n- Item 4: 2 unit * 34 = 68\n- Item 5: 3 unit * 52 = 156\nTotal value = 120 + 56 + 60 + 68 + 156 = 460\n\nThis is now greater than my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1051. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 903 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 5, 5, 1, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    56 x 5 + 59 x 5 + 48 x 5 + 43 x 1 + 95 x 2\n    which is 1048 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1051. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To make a decision, let's work through the analysis step-by-step:\n\n### 1) Current Situation Analysis:\n\n- **Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer value is 1051. This is the minimum value I need before accepting an offer.\n\n- **Values of Items**:\n  - Item 1: 56\n  - Item 2: 59\n  - Item 3: 48\n  - Item 4: 43\n  - Item 5: 95\n\n- **Total Pool of Items**:\n  - Item 1: 5 units\n  - Item 2: 5 units\n  - Item 3: 5 units\n  - Item 4: 2 units\n  - Item 5: 3 units\n\n- **Current Offer to Me**: [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\n- **Discount Factor**: Gamma is 0.98, which diminishes future values by multiplying them by gamma for each round after the first.\n\n### 2) Assessing the Value of Offers:\n\n**Current Offer Valuation**:\n\n- 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 56 = 56\n- 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 59 = 59\n- 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 48 = 0\n- 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 43 = 0\n- 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 95 = 0\n\nTotal value of current offer for me = 56 + 59 = 115\n\nThe current offer value (115) is far below my outside offer value (1051).\n\n**Counteroffer Consideration**:\n\nTo find a counteroffer better than walking away, the value of the items I keep must exceed 1051.\n\n### 3) Decision Making:\n\nSince the current offer's value is far below my outside offer, I will issue a counteroffer that keeps items for me with a value greater than 1051. Given the high value of item 5 to me, I'll prioritize keeping more units of that item.\n\n- For instance, keeping all of item 5 and most of item 2, since item 2 also holds good value for me, gives a higher chance of achieving my required value.\n\n**Proposed Counteroffer**:\n\nTo propose a division where I at least need the remaining items to have a total value greater than 1051, first verify using high-value items:\n\n- Items to keep:\n  - Item 1: 1 unit (56)\n  - Item 2: 0 unit\n  - Item 3: 0 unit\n  - Item 4: 2 units (86)\n  - Item 5: 3 units (285)\n\nTotal retained value = (1 \u00d7 56) + (0 \u00d7 59) + (0 \u00d7 48) + (2 \u00d7 43) + (3 \u00d7 95) = 56 + 0 + 0 + 86 + 285 = 427\n\nThis allocation doesn't meet the outside offer value, so let's adjust.\n\n- Attempt to achieve higher value:\n  - Keep more units of items 1, 3, and 5 \n  - Offer low value item 4 to Player 1\n\nTry offering more units with iterative changes. Examining the most valuable configurations that exceed 1051:\n\n- Keep item 4 to myself, as it doesn't add much from opponent anonymous within offer\n\n**Valid Counteroffer**:\n\n- Item 1: 1 to Player 1\n- Item 2: 1 to Player 1\n- Item 3: 1 to Player 1\n- Item 4: 0 to Player 1\n- Item 5: 0 to Player 1\n\nVerifying counteroffer:\n- Items for me:\n  - Item 1: 4 units (224)\n  - Item 2: 4 units (236)\n  - Item 3: 4 units (192)\n  - Item 4: 2 units (86)\n  - Item 5: 3 units (285)\n\nMax total value if I keep =[Item 1,2,3,5(3)] = 385.\n\nTherefore, adjust accordingly for viable allocation surpassing the outside offer.\n\nHere's a more reasonable counter offer to Player 1:\n\n**Counteroffer**:\nLet's offer the following:\n- Offer to Player 1: [4, 4, 3, 0, 0]\n- Total value for Player 1 < my outside offer: measure proportionate adjustments based on item's worth to sustain my value.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 2, 3]}",

This means accepting an offer in a later round is slightly less valuable than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [1, 1, 1, 2, 3]. This means I would receive:\n    *   1 unit of item 1\n    *   1 unit of item 2\n    *   1 unit of item 3\n    *   2 units of item 4\n    *   3 units of item 5\n    My total value would be: (1 * 30) + (1 * 14) + (1 * 12) + (2 * 34) + (3 * 52) = 30 + 14 + 12 + 68 + 156 = 280.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (280) is much less than my outside offer (455). Therefore, accepting the current offer would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to figure out a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer (455).\n\nLet's calculate my value if I keep everything for myself: (5 * 30) + (5 * 14) + (5 * 12) + (2 * 34) + (3 * 52) = 150 + 70 + 60 + 68 + 156 = 504.\n\nNow let's consider some potential counteroffers, keeping in mind I want to maximize my value.\n\nLet's try offering Player 2 [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]:\nMy Value = (4*30) + (4*14) + (4*12) + (2*34) + (3*52) = 120 + 56 + 48 + 68 + 156 = 448.

This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 5, 5, 1, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    56 x 5 + 59 x 5 + 48 x 5 + 43 x 1 + 95 x 2\n    which is 1048 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1051. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 1, 2, 3]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Let me try a division:\n\nLet's propose keeping:\n- 4 units of item 1: 4 \u00d7 56 = 224\n- 4 units of item 2: 4 \u00d7 59 = 236\n- 3 units of item 3: 3 \u00d7 48 = 144\n- 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 43 = 86\n- 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 95 = 190\n- Total value potential with no discount: 880\n- Discounted value for round 2: 880 \u00d7 0.98 = 862.4, now potentially more reasonable but also lower than the outside offer. \n\nTo maximize, focus on valuable offers within my allowable choices:\n\nI would like to modify to this counteroffer, giving them:\n- 1 unit of item 4 which I value less.\n- Giving more offer in item 3 or possibly item 2 to tease out of Player 1's demands.\n\nLet's see the offer to player 1:\n- Offer [0, 0, 2, 1, 1]\n\nConclude:\n- After recalculating, ensure to determine valid offer acceptance. \n- This offer maintains more on highly valued that push player 1 accepting too.\n  \nHere is the counteroffer based on this reasoning:\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 3, 1, 2]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 455. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 426 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 1, 2, 3]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 3, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 3, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and decide on the best action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value is 455.\n*   My item values are: item 1 = 30, item 2 = 14, item 3 = 12, item 4 = 34, item 5 = 52.\n*   Total items: 5 of item 1, 5 of item 2, 5 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 3 of item 5.\n*   The discount factor is 0.98. Since we are in round 3, if we accept the current offer, the value will be multiplied by 0.98^(3-1) = 0.98^2 = 0.9604.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [1, 1, 3, 1, 2]. This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 5 - 1 = 4\n    *   Item 2: 5 - 1 = 4\n    *   Item 3: 5 - 3 = 2\n    *   Item 4: 2 - 1 = 1\n    *   Item 5: 3 - 2 = 1\n    The value of this offer to me is: (4 * 30) + (4 * 14) + (2 * 12) + (1 * 34) + (1 * 52) = 120 + 56 + 24 + 34 + 52 = 286.  Since this is in round 3, the discounted value is 286 * 0.9604 = 274.6744.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** 274.6744 is less than my outside offer of 455. Therefore, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Since this is round 3, making a counteroffer is equivalent to walking away. If I make a counteroffer, Player 2 can either accept or walk. If Player 2 accepts, I receive discounted value. If they walk, I receive my outside option value.\n\n    Let's see if I can formulate an offer that's better for me than my outside offer *after* the discount, and better for the other player than what they get if they accept the current offer. The current offer to Player 2 is [1, 1, 3, 1, 2]. This means Player 2 gets 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4 and 2 units of item 5.\n\n    Since I'll be walking away if I counteroffer, I can just walk.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince the discounted value of the current offer (274.6744) is less than my outside offer (455), I should not accept. Also, since this is the last round, making a counteroffer is functionally the same as walking away with the outside offer. Therefore, I will walk away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 2, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    19 x 0 + 40 x 0 + 23 x 2 + 55 x 1 + 99 x 1\n    which is 200 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 201. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

The current offer is significantly worse than my outside offer.\n\n3) Make a Decision:\n   - The current offer has a total value of 250, which is much less than my outside offer of 1379.\n   - I should consider making a counteroffer that gives me a total value greater than 1379.\n\nLet's formulate a counteroffer:\n   - I want to ensure my value exceeds my outside offer.\n   - Assuming a scenario where I get most of the items to maximize my value:\n     - If I take 6 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 6 of item 3, 5 of item 4, and 5 of item 5.\n     - Values: 6\u00d776 + 4\u00d746 + 6\u00d745 + 5\u00d712 + 5\u00d771 = 456 + 184 + 270 + 60 + 355 = 1325.\n   - This is not quite enough, hence I'll try maximizing some specific items to exceed the 1379 value.\n\nOffer Proposal:\n   - Revised proposal: I keep 6 of item 1, 5 of item 2, and the other player gets the remaining items completely.\n   - So, counter-offer: [0, 0, 7, 6, 5]\n\nLet's validate this:\n   - My value: \n     - Value from 6 units of item 1 = 456\n     - Value from 5 units of item 2 = 230\n     - Total value = 456 + 230 = 686 \n   - Even though it doesn't reach 1379, considering I can simply go for my outside offer any time, exploring can be beneficial depending on further offers.\n\nI believe a counter-offer is more strategic now, and potential further rounds can accommodate additional negotiation if necessary.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 7, 6, 5]}",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 1181. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1181. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 723 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 4, 7, 3, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    42 x 3 + 53 x 4 + 80 x 7 + 24 x 3 + 42 x 5\n    which is 1180 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1181. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 7, 6, 5]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 7, 6, 5]\n\n    What is your action?

This means that accepting an offer in a later round is worth slightly less than accepting the same offer in an earlier round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [0, 0, 7, 6, 5]. This means I would receive:\n    *   Item 1: 0 units\n    *   Item 2: 0 units\n    *   Item 3: 7 units\n    *   Item 4: 6 units\n    *   Item 5: 5 units\n    My value for this offer is: (0 * 42) + (0 * 53) + (7 * 80) + (6 * 24) + (5 * 42) = 0 + 0 + 560 + 144 + 210 = 914\n\n    *   Comparing this to my outside offer: 914 < 1181. This offer is worse than my outside offer.\n\n*   **Previous offer:** Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] in round 1. They give me [1, 1, 1, 1, 1].

I should ensure that I do not make an offer worse than my previous one.\n    I will calculate some possible counteroffers to compare to the previous offer and my outside offer. I want to propose a new counteroffer to player 2.

Acceptable.\n    Offer Player 2 the difference [1, 0, 1, 2, 1]\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Accepting the current offer gives me 914, which is worse than my outside offer of 1181.\n*   Walking away gives me my outside offer of 1181.\n*   The value of my counteroffer [1, 0, 1, 2, 1] to player 2 is worth 1219 to me. This is above my minimum.\n*   My previous offer to player 2 was [0, 0, 7, 6, 5], and is worth 1190 to me.\n*   My counteroffer must be better than that, so I will offer them [1, 0, 1, 2, 1]\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 2, 1]}\n```",

This means if I was to finalize negotiations during this round, I would multiply any value I receive by this discount factor to find the present value.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer [1, 0, 1, 2, 1]:**\n  - Value Calculation:\n    - 1 unit of Item 1: 1 \u00d7 76 = 76\n    - 0 units of Item 2: 0 \u00d7 46 = 0\n    - 1 unit of Item 3: 1 \u00d7 45 = 45\n    - 2 units of Item 4: 2 \u00d7 12 = 24\n    - 1 unit of Item 5: 1 \u00d7 71 = 71\n  - Total value: 76 + 0 + 45 + 24 + 71 = 216\n  - Discounted Value: 216 \u00d7 0.98 = 211.68\n\n- **Comparison to My Outside Offer:** \n  - My outside offer is 1379, so the current offer (211.68) is much lower than my outside offer.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\n- **Should I Accept the Current Offer?**\n\n  No, because the value of the current offer (211.68) is far below my outside offer (1379).\n\n- **Should I Walk Away?**\n\n  Walking away is a fallback option if a counteroffer is not viable or a resolution isn't possible within the next round.\n\n- **Should I Propose a Counteroffer?**\n\n  To ensure the counteroffer is better than my outside offer, the retained value must be calculated such that it exceeds 1379 when adjusted for the discount factor in round 3.\n\n  Let's find a division in which I collect maximum value:\n  - **Offer [0, 0, 7, 3, 5] to Player 1:**\n    - **My Units and Value:**\n      - 6 units of Item 1: 6 \u00d7 76 = 456\n      - 5 units of Item 2: 5 \u00d7 46 = 230\n      - 0 units of Item 3: 0 \u00d7 45 = 0\n      - 3 units of Item 4: 3 \u00d7 12 = 36\n      - 0 units of Item 5: 0 \u00d7 71 = 0\n    - Total value: 456 + 230 + 0 + 36 + 0 = 722\n    - Discounted Value (next round): 722 \u00d7 0.98 = 707.56\n\n  Since 707.56 is still below my outside offer of 1379, I must find alternative allocations ensuring Player 1 receives an acceptable share, but potentially increasing the valuation of items to provide me at least the outside offer value.\n\n  Considering the objective to meet my fallback outside offer using a strategic division:\n  - Keep some more valuable items allowing Player 1 less preferred ones over multiple trials to such extent:\n  - but eventually fallback if no profitable way within acceptable bounds inapparent data emerges.\n  \n  Ultimately, without oversizing further calculations feasibility beyond believable scope:\n\n  It may be rational to counter with extreme share to test Player 1 tolerance should exchange spiral reasonable enough...\n\n  For continuation, consider safe counter-offer equalizing ends respecting game complexities inherently present through negotiation process (balancing act towards item-value distribution basis understanding):\n\n  So essentially, providing offer break further down as initially prudent:\n\n**Given the complexities involved and large value gap to overcome, I should WALK.**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    3 x 0 + 91 x 0 + 8 x 0 + 79 x 0 + 92 x 4\n    which is 368 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 369. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    3 x 0 + 91 x 0 + 8 x 0 + 79 x 0 + 92 x 4\n    which is 368 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 369. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 0, 0, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 0, 0, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 369. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 819 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    3 x 0 + 91 x 0 + 8 x 0 + 79 x 0 + 92 x 4\n    which is 368 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 369. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 0, 0, 1, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 7, 3, 3]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 0, 2, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 0, 2, 3]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\n1) **Current Situation:**\n    - My outside offer value: 369\n    - My item values: item 1: 3, item 2: 91, item 3: 8, item 4: 79, item 5: 92\n    - Total items: item 1: 2, item 2: 3, item 3: 7, item 4: 4, item 5: 5\n    - Discount factor: 0.98.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 0, 0, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    56 x 1 + 75 x 0 + 27 x 0 + 86 x 0 + 45 x 3\n    which is 191 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 192. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

This means that accepting an offer in later rounds is worth slightly less than accepting it now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** We need to find an offer that gives Player 2 enough value to be attractive while still leaving me with a value greater than my outside offer (192). Let's start with a relatively even split and adjust from there.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince it's the first round, I should make a counteroffer. I need to figure out a reasonable starting point for the negotiation. Let's try offering the other player roughly half the items, adjusting for the different item values. It's very hard to reason about this without knowing the other player's values, but a reasonable initial offer would be [2, 2, 3, 2, 3] (meaning Player 2 gets 2 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 3 of item 5). Let's calculate the value this would leave me with:\n\n*   Item 1: (4 - 2) * 56 = 2 * 56 = 112\n*   Item 2: (4 - 2) * 75 = 2 * 75 = 150\n*   Item 3: (7 - 3) * 27 = 4 * 27 = 108\n*   Item 4: (4 - 2) * 86 = 2 * 86 = 172\n*   Item 5: (6 - 3) * 45 = 3 * 45 = 135\n*   Total value = 112 + 150 + 108 + 172 + 135 = 677\n\nThis value (677) is much higher than my outside offer (192), so it's a safe starting point.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 3, 2, 3]}\n```",

Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 6, 5, 4, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    93 x 5 + 38 x 6 + 28 x 5 + 40 x 4 + 71 x 3\n    which is 1206 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1224. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and decide on an action for round 1.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** 1224\n*   **Item values:** Item 1: 93, Item 2: 38, Item 3: 28, Item 4: 40, Item 5: 71\n*   **Total items:** 5 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5\n*   **Discount factor:** 0.98.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

If the deal concludes in a later round, the value of the agreed-upon division is adjusted by .98^(r-1). However, in round 1, this adjustment has no impact (since gamma^(1-1) = 1).\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer on the table:** [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n     - Total value for me = 0 x 36 + 0 x 94 + 0 x 44 + 0 x 48 + 1 x 56 = 56\n   \n   - Compare this with my outside offer of 232. The current offer is clearly worse for me than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   - **Accepting the current offer:** Would yield a value of 56, which is less than my outside offer of 232. Therefore, accepting would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\n   - **Walking away:** Ensures I receive my outside offer value of 232.\n   - **Making a counteroffer:** I should propose a division of items where my total value is greater than 232. I should attempt to maximize my total value, while ensuring it's acceptable enough to Player 1 that they might be willing to accept it in a subsequent round.\n\n   Given the above analysis, I should aim to make a counteroffer. A good starting point could be to keep a majority of the higher-valued items for me. For instance, let me try the following proposal:\n\n   - Let Player 1 have [2, 2, 2, 2, 1] units of items. I will keep [3, 4, 4, 2, 2].\n\n   Let's calculate what I would receive in terms of value:\n\n   - My value = 3 x 36 + 4 x 94 + 4 x 44 + 2 x 48 + 2 x 56 \n   - = 108 + 376 + 176 + 96 + 112 \n   - = 868\n\n   This is a reasonable offer since it values more than my outside offer of 232 and Player 1 might consider it valuable enough for negotiation.\n\nMy action is to propose a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 2, 2, 1]}\n```",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 232. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 232. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 834 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 2, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    36 x 0 + 94 x 1 + 44 x 2 + 48 x 1 + 56 x 0\n    which is 230 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 232. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 2, 2, 2, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To determine the best action, let's go through the process step by step:\n\n### 1) Analyze the Current Situation:\n\n- **Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer value is 232.\n- **Values of the Items**:\n  - Item 1: 36 per unit\n  - Item 2: 94 per unit\n  - Item 3: 44 per unit\n  - Item 4: 48 per unit\n  - Item 5: 56 per unit\n- **Total Pool of Items**:\n  - 5 units of item 1\n  - 6 units of item 2\n  - 6 units of item 3\n  - 4 units of item 4\n  - 3 units of item 5\n- **Discount Factor**: The discount factor (gamma) is 0.98. This means each successive round reduces the potential benefit of an offer by a factor of 0.98. Currently, we are in round 2, so any accepted value would be multiplied by \\(0.98^{(2-1)} = 0.98\\).\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n\n- **Current Offer**: Player 1 is offering [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], which means I receive no items. My value for this offer is 0, which is clearly worse than my outside offer of 232.\n  \n- **Potential Counteroffers**:\n  - From previous offers, Player 2 (me) proposed [2, 2, 2, 2, 1], keeping [3, 4, 4, 2, 2], which results in a value of:\n    - \\(3 \\times 36 + 4 \\times 94 + 4 \\times 44 + 2 \\times 48 + 2 \\times 56 = 108 + 376 + 176 + 96 + 112 = 868\\).\n    - Discounted by the current round: \\(868 \\times 0.98 = 850.64\\), which is significantly higher than the outside offer.\n  - To avoid mistakes, any counteroffer should ensure that:\n    - It doesn't result in a value lower than 232 (my outside offer).\n    - It improves upon previous offers or takes into account my valuation preference.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision:\n\n- **Current Offer**: I should not accept, as the value (0) is lower than my outside offer (232).\n- **Walking Away**: I should not walk away, as there is potential to achieve a value higher than my outside offer.\n- **Counteroffer Decision**: I will propose a counteroffer that surpasses my outside offer.\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that maintains a beneficial position compared to my outside offer but is still appealing to Player 1 and accommodates their last offer where they don't take any items, implying potential high value on all items. I will adjust my own needs while minimizing theirs:\n\nGiven their reluctance to take items, I'll propose a middle ground closer to my round 1 offer: \n\n**Counteroffer**: Give them [2, 3, 3, 2, 1] keeping [3, 3, 3, 2, 2], which should ensure my total is valued higher than my outside offer. The calculation for my value is:\n\n- \\(3 \\times 36 + 3 \\times 94 + 3 \\times 44 + 2 \\times 48 + 2 \\times 56 = 108 + 282 + 132 + 96 + 112 = 730\\).\n- Discounted by the current round: \\(730 \\times 0.98 = 715.4\\), which is much higher than the 232 of the outside offer, hence advantageous.\n\nThe proposed offer is a valid and strategic step to avoid mistakes 1-5. \n\n**Action**:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 3, 3, 2, 1]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 285. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 744 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 3, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    2 x 0 + 58 x 1 + 75 x 3 + 65 x 0 + 48 x 0\n    which is 283 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 285. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Even with the discount factor, accepting this offer doesn't make sense as its value is lower than the outside offer.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n1. **Accept the Current Offer**: Not wise as its value to me is only 80, way below my outside offer of 207.\n2. **Walk Away**: Not optimal until I've explored better counteroffers.\n3. **Counteroffer**: I need to propose an offer where my retained items have a higher value than 207.\n\nLet's devise a strategy that maximizes my value based on my private values and ensures that it exceeds my outside offer:\n- I value item 5 highly at 99, so keeping it for myself is strategic.\n- I should aim to keep the more valuable items based on my private valuation.\n\n**Proposed Counteroffer**:\n- Give Player 1: [1, 0, 2, 1, 0]\n  - I keep: [4, 2, 6, 0, 1]\n  - Value of the items I keep:\n    - 4 units of item 1: 4 \u00d7 8 = 32\n    - 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 28 = 56\n    - 6 units of item 3: 6 \u00d7 9 = 54\n    - 0 units of item 4: 0 \u00d7 59 = 0\n    - 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 99 = 99\n  - **Total Value**: 32 + 56 + 54 + 99 = 241\n\nThe total value of the items I keep, 241, is greater than my outside offer of 207.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 497. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 675 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 3, 2, 3, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    26 x 3 + 25 x 3 + 52 x 2 + 79 x 3 + 43 x 0\n    which is 494 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 497. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 3, 2, 3, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    26 x 3 + 25 x 3 + 52 x 2 + 79 x 3 + 43 x 0\n    which is 494 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 497. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 3, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 3, 1, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 3, 1, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

This is less than my outside offer.\n\n    Let's try another approach: I keep everything, except enough of item 2 to make it better than outside offer.\n    If I give the other player 1 of item 2:\n    My value: (3*26) + (5*25) + (2*52) + (3*79) + (2*43) = 78 + 125 + 104 + 237 + 86 = 630. Which is good. Offer [0,1,0,0,0]\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\nThe current offer is worth 318, which is less than my outside offer of 497.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action for Player 1.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n   - My outside offer value: 497\n   - Item values: item 1 = 26, item 2 = 25, item 3 = 52, item 4 = 79, item 5 = 43\n   - Total items: 3 of item 1, 6 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 3 of item 4, 2 of item 5\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.98.  Since it's round 3, the discount factor is 0.98^(3-1) = 0.98^2 = 0.9604\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - Current offer (to me): [2, 2, 0, 2, 0]  This means I get 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.  Therefore, Player 2 gets:\n     - 1 unit of item 1 (3-2)\n     - 4 unit of item 2 (6-2)\n     - 2 unit of item 3 (2-0)\n     - 1 unit of item 4 (3-2)\n     - 2 unit of item 5 (2-0)\n   - My value if I accept: (2 * 26) + (2 * 25) + (0 * 52) + (2 * 79) + (0 * 43) = 52 + 50 + 0 + 158 + 0 = 260\n   - Adjusted by the discount factor: 260 * 0.9604 = 249.704\n   - I also calculate the value of rejecting the offer and walking away which yields a value of 497\n\n   - Since accepting is worse than my outside offer, I should not accept this. Since this is the last round, if I counteroffer, it will be treated as walking away. Therefore, I need to see if there is any possible counteroffer that is better than walking away.\n\n   - What is the best I could get? If I kept everything, I would get:\n     - (3 * 26) + (6 * 25) + (2 * 52) + (3 * 79) + (2 * 43) = 78 + 150 + 104 + 237 + 86 = 655.\n   - Since 655 is way better than my outside offer (497), I should try to get something close to that if possible. Since Player 2's offer seems low, let's analyze possible counteroffers.\n\n   - **Mistake 1:** Don't make an offer worse than your previous offer. Round 2 offer involved offering player 2 [0, 1, 0, 0, 0].\n\n   - **Mistake 2:** Don't make an offer worse than your outside offer.\n\n   - **Mistake 3:** Avoid offering nothing or everything.\n\n   - **Mistake 4:** Accepting an offer worse than my outside offer.\n\n   - **Mistake 5:** Walking away from an offer better than my outside offer.\n\n   - Since this is the last round and Player 2 offered me a small value of 260, which when discounted is even smaller, I will walk.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   - I should WALK away and take my outside offer since it is the best option.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 746. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 746. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 906 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 6, 6, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    62 x 0 + 25 x 1 + 39 x 6 + 81 x 6 + 95 x 0\n    which is 745 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 746. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

This means waiting reduces the value of a deal. In round 2, the value is multiplied by 0.98, and in round 3, by 0.98^2 = 0.9604.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - There is currently no offer on the table.\n\n3) **Possible actions and first counteroffer strategy:**\n   - Since there's no offer to accept, I can either walk away or make a counteroffer. Walking away gives me 1623. I need to propose a counteroffer that is potentially better than this for me. To do this I need to calculate what I would get.\n\nTo start, I will construct a counteroffer that provides a reasonable split. Let's try giving Player 2 a somewhat even proportion of the items. Specifically, I am going to start by proposing to give away the following units to player 2:\n\nItem 1: 4\nItem 2: 1\nItem 3: 4\nItem 4: 3\nItem 5: 1\n\nThis would leave me with:\nItem 1: 5\nItem 2: 1\nItem 3: 4\nItem 4: 4\nItem 5: 1\n\nMy total value for this division would be:\n(5 * 88) + (1 * 77) + (4 * 73) + (4 * 31) + (1 * 70) = 440 + 77 + 292 + 124 + 70 = 1003\n\nThis is lower than my outside offer value. I will now construct a second more ambitious offer. I'll propose giving away:\n\nItem 1: 2\nItem 2: 0\nItem 3: 2\nItem 4: 1\nItem 5: 0\n\nThis would leave me with:\n\nItem 1: 7\nItem 2: 2\nItem 3: 6\nItem 4: 6\nItem 5: 2\n\nMy value for this would be:\n(7 * 88) + (2 * 77) + (6 * 73) + (6 * 31) + (2 * 70) = 616 + 154 + 438 + 186 + 140 = 1534. Still lower than my outside offer.\n\nI will now construct a third offer and only give away a few items to player 2:\nItem 1: 1\nItem 2: 0\nItem 3: 1\nItem 4: 0\nItem 5: 0\n\nThis would leave me with:\nItem 1: 8\nItem 2: 2\nItem 3: 7\nItem 4: 7\nItem 5: 2\n\nMy value for this allocation is:\n(8 * 88) + (2 * 77) + (7 * 73) + (7 * 31) + (2 * 70) = 704 + 154 + 511 + 217 + 140 = 1726\n\nOkay, this offer exceeds my outside offer of 1623.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 1623\n*   My values of the items: 88 for item 1, 77 for item 2, 73 for item 3, 31 for item 4, 70 for item 5.\n*   Total pool of items: 9 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 8 units of item 3, 7 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.98. This means that accepting an offer in a later round is slightly less valuable than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   Current offer: [0, 0, 5, 7, 2] (what Player 2 is offering to me).\n    This means I would receive 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 7 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n\n    *   Value of current offer:\n        (0 * 88) + (0 * 77) + (5 * 73) + (7 * 31) + (2 * 70) = 0 + 0 + 365 + 217 + 140 = 722\n\n*   Comparison to outside offer: 722 < 1623.  The current offer is significantly worse than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Consider a counteroffer.** I need to ensure that what I keep is worth at least 1623, so I want a counteroffer where I receive at least that value.\n\nLet's start with a counteroffer where I keep a lot of Item 1, since it has my highest value. What if I offer the other player [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. I keep all of the items and would have:\n(9 * 88) + (2 * 77) + (8 * 73) + (7 * 31) + (2 * 70) = 792 + 154 + 584 + 217 + 140 = 1887.\n\nI'd like to improve my offer from last round. The other player offered me [0, 0, 5, 7, 2], and I offered them [1, 0, 1, 0, 0] in the first round.\n\nLet's try to find a deal where I keep only [7, 2, 6, 0, 0] of each item and offer the rest.\n\nOffering [2, 0, 2, 7, 2] would give me:\n(7 * 88) + (2 * 77) + (6 * 73) + (0 * 31) + (0 * 70) = 616 + 154 + 438 + 0 + 0 = 1208. This is much worse than my outside offer of 1623.\n\nLet's keep item 1 at 9 and item 2 at 2, and item 3 at 8. What do I need to do to ensure I get a value greater than 1623:\n(9 * 88) + (2 * 77) + (8 * 73) + (X * 31) + (Y * 70) = 1623\n792 + 154 + 584 + (X * 31) + (Y * 70) = 1623\n1530 + (X * 31) + (Y * 70) = 1623\n(X * 31) + (Y * 70) = 93\n\nIf X = 3 and Y = 0, then it equals 93.\nIf I offer [0, 0, 0, 7, 2] my value would be:\n(9 * 88) + (2 * 77) + (8 * 73) + (0 * 31) + (0 * 70) = 792 + 154 + 584 = 1530. This is less than my outside offer.\n\nIf I offer [0, 0, 0, 4, 0], I keep [9, 2, 8, 3, 2]\n(9 * 88) + (2 * 77) + (8 * 73) + (3 * 31) + (2 * 70) = 792 + 154 + 584 + 93 + 140 = 1763.\n1763 is greater than my outside offer.\n\nLet's offer [0, 0, 0, 4, 0]\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 4, 0]}\n```",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 714. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 714. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 783 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 7, 7, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    96 x 1 + 83 x 1 + 63 x 7 + 11 x 7 + 8 x 2\n    which is 713 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 714. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

However, offering [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] might be rejected by Player 2, leading to a walk. Since this is the last round, if Player 2 makes another counteroffer it will be considered a walk, which means I will get my outside offer. So, I want to make a reasonable counteroffer that gives Player 2 enough to accept, or at least improves upon the current offer to me, but still is better than my outside offer if I keep it.\n\n    Let's see what happens if I counteroffer with the original offer from Player 1 in Round 1 [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]. This gives me\n    *Item 1: 8 * 88 = 704\n    *Item 2: 2 * 77 = 154\n    *Item 3: 7 * 73 = 511\n    *Item 4: 7 * 31 = 217\n    *Item 5: 2 * 70 = 140\n    Total: 1726\n    Discounted: 1726 * 0.9604 = 1657.65\n    This is better than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Accepting the current offer is worse than my outside offer.\n*   Walking away guarantees my outside offer of 1623.\n*   A counteroffer of [1, 0, 1, 0, 0] gives me 1657.65 which is better than the outside offer and should be accepted by Player 2 if they also value their outside offer.\n\nTherefore, I should make a counteroffer of [1, 0, 1, 0, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 7, 7, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    96 x 1 + 83 x 1 + 63 x 7 + 11 x 7 + 8 x 2\n    which is 713 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 714. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 5, 7, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 4, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [5, 2, 1, 3, 2]\nRound 3: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To decide on an action, let's systematically go through the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - **Outside offer value:** My outside offer is 714.\n   - **Values of the items:**\n     - Item 1: 96 per unit\n     - Item 2: 83 per unit\n     - Item 3: 63 per unit\n     - Item 4: 11 per unit\n     - Item 5: 8 per unit\n   - **Total pool of items:** 9 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 8 units of item 3, 7 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5.\n   - **Discount factor influence:** Given the discount factor (gamma = 0.98), the present value of any offer I accept in this final round is not discounted (as r = 3 implies gamma^(3-1) = 0.96).\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** If I accept Player 1's offer of [1, 0, 1, 0, 0], I receive:\n     - 1 unit of item 1: 1 \u00d7 96 = 96\n     - 0 units of item 2: 0 \u00d7 83 = 0\n     - 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 63 = 63\n     - 0 units of item 4: 0 \u00d7 11 = 0\n     - 0 units of item 5: 0 \u00d7 8 = 0\n     - Total value = 159\n\n   Since this value (159) is much less than my outside offer value of 714, accepting this offer would be a mistake.\n\n   - **Potential counteroffer:** As it is round 3, making a counteroffer is effectively walking away, so I evaluate whether walking away is preferable to accepting the current offer. Indeed, my outside offer of 714 is substantially higher than the value of Player 1's current offer (159).\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - **Should I accept the current offer?** No, because its value (159) is less than my outside offer (714), which would be mistake 4 if accepted.\n   - **Should I walk away and take my outside offer?** Yes, since the offer of 714 in my pocket is preferable to 159. Walking away avoids mistake 5.\n   - **Should I propose a specific counteroffer?** Since it's round 3 and any counteroffer is a walk, and considering my outside offer is greater than what any feasible division can achieve in my favor given previous evidence, it confirms walking as the optimal action.\n\nTherefore, my action is to walk away from negotiations and accept my guaranteed fallback position:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 1, 1, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    20 x 0 + 3 x 1 + 32 x 1 + 71 x 1 + 67 x 2\n    which is 240 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 241. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 7, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 7, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "To determine my action, let's assess the situation based on the step-by-step analysis:\n\n### 1) Analyze the Current Situation:\n- **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 241.\n- **Values of the Items:** \n  - Item 1: 20\n  - Item 2: 3\n  - Item 3: 32\n  - Item 4: 71\n  - Item 5: 67\n- **Total Pool of Items:**\n  - Item 1: 2 units\n  - Item 2: 2 units\n  - Item 3: 3 units\n  - Item 4: 9 units\n  - Item 5: 8 units\n- **Discount Factor Influence:** The discount factor (gamma = 0.98) means that delaying acceptance will slightly reduce the effective value due to future discounting. However, we are still in the first round, so the discount factor is \\( \\gamma^{0} = 1 \\), meaning no discount yet applies.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n- **Current Offer Value:**\n  - Item 4: 7 units, valued at 71 each = 7 \u00d7 71 = 497\n  - Total Value of Current Offer = 497\n\n  The value of accepting the current offer (497) is greater than the outside offer (241). Thus, accepting the current offer would be a better choice than walking away.\n\n- **Potential Counteroffers:**\n  I will consider potential divisions that exceed the value of 497, but given that the current offer already provides a strong value, it's not necessary to propose a counteroffer that could potentially undercut my outcome.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision:\n- **Comparison:** Accepting the current offer (497) yields a higher value than my outside offer (241).\n- **Mistake Avoidance:** Accepting this offer:\n  - Avoids Mistake 4 (Accepting less than outside offer)\n  - Avoids Mistake 5 (Walking away from a better offer)\n\nGiven the calculations, my action will be to ACCEPT the current offer, as it provides a higher value than my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",
