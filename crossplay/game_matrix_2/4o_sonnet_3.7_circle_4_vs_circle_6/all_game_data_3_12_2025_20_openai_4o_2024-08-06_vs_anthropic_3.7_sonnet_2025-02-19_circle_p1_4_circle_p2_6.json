                    "response": "To make an informed decision, let's walk through the questions step by step:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - **What is my outside offer value?**  \n     My outside offer value is 925.\n\n   - **What are the values of the items involved?**  \n     - Item 1: Value = 3 per unit\n     - Item 2: Value = 33 per unit\n     - Item 3: Value = 80 per unit\n     - Item 4: Value = 97 per unit\n     - Item 5: Value = 11 per unit\n\n   - **What is the total pool of items?**  \n     - 2 units of item 1\n     - 1 unit of item 2\n     - 5 units of item 3\n     - 5 units of item 4\n     - 3 units of item 5\n\n   - **How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?**  \n     The discount factor (gamma = 0.98) means that if an agreement is reached in later rounds, the value of the agreement to both players is reduced. Specifically, the longer it takes, the less value each player receives, based on the power of (r-1).\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **There is no current offer to accept, as it's round 1.**\n   \n   - **For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?**\n     I should propose a division where my total value is at least 925, and preferably noticeably more, to account for the discount factor and negotiation dynamics.\n\n     For example, if I decide to take all of:\n     - 2 units of item 1: 2 * 3 = 6\n     - 1 unit of item 2: 1 * 33 = 33\n     - 5 units of item 3: 5 * 80 = 400\n     - 3 units of item 4: 3 * 97 = 291\n     - 1 unit of item 5: 1 * 11 = 11\n\n     This results in a total value of 741 for me, which is less than my outside offer.\n\n     Alternatively, taking:\n     - 2 units of item 1: 2 * 3 = 6\n     - 1 units of item 2: 1 * 33 = 33\n     - 5 units of item 3: 5 * 80 = 400\n     - 5 units of item 4: 5 * 97 = 485\n     - 2 units of item 5: 2 * 11 = 22 \n\n     This gives me 946, which is greater than my outside offer. Since this is round 1, I have room to negotiate and can provide some concessions.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   Given that the value of a possible max-out offer can exceed my outside offer value in round 1 due to the lack of current counteroffer from player 2 and consideration of positional opening strategy, it's ideal to propose an equitable initial offer:\n\n   - I counteroffer [0, 0, 2, 2, 2], which means I keep for myself:\n     - 2 units of item 1\n     - 1 unit of item 2\n     - 3 units of item 3\n     - 3 units of item 4\n     - 1 unit of item 5\n\n   Therefore, the initial proposed values to Player 2 are:\n   - Player 2 receives: \n     - 0 units of item 1\n     - 0 units of item 2\n     - 2 units of item 3\n     - 2 units of item 4\n     - 2 units of item 5\n\n   This keeps my value above the outside offer and promotes possibility of reaching an agreement as I advance the negotiation.\n\n   **My Action in Specified Format:**\n   ```json\n   {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 2, 2, 2]}\n   ```",

This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 2, 3, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    100 x 1 + 65 x 0 + 66 x 2 + 8 x 3 + 52 x 1\n    which is 308 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 309. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 2, 2, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 2, 2, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

This is my fallback value if I decide to walk away from the negotiation.\n\n- **Values of the Items**:\n  - Item 1: 64 per unit\n  - Item 2: 100 per unit\n  - Item 3: 69 per unit\n  - Item 4: 90 per unit\n  - Item 5: 33 per unit\n\n- **Total Pool of Items**:\n  - 4 units of item 1\n  - 1 unit of item 2\n  - 6 units of item 3\n  - 3 units of item 4\n  - 5 units of item 5\n\n- **Discount Factor**: The discount factor of 0.98 means that accepting an offer earlier is slightly better in terms of present value because waiting reduces the value in future rounds.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer**: There is no current offer yet, so no value to calculate here. I'm considering what offer to make to start the negotiation.\n\n- **Potential Offers**:\n  - I should ensure that whatever offer I make retains a value greater than my outside offer of 91 and avoids the mistakes outlined.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\n- To maximize my negotiation payoff in round 1, I should aim for an offer that potentially maximizes my retained value while still being acceptable to Player 2.\n\n- I want to avoid proposing something worse for me than my outside offer (Mistake 2).\n\n#### Calculating the Potential Value:\nLet's assess a couple of options for an initial offer:\n\n- **Example Offer: Propose a balanced division while retaining high-value items**:\n  - If I propose giving Player 2:\n    - 2 units of item 1 (worth 2 x 64 = 128 for me)\n    - 0 units of item 2\n    - 3 units of item 3 (worth 3 x 69 = 207 for me)\n    - 1 unit of item 4 (worth 1 x 90 = 90 for me)\n    - 2 units of item 5 (worth 2 x 33 = 66 for me)\n\n  Value retained by me:\n  - 2 units of item 1 = 2 x 64 = 128\n  - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 x 100 = 100\n  - 3 units of item 3 = 3 x 69 = 207\n  - 2 units of item 4 = 2 x 90 = 180\n  - 3 units of item 5 = 3 x 33 = 99\n\n  Total value retained = 128 + 100 + 207 + 180 + 99 = 714\n\nThis offer allows me to retain a value of 714, which is significantly above my outside offer value of 91.\n\nGiven this calculation, the initial offer seems reasonable since it preserves high value for me, it\u2019s likely to be seen as a fair initial offer, while it gives Player 2 some units to negotiate with.\n\nThus, my action at this stage is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 3, 1, 2]}\n```",

For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 6, 2, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    64 x 1 + 14 x 0 + 59 x 6 + 63 x 2 + 56 x 4\n    which is 768 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 769. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "To navigate this round of negotiation, let's begin by addressing the questions step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the current situation\n\n- **Outside offer value:** My outside offer is 586. This means if I walk away, I am guaranteed this value.\n- **Values of the items involved:** \n  - Item 1: 22 per unit\n  - Item 2: 12 per unit\n  - Item 3: 79 per unit\n  - Item 4: 92 per unit\n  - Item 5: 21 per unit\n\n- **Total pool of items:** \n  - 5 units of item 1\n  - 5 units of item 2\n  - 3 units of item 3\n  - 3 units of item 4\n  - 1 unit of item 5\n\n- **Effect of the discount factor:** The discount factor is 0.98. As the negotiation progresses to future rounds, the value of any agreement reached will be diminished by the discount factor raised to the power of (round number - 1).\n\n### Step 2: Assess the value of offers\n\nSince there is no current offer, we will focus on devising a counteroffer:\n\n#### Potential Counteroffer\nTo maximize my value while ensuring Player 2 has a viable incentive to engage, let's devise a tentative distribution:\n\nLet's start by proposing to give Player 2:\n- 2 units of item 1\n- 2 units of item 2\n- 1 unit of item 3\n- 1 unit of item 4\n- 0 units of item 5\n\nCalculate the value of the kept items for me:\n- 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66\n- 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36\n- 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 79 = 158\n- 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 92 = 184\n- 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 21 = 21\n\nTotal value if I retain these amounts = 66 + 36 + 158 + 184 + 21 = 465\n\n### Step 3: Make a decision\n\nComparison:\n- Offer value (465) is less than my outside offer value (586). Hence, making this offer would be a mistake as per Mistake 2.\n\nThus, we need to make adjustments so that the retained value at least respects my outside offer. Let's adjust and propose a less generous distribution. \n\n### Revised Offer Proposal\nI propose giving Player 2 a more modest:\n- 1 unit of item 1\n- 1 unit of item 2\n- 1 unit of item 3\n- 1 unit of item 4\n- 0 units of item 5\n\nCalculating my retained value:\n- 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 22 = 88\n- 4 units of item 2 = 4 \u00d7 12 = 48\n- 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 79 = 158\n- 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 92 = 184\n- 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 21 = 21\n\nTotal retained value = 499\n\nThis revised offer is still below my outside offer. It seems the division gives too much to Player 2, so further reduction is needed. Alternatively, consider walking away if subsequent calculations cannot exceed 586 without unfairly burdening Player 2 in future rounds.\n\nTo simplify, let's aim for a counteroffer that secures a reasonable negotiation start:\n\nCount of kept items resulting in acceptance or higher value must be offered; thus:\n\n### Final Offer Proposal\n- **Offer to Player 2:**\n  - 0 units of item 1\n  - 0 units of item 2\n  - 0 units of item 3\n  - 1 unit of item 4\n  - 1 unit of item 5\n\nCalculate held value:\n- 5 units of item 1 = 5 \u00d7 22 = 110\n- 5 units of item 2 = 5 \u00d7 12 = 60\n- 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237\n- 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 92 = 184\n- 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 21 = 0\n\nMy new retained value totals to = 591, which is finally above my outside offer of 586.\n\n### Action\nCounteroffer made based on maintaining hidden fallback:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]}\n```\n",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items.

This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 2, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    12 x 2 + 75 x 0 + 52 x 2 + 85 x 0 + 3 x 1\n    which is 131 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 132. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

Therefore, it does not make sense for me to accept the current offer.\n   - I should either propose a counteroffer that gives me a total value more than my outside offer or walk away. Given that it's realistic to secure a better deal based on my item valuations, I'd attempt to do this.\n\nLet's propose a counteroffer that is better for me:\n- I could offer what Player 2 originally suggested [4, 0, 2, 0, 1] which would leave me with [1, 5, 1, 3, 0].\n\nThe value if I keep [1, 5, 1, 3, 0]:\n   - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 22 = 22\n   - 5 units of item 2 = 5 \u00d7 12 = 60\n   - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 79 = 79\n   - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276\n   - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 21 = 0\n   - Total value = 22 + 60 + 79 + 276 + 0 = 437\n\nThis value is still below my outside offer of 586. Therefore, the counteroffer needs to be improved to ensure it exceeds my outside alternative.\n\nFinal decision:\nGiven the low value of the offers compared to my outside offer, I decide to WALK to secure my guaranteed outside offer value.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 3, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    54 x 0 + 26 x 0 + 4 x 3 + 74 x 0 + 7 x 1\n    which is 19 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 21. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 4, 2, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 4, 2, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "I need to analyze the current situation, evaluate the offer, and determine my best course of action.\n\n## 1. Current Situation Analysis\n- My outside offer value: 21\n- My item values: \n  - Item 1: 54 per unit (3 units total)\n  - Item 2: 26 per unit (4 units total)\n  - Item 3: 4 per unit (3 units total)\n  - Item 4: 74 per unit (4 units total)\n  - Item 5: 7 per unit (2 units total)\n- Total items: 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5\n- Current round: 1 (discount factor = 1)\n\n## 2. Evaluation of Current Offer\nPlayer 1 offered me [0, 4, 2, 1, 1], meaning I would get:\n- 0 units of item 1: 0 \u00d7 54 = 0\n- 4 units of item 2: 4 \u00d7 26 = 104\n- 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 4 = 8\n- 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 74 = 74\n- 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 7 = 7\n\nTotal value of this offer to me: 0 + 104 + 8 + 74 + 7 = 193\n\nThis is significantly better than my outside offer of 21.\n\n## 3. Analysis of Player 1's Offer\nFrom Player 1's offer, I can infer:\n- They want all units of item 1 (3 units), suggesting they value it highly\n- They don't want any of item 2, suggesting they value it less\n- They want 1 unit of item 3\n- They want 3 units of item 4, suggesting they value it highly\n- They want 1 unit of item 5\n\n## 4. Considering a Counteroffer\nI should try to keep the items I value most (items 1 and 4) while giving Player 1 what they may value more. Let me try keeping:\n- All of item 1 (3 units): 3 \u00d7 54 = 162\n- None of item 2 (0 units): 0 \u00d7 26 = 0\n- 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 4 = 4\n- 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 74 = 222\n- 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 7 = 7\n\nMy value would be: 162 + 0 + 4 + 222 + 7 = 395\n\nThis means offering Player 1: [0, 4, 2, 1, 1]\n\n## 5. Decision\nPlayer 1's current offer gives me a value of 193, which is much higher than my outside offer of 21.\n\nHowever, my potential counteroffer could give me a value of 395, which is even better.\n\nSince we're in round 1 and there's still room to negotiate, I'll make a counteroffer to try to get a better deal.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 4, 2, 1, 1]}",

For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 3, 6, 4, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    21 x 1 + 21 x 3 + 68 x 6 + 79 x 4 + 46 x 1\n    which is 854 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 857. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 3, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 3, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "I need to analyze the current situation and determine my best course of action.\n\n### 1) Analyzing the current situation:\n- My outside offer value is 857\n- My values per item: Item 1 = 21, Item 2 = 21, Item 3 = 68, Item 4 = 79, Item 5 = 46\n- Total pool: 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5\n- Discount factor is 0.98, which means I lose 2% of value if I wait until round 2, and about 4% if I wait until round 3\n\n### 2) Assessing the value of Player 1's offer:\nPlayer 1 offered me [1, 1, 3, 2, 1], meaning I would receive:\n- 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 21 = 21\n- 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 21 = 21\n- 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204\n- 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 79 = 158\n- 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 46 = 46\nTotal value = 450\n\nThe remaining items (what I'd give to Player 1) would be [1, 2, 3, 2, 2].\n\nPlayer 1's offer is worth 450 to me, which is significantly less than my outside offer of 857. I should not accept this offer.\n\n### 3) Formulating a counteroffer:\nLet me think of a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than my outside offer (857).\n\nIf I keep most of the high-value items (3 and 4) for myself, I should be able to exceed my outside offer:\n- If I keep all 6 units of item 3: 6 \u00d7 68 = 408\n- If I keep all 4 units of item 4: 4 \u00d7 79 = 316\nJust these two items give me 724.\n\nTo exceed my outside offer, I'll need about 133 more value from items 1, 2, and 5.\n- Keeping 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 21 = 42\n- Keeping 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 21 = 42\n- Keeping 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 46 = 92\nThese add up to 176.\n\nSo my proposed division (what I keep) would be [2, 2, 6, 4, 2], which gives me a total value of 724 + 176 = 900.\n\nThis means I'd offer Player 1 [0, 1, 0, 0, 1], which represents:\n- 0 units of item 1\n- 1 unit of item 2\n- 0 units of item 3\n- 0 units of item 4\n- 1 unit of item 5\n\nThis counteroffer gives me a value of 900, which exceeds my outside offer of 857.\n\n### 4) Decision:\nI should make a counteroffer. While my initial calculation would give me a good value, I might need to offer a bit more to Player 1 to increase the chances they accept. Let me adjust slightly:\n\nI'll offer Player 1 [0, 1, 1, 0, 1], which means I keep [2, 2, 5, 4, 2]:\n- 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 21 = 42\n- 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 21 = 42\n- 5 units of item 3 = 5 \u00d7 68 = 340\n- 4 units of item 4 = 4 \u00d7 79 = 316\n- 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 46 = 92\nTotal value = 832\n\nThis is still less than my outside offer (857), so I need to adjust further.\n\nLet me try [0, 1, 0, 0, 1] - keeping more of item 3:\nTotal value = 832 + 68 = 900 > 857\n\nThis works! My final counteroffer is to give Player 1 [0, 1, 0, 0, 1].\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]}",

A reasonable counteroffer could involve ensuring I keep more high-value items like Item 2 and Item 4.\n\n#### Create a New Counteroffer:\nSince I want to maximize my value, I could propose keeping the items with higher value to me. Adjusting the previous counteroffer a bit:\n\n- Counteroffer [1, 1, 3, 3, 1]:\n  - If I keep:\n    - Item 1 (1 unit): 1 \u00d7 23 = 23\n    - Item 2 (2 units): 2 \u00d7 82 = 164\n    - Item 3 (3 units): 3 \u00d7 59 = 177\n    - Item 4 (1 unit): 1 \u00d7 83 = 83\n    - Item 5 (2 units): 2 \u00d7 11 = 22\n    - Total = 23 + 164 + 177 + 83 + 22 = 469\n  - Present value in round 2 = 469 \u00d7 0.98 = 459.62\n\nThis counteroffer gives me a greater present value than my outside offer.

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 857. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 857. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 705 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 3, 6, 4, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    21 x 1 + 21 x 3 + 68 x 6 + 79 x 4 + 46 x 1\n    which is 854 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 857. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 3, 2, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 3, 3, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 3, 3, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 246. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 873 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To make an informed decision, let's follow the step-by-step analysis process:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **What is my outside offer value?**\n  - My outside offer value is 246.\n\n- **What are the values of the items involved?**\n  - Item 1: 48\n  - Item 2: 15\n  - Item 3: 71\n  - Item 4: 91\n  - Item 5: 66\n\n- **What is the total pool of items?**\n  - Item 1: 4 units\n  - Item 2: 5 units\n  - Item 3: 2 units\n  - Item 4: 3 units\n  - Item 5: 0 units\n\n- **How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?**\n  - The discount factor (gamma) is 0.98. This means that if negotiations extend beyond the current round, the realized value of the items will reduce by a factor of gamma raised to the power of (r-1). If this round is not conclusive, both sides will expect slightly lower returns in future rounds.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current offer:**\n  - There is currently no offer on the table from Player 2.\n\n- **Potential counteroffers:**\n  - To determine a viable initial offer, consider offering Player 2 a distribution of items where my value exceeds my outside offer of 246.\n\nLet's consider the following potential division:\n- Offer Player 2:\n  - Item 1: 2 units (value to me if kept = 2 \u00d7 48 = 96)\n  - Item 2: 3 units (value to me if kept = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45)\n  - Item 3: 1 unit (value to me if kept = 1 \u00d7 71 = 71)\n  - Item 4: 1 unit (value to me if kept = 1 \u00d7 91 = 91)\n  - Item 5: 0 units\n\n- My remaining value after this proposed offer:\n  - Item 1: 2 \u00d7 48 = 96\n  - Item 2: 2 \u00d7 15 = 30\n  - Item 3: 1 \u00d7 71 = 71\n  - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 91 = 182\n  - Item 5: 0 \u00d7 66 = 0\n  - Total value = 96 + 30 + 71 + 182 = 379\n\nThis proposed division gives me a total value of 379, which is higher than my outside offer value of 246.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\n- Given that I need to propose an initial offer, I want to ensure it exceeds the value of my outside offer and leaves room for negotiation.\n\n- Since my calculated value, after retaining some items, exceeds my outside offer, I should propose a counteroffer rather than WALKING away. This avoids Mistake 2 (offering something worse than my outside offer) and allows a better opportunity than Mistake 5 (WALKING away from a better offer).\n\nTherefore, my proposed offer will be to provide the following division to Player 2:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 3, 1, 1, 0]}\n```",

This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 5, 1, 3, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    79 x 4 + 72 x 5 + 47 x 1 + 3 x 3 + 75 x 0\n    which is 732 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 735. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

As negotiation rounds progress, the future value of the potential agreements decreases since each round diminishes the present value of the outcomes through this factor.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n\n- **Current Offer Value:** There is no current offer in round 1.\n\n- **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to propose an offer that is better than my outside offer value of 347.\n  - To construct a reasonable offer, I'll start by calculating my full value for all items:\n    - \\( 2 \\times 82 + 10 \\times 20 + 4 \\times 91 + 7 \\times 45 + 2 \\times 90 = 1223 \\)\n\n  I need to keep more than 347 in value for myself to make the counteroffer preferable to walking away. Here is one possible division:\n  - Offer [1 unit of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5] to Player 2.\n\n  My value if I keep the remaining is:\n  - \\( 1 \\times 82 + 5 \\times 20 + 2 \\times 91 + 4 \\times 45 + 1 \\times 90 \\)\n  - = 82 + 100 + 182 + 180 + 90 \n  - = 634\n\n  This is higher than my outside offer of 347, so this counteroffer ensures I achieve a better outcome.\n\n### 3) Decision:\nBased on the analysis, I should make a counteroffer rather than walking away or accepting since there's no current offer. The proposed counteroffer maximizes my potential value over my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 5, 2, 3, 1]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    65 x 0 + 18 x 0 + 29 x 1 + 65 x 0 + 81 x 2\n    which is 191 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 193. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 5, 2, 3, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 5, 2, 3, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

I'll try to keep more of the high-value items (items 1, 4, and 5) while offering more of the low-value items (items 2 and 3).\n\nPotential counteroffer [1, 7, 3, 2, 0]:\nItems I would keep:\n- 1 unit of item 1: 1 \u00d7 65 = 65\n- 3 units of item 2: 3 \u00d7 18 = 54\n- 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 29 = 29\n- 5 units of item 4: 5 \u00d7 65 = 325\n- 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 81 = 162\nTotal value to me: 65 + 54 + 29 + 325 + 162 = 635\n\nThis counteroffer would be worth 635 to me, which is better than the current offer of 489 and much better than my outside offer of 193.\n\nStep 4: Make a decision\n- Player 1's offer (489) is already much better than my outside offer (193)\n- My potential counteroffer (635) is better for me than Player 1's offer\n- This is only round 1, so I should try to get a better deal\n\nThe most strategic move is to make a counteroffer that keeps more of my high-value items while giving Player 1 more of the items I value less. This gives me the best chance of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 7, 3, 2, 0]}",

                    "response": "To determine the best course of action, let's carefully analyze the situation:\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n\n   - **Outside offer value**: 777.\n   \n   - **Values of the items involved**:\n     - Item 1: 75 per unit\n     - Item 2: 71 per unit\n     - Item 3: 81 per unit\n     - Item 4: 22 per unit\n     - Item 5: 25 per unit\n   \n   - **Total pool of items**:\n     - Item 1: 3 units\n     - Item 2: 3 units\n     - Item 3: 3 units\n     - Item 4: 5 units\n     - Item 5: 2 units\n   \n   - **Discount factor**: The discount factor \u03b3 = 0.98 means that waiting reduces the value of the negotiation outcome by this factor raised to the power of (r-1), where r is the current round.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n\n   - **Current offer**: None (as I'm the first to propose), so there's no current offer for me to accept or reject.\n   \n   - **Potential counteroffers (my initial offer)**: I need to propose an initial division of the items. Let's determine an offer that ensures I achieve more than my outside offer value (777) after considering the discounting effect.\n   \n   Since I'm making the initial offer and there's no discount yet applied in round 1, let's aim to maximize the value for myself and test what value different offers yield for me:\n\n   To maximize my outcome, I want to keep items with the highest value per unit for myself. For example:\n   - If I keep all of Item 3 (3 units x 81 = 243).\n   - Keep all of Item 1 (3 units x 75 = 225).\n   - Keep 2 of Item 2 (2 units x 71 = 142).\n   - Keep 1 of Item 4 (1 unit x 22 = 22).\n   - Keep 0 of Item 5 (0 units x 25 = 0).\n\n   Let's calculate what I'd offer to Player 2:\n   - Offer: 0 units of Item 1, 1 unit of Item 2, 0 units of Item 3, 4 units of Item 4, 2 units of Item 5.\n\n   - My total value with this offer:\n     - Item 1: 0 units for Player 2, so 225 value for me.\n     - Item 2: 2 units for me: 2 x 71 = 142\n     - Item 3: 3 units for me: 3 x 81 = 243\n     - Item 4: 1 unit for me: 1 x 22 = 22\n     - Item 5: 0 units for me: 0\n\n   - My total value from this division = 225 + 142 + 243 + 22 = 632\n   \n   This division gives me a total of 632, less than my outside offer of 777. So, I mustn't offer more generous terms to Player 2 and retain more value items.\n\n   Let's try a more self-serving division:\n   - Offer: 0 units of Item 1, 0 units of Item 2, 0 units of Item 3, 5 units of Item 4, 2 units of Item 5.\n\n   - My total value with this offer:\n     - Item 1: 225\n     - Item 2: 213\n     - Item 3: 243\n     - Item 4: 0\n     - Item 5: 0\n\n   - My total value from this division = 681\n\n   It's still below my outside offer of 777. Therefore, proposing the entire lower-value items while keeping all high-value for me does not match my fallback condition.\n\n   Let's propose: \n   - Offer: 0 units of Item 1, 0 units of Item 2, 0 units of Item 3, 3 units of Item 4, 2 units of Item 5 and keep 1 of Item 4 for myself. \n\n   - My total value with this offer:\n     - Item 1: 225\n     - Item 2: 213\n     - Item 3: 243\n     - Item 4: 2 x 22 = 44\n     - Item 5: 0 \n\n   - My total value from this division = 725.\n\n   This offer is closest to using much of the items' pool while aiming to match my outside offer more practically. Proposing extremely self-centered doesn't facilitate negotiations and proposes a better-valued division feasible with starting type distribution assumptions or strategic rooting to veer needs inspection accurately.\n\nI plan to propose a 2-unit Item 4 change initially and continue this incline underware.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n\nSince there is no initial offer, and my fallback option exceeds the calculated value of keeping the highest single-value items entirely; proposing a counteroffer balancing strategic influence seems possible while testing the water initially.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 4, 2]} \u2014 Offering lower-value items entirely enhances item security; susceptibility estimations exploit future attempts realigned possession opening future dialog possibility.\n",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 595. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 504 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 2, 5, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    5 x 0 + 56 x 3 + 10 x 2 + 70 x 5 + 27 x 2\n    which is 592 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 595. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 481. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 315 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

I'll primarily focus on items I value highly.\n\n- **A Revised Counteroffer:**  \n  - Offer the other player fewer high-value items to increase my total value share.\n  - To achieve a value exceeding 481, a focus is on maximizing retained item points.\n  - Proposed Offer: I will target at least a value of 481 based on calculated distribution.\n\n**Initial proposal (more reasonable focus key items):**  \n  - Offer to Player 2:\n    - 1 unit of item 1 (maximizes retention for me)\n    - 1 unit of item 2\n    - 1 unit of item 3\n    - 2 units of item 4 (receive more units)\n    - 1 unit of item 5\n    \n- Calculating again for values:\n  - For me:\n    - 4 units of item 1: 4 \u00d7 58 = 232\n    - 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6\n    - 6 units of item 3: 6 \u00d7 3 = 18\n    - 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 15 = 45\n    - 3 units of item 5: 3 \u00d7 26 = 78\n  - Total value: 232 + 6 + 18 + 45 + 78 = 379\n\nDuring this first offer, the incentive for them to consider might still be figuring out their distribution. I'll proceed to propose a more advantageous offer aligning closer to rejection.\n\n- **Final Action:** Since setting minimal but engageable demands has an increased chance of acceptance or improvement in negotiation. A greater boost will help align fuller probability to present acceptance.\n\nTherefore, I will propose the following offer to Player 2:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 2, 1]}\n```\nThrough my calculation, this offer leads to a distributed aim trying to maintain a better cumulative value well above my guaranteed fallback offer from the items I hold onto.",

If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "To decide the best course of action, let's break down the current situation and go through the reasoning step by step:\n\n### 1) Analyze the current situation:\n- **Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer value is 314.\n- **Values of Items**: \n  - Item 1: 51 per unit\n  - Item 2: 13 per unit\n  - Item 3: 30 per unit\n  - Item 4: 11 per unit\n  - Item 5: 63 per unit\n- **Total Pool of Items**:\n  - 2 units of item 1\n  - 8 units of item 2\n  - 5 units of item 3\n  - 4 units of item 4\n  - 0 units of item 5\n- **Discount Factor**: The discount factor is 0.98. Since this is the first round, it does not impact the current decision, but if the negotiation extends to further rounds, the value will be adjusted by this factor.\n\n### 2) Assess the value of offers:\n- **Value of Receiving All Items**: \n  - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 51 = 102\n  - 8 units of item 2 = 8 \u00d7 13 = 104\n  - 5 units of item 3 = 5 \u00d7 30 = 150\n  - 4 units of item 4 = 4 \u00d7 11 = 44\n  - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 63 = 0\n  - Total = 102 + 104 + 150 + 44 = 400\n\nGiven my outside offer of 314, any offer that results in a value less than this should not be accepted. I should aim for a division that maximizes my value while being realistic in terms of what Player 2 might accept.\n\n### 3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n- **No Current Offer to Accept**: Since there is no offer from Player 2 on the table yet, we can't evaluate that scenario.\n- **Initial Offer for Player 2**: To ensure I optimize my value and give Player 2 a reasonable share, I need to propose a fair division. However, since my fallback value (outside offer) is 314, I must ensure my proposed division yields at least this much value to me. \n\nFor a balanced initial offer that keeps me above my outside offer value, I might consider:\n\n- 1 unit of item 1 to Player 2\n- 4 units of item 2 to Player 2\n- 2 units of item 3 to Player 2\n- 2 unit of item 4 to Player 2\n\nCalculating the value I retain:\n\n- Remaining 1 unit of item 1: 1 \u00d7 51 = 51\n- Remaining 4 units of item 2: 4 \u00d7 13 = 52\n- Remaining 3 units of item 3: 3 \u00d7 30 = 90\n- Remaining 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 11 = 22 \n- Remaining 0 units of item 5: 0 \u00d7 63 = 0\n- Total Value Retained = 51 + 52 + 90 + 22 = 215\n\nThis initial offer yields a total value of 215 for me, which is less than my outside offer of 314. Therefore, this hypothetical division is not acceptable. I need to adjust this offer to preserve at least 314 for myself.\n\nTo make sure to keep at least the outside offer value, I should propose to give:\n\n- 0 units of item 1 to Player 2\n- 2 units of item 2 to Player 2\n- 2 units of item 3 to Player 2\n- 2 unit of item 4 to Player 2\n\nCalculating the value I retain:\n\n- Remaining 2 unit of item 1: 2 \u00d7 51 = 102\n- Remaining 6 units of item 2: 6 \u00d7 13 = 78\n- Remaining 3 units of item 3: 3 \u00d7 30 = 90\n- Remaining 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 11 = 22 \n- Remaining 0 units of item 5: 0 \u00d7 63 = 0\n- Total Value Retained = 102 + 78 + 90 + 22 = 292\n\nGiven the need to ensure I don't make a mistake by proposing less than my outside value, I will retain more value while offering a feasible set to Player 2:\n\nSo a better proposal from me will be slightly adjusted to keep more value:\n\n- Offer 0 units of item 1\n- Offer 3 units of item 2\n- Offer 2 units of item 3\n- Offer 2 units of item 4\n\nRecompute the value: \n- I keep 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 51 = 102\n- I keep 5 units of item 2: 5 \u00d7 13 = 65\n- I keep 3 units of item 3: 3 \u00d7 30 = 90\n- I keep 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 11 = 22\n- 0 units of item 5: 0 \u00d7 63 = 0\n- Total Value Retained = 102 + 65 + 90 + 22 = 279\n\nThis would mean I can still walk away since I will still not reach 314. So I will keep more:\n\n- Offer 0 units of item 1\n- Offer 2 units of item 2\n- Offer 2 units of item 3\n- Offer 1 unit of item 4\n\nRecompute the value: \n- I keep 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 51 = 102\n- I keep 6 units of item 2: 6 \u00d7 13 = 78\n- I keep 3 units of item 3: 3 \u00d7 30 = 90\n- I keep 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 11 = 33\n- 0 units of item 5: 0 \u00d7 63 = 0\n- Total Value Retained = 102 + 78 + 90 + 33 = 303\n\nGiven these calculations and to optimize further, while giving a bit for player 2, the calculated value to keep rounds off at:\n- Offer the other player: 0 item 1, 2 item 2, 1 item 3, 1 item 4, Needs thought for retaining:\n\nRecompute the value again, considering minimal but strategic:\n- I keep 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 51 = 102\n- I keep 6 units of item 2: 6 \u00d7 13 = 78\n- I keep 4 units of item 3: 4 \u00d7 30 = 120\n- I keep 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 11 = 33\n- 0 units of item 5: 0 \u00d7 63 = 0\n- Total Value Retained = 102 + 78 + 120 + 33 = 333 \n\nSo I give items efficiently ensuring both recieving if accepted meets some consideration but hoarding more priority units than I give for strategics wheras trade definite settle should include a small raw:\n\nSo the optimized initial offer that meets this need is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 2, 2, 0]}",

This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 6, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    37 x 0 + 25 x 6 + 97 x 0 + 82 x 0 + 50 x 0\n    which is 150 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 156. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 2, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 2, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Additionally, any counteroffer I've considered would be worse for me.\n\nFurthermore, making another counteroffer would push us to round 3, which would apply another discount factor, reducing my overall value.\n\nTherefore, I should accept the current offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 650. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 639 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Thus, there's an incentive to settle earlier, given that the offered value exceeds the discounted future value.\n\n2) **Assessing the Value of Offers:**\n\n   - **Current Offer:** None at the moment since this is the initial round and I'm starting the negotiations.\n   \n   - **Potential Counteroffers:**\n     - I should aim for an offer where the total value of what I keep is at least 650 to match or exceed my outside offer.\n\n   Let's calculate potential distributions and their values:\n\n   - If I keep all items:\n     - Value = (6 * 37) + (1 * 66) + (2 * 24) + (5 * 73) + (4 * 13) = 222 + 66 + 48 + 365 + 52 = 753\n\n   - In order to propose an equitable division but ensure I receive more than my outside offer value of 650, consider:\n\n     - Offer an initial division where Player 2 receives parts of lower-value items according to my values:\n       - I can offer Player 2: 3 units of Item 1, 0 units of Item 2, 1 unit of Item 3, 2 units of Item 4, 2 units of Item 5.\n       - What I would receive: 3 units of Item 1, 1 unit of Item 2, 1 unit of Item 3, 3 units of Item 4, 2 units of Item 5.\n       - My total value = (3 * 37) + (1 * 66) + (1 * 24) + (3 * 73) + (2 * 13)\n                       = 111 + 66 + 24 + 219 + 26\n                       = 446.\n\n   However, my calculation for this allocation leaves me with only 446, which is less than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a Decision:**\n\n   Since my calculated value for the offer I was considering is too low, I need to either adjust the offer to retain more valuable items or propose a new division which gives me at least 650 in value.\n\nLet's try another breakdown:\n- I offer Player 2:\n  - 2 units of Item 1, 0 units of Item 2, 1 unit of Item 3, 2 units of Item 4, 3 units of Item 5.\n  - My share is: 4 units of Item 1, 1 unit of Item 2, 1 unit of Item 3, 3 units of Item 4, 1 unit of Item 5.\n\nNow calculating the value for me:\n- Value = (4 * 37) + (1 * 66) + (1 * 24) + (3 * 73) + (1 * 13) \n        = 148 + 66 + 24 + 219 + 13\n        = 470.\n\nThis proposal still doesn't meet 650. I should instead maximize high-value items:\n- Let me calculate a proposal that grants me 650:\n\nPerhaps an offer should look like:\n- I offer Player 2:\n  - 1 unit of Item 1, 0 units of Item 2, 2 units of Item 3, 0 units of Item 4, 0 units of Item 5.\n  - My share is: 5 units of Item 1, 1 unit of Item 2, 0 units of Item 3, 5 units of Item 4, 4 units of Item 5.\n\nCalculating again:\n- Value = (5 * 37) + (1 * 66) + (0 * 24) + (5 * 73) + (4 * 13) \n        = 185 + 66 + 0 + 365 + 52\n        = 668.\n\nThis offer provides me with a value of 668, exceeding my outside offer value of 650, and is an equitable starting point with potential adjustments over rounds for fairness.\n\nTherefore, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 2, 0, 0]}",

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 650. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 639 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 2, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 0, 0, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 0, 0, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Analyzing the Current Situation\n\n- My outside offer value: 635\n- My item values: \n  - Item 1: 10 per unit\n  - Item 2: 7 per unit\n  - Item 3: 89 per unit\n  - Item 4: 75 per unit\n  - Item 5: 49 per unit\n- Total pool: 6 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5\n- Discount factor: 0.98 (currently in round 2, so any deal would be worth 0.98^1 = 0.98 of its original value)\n\n## 2. Assessing the Value of Offers\n\n### Current Offer from Player 1\nPlayer 1 is offering me [3, 1, 1, 1, 2] - this means I would keep these items while giving Player 1 [3, 0, 1, 4, 2].\n\nLet me calculate my value if I accept:\n- 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30\n- 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 7 = 7\n- 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 89 = 89\n- 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 75 = 75\n- 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 49 = 98\n- Total value before discount = 299\n- Total value with discount (0.98) = 299 \u00d7 0.98 = 293.02\n\nThis is significantly less than my outside offer of 635, so accepting would be a mistake.\n\n### Potential Counteroffer\nGiven my values, I should prioritize keeping items 3 and 4 which have the highest value to me (89 and 75 respectively). Let me try offering Player 1 the lower-value items.\n\nLet's try this offer (what I would give to Player 1): [3, 1, 0, 1, 2]\nThis means I would keep: [3, 0, 2, 4, 2]\n\nMy value calculation:\n- 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30\n- 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 7 = 0\n- 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 89 = 178\n- 4 units of item 4 = 4 \u00d7 75 = 300\n- 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 49 = 98\n- Total value before discount = 606\n- Total value with discount (0.98) = 606 \u00d7 0.98 = 593.88\n\nThis is still less than my outside offer of 635. Let me try another option.\n\nLet's try a more aggressive counteroffer (what I would give to Player 1): [2, 1, 0, 0, 2]\nThis means I would keep: [4, 0, 2, 5, 2]\n\nMy value calculation:\n- 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 10 = 40\n- 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 7 = 0\n- 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 89 = 178\n- 5 units of item 4 = 5 \u00d7 75 = 375\n- 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 49 = 98\n- Total value before discount = 691\n- Total value with discount (0.98) = 691 \u00d7 0.98 = 677.18\n\nThis is better than my outside offer of 635.\n\n## 3. Decision Making\n\nThe current offer from Player 1 is worth only 293.02 to me, which is much less than my outside offer of 635. Accepting would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\n\nMy counteroffer of [2, 1, 0, 0, 2] would give me a value of 677.18, which is better than my outside offer. This seems like a reasonable counteroffer that gives me more of the items I value highly.\n\nSince this is only round 2, making a counteroffer is reasonable. If we reach round 3 and no agreement is reached, I can always walk away and take my outside offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 0, 0, 2]}",

The current offer after discount is 159.42, which is significantly less than my outside offer value of 650.\n\nSince this is the third and final round, if Player 2 makes a counteroffer after this, it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n### Step 3: Make a decision\nBased on the analysis:\n- **ACCEPT** the current offer will give me a value of approximately 159.42, which is much less than my outside offer.\n- **WALK** will give me 650, guaranteed from my outside offer.\n\nGiven the choices, the rational decision is to choose my outside offer as it has a higher value than the current offer.

                    "response": "Let's proceed with the step-by-step analysis.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer value is 714.\n- **Values of the Items**:\n  - Item 1: 3 per unit\n  - Item 2: 69 per unit\n  - Item 3: 68 per unit\n  - Item 4: 47 per unit\n  - Item 5: 22 per unit\n\n- **Total Pool of Items**:\n  - 8 units of item 1\n  - 3 units of item 2\n  - 2 units of item 3\n  - 6 units of item 4\n  - 5 units of item 5\n\n- **Influence of Discount Factor**: The discount factor, gamma = 0.98, means that the value of any accepted offer will be slightly lessened if it takes more rounds to reach an agreement. The present value of an offer depends on how quickly it is accepted.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Value of Potential Offers**: Since it's the first round and there is no current offer on the table, I'll need to consider my initial offer.\n\nTo avoid Mistake 2 (\"Making an offer worse for me than my outside offer\"), I must ensure the total value to me of any proposed distribution is more than my outside offer of 714.\n\nLet's calculate the potential value to me for keeping different units of each item:\n\nGiven my outside offer is 714, I should try to ensure that the offer I propose to Player 2 maximizes my value while being more than 714. For example:\n\n- If I propose giving Player 2:\n  - 4 units of item 1 (I keep 4)\n  - 1 unit of item 2 (I keep 2)\n  - 1 unit of item 3 (I keep 1)\n  - 3 units of item 4 (I keep 3)\n  - 3 units of item 5 (I keep 2)\n\n  My calculated value would be:\n  - 4 units of item 1: 4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n  - 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 69 = 138\n  - 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 68 = 68\n  - 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 47 = 141\n  - 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 22 = 44\n  - Total value = 403\n\nThe value above is less than my outside offer of 714, so I would not propose such an offer.\n\nLet's propose a different distribution:\n\n- Propose giving Player 2:\n  - 6 units of item 1 (I keep 2)\n  - 2 units of item 2 (I keep 1)\n  - 2 units of item 3 (I keep 0)\n  - 4 units of item 4 (I keep 2)\n  - 3 units of item 5 (I keep 2)\n\n  And see if this affords me more than my outside offer:\n\n  - 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6\n  - 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 69 = 69\n  - 0 unit of item 3: 0 \u00d7 68 = 0\n  - 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 47 = 94\n  - 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 22 = 44\n  - Total value = 213\n\nAgain, my value is still less than my outside offer of 714. Let's try another combination:\n\n- Proposal to Player 2:\n  - 5 units of item 1 (I keep 3)\n  - 1 unit of item 2 (I keep 2)\n  - 0 units of item 3 (I keep 2)\n  - 5 units of item 4 (I keep 1)\n  - 4 units of item 5 (I keep 1)\n\nLet's compute our value:\n\n- 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 3 = 9\n- 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 69 = 138\n- 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 68 = 136\n- 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 47 = 47\n- 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 22 = 22\n- Total value = 352\n\nOnce again, this is less than 714. Therefore, we cannot propose this.\n\n**Decision**: Since all proposed offers give me a lower value than my outside offer of 714, and I want my proposed value to be higher than 714, I should ensure to keep more valuable items to increase my value.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nTo ensure my offer satisfies the requirement:\n- Keeping more valuable items such as item 2 (units of value 69) and item 3 (units of value 68) is essential.\n\nAn optimal offer can be structured as follows:\n- Give Player 2: [4, 0, 0, 5, 4]\n- I keep: [4, 3, 2, 1, 1]\n\nCalculate total value:\n- 4 units of item 1: 4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n- 3 units of item 2: 3 \u00d7 69 = 207\n- 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 68 = 136\n- 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 47 = 47\n- 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 22 = 22\n- Total value = 424\n\nThis makes my offer lower than my outside offer, leading to requiring someone to reject:\n\nOn second thought, I realize no reasonable split can satisfy the value constraint. In the interest of minimizing losses, I'll submit a final action:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 2. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 261 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    32 x 0 + 11 x 0 + 9 x 0 + 30 x 0 + 5 x 0\n    which is 0 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 2. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 2, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 2, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Let me propose a counteroffer where I keep more of items 1 and 4 (my high-value items) and give more of items 2, 3, and 5 (my lower-value items).\n\n   I'll propose offering Player 1: [0, 3, 4, 0, 1]\n   Which means I keep: [3, 2, 1, 2, 1]\n   \n   Value to me:\n   - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96\n   - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 11 = 22\n   - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 9 = 9\n   - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 30 = 60\n   - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 5 = 5\n   Total value to me = 192\n\n   This counteroffer is worth 192 to me, which is still much better than my outside offer of 2.\n\n4) Making my decision:\n   - I could accept the current offer (value: 64)\n   - I could walk away (value: 2)\n   - I could counteroffer [0, 3, 4, 0, 1] (value to me: 192)\n\n   While accepting would give me more than my outside offer, I believe I can do better by counteroffering.

Currently, we're in round 2, so the discount factor is \\(0.98^{1} = 0.98\\).\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer on the table:** [0, 3, 4, 0, 1] (units of each item offered to me)\n     - Value if accepted:\n       - Item 1: 0 \u00d7 82 = 0\n       - Item 2: 3 \u00d7 48 = 144\n       - Item 3: 4 \u00d7 31 = 124\n       - Item 4: 0 \u00d7 91 = 0\n       - Item 5: 1 \u00d7 87 = 87\n     - Total value: 0 + 144 + 124 + 0 + 87 = 355\n     - Adjusted for discount: 355 \u00d7 0.98 = 348.9\n\n   - **Comparison to outside offer:** My outside offer is 695, which is significantly higher than the current offer worth 348.9 when adjusted for the discount factor.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   - **Should I accept the current offer?** No, because the value of 348.9 is much lower than my outside offer of 695.\n   - **Should I walk away?** Not necessarily. There's room for negotiation, so I should consider making a counteroffer.\n   - **Should I propose a specific counteroffer?** Yes, I should propose a counteroffer that exceeds the value of my outside offer.\n\n   **Potential Counteroffer:**\n   Given my valuation and outside offer, I should aim to keep a combination of items that exceeds a value of 695. Let's calculate a fair counteroffer that ensures my value does not drop below this:\n\n   - Aim for a total value above 695. Maybe start by allocating more valuable items to myself while ensuring it's reasonable for Player 2 to potentially accept.\n   \n   - Possible counteroffer offers:\n     - Keep more valuable items like Item 1, Item 4, and Item 5 to myself.\n     - Offer less valuable Item 2 and Item 3 units to Player 2.\n\n   - **Example Counteroffer:** [0, 3, 4, 0, 1] -> I will keep: \n     - 3 units of Item 1 (246 value)\n     - 2 units of Item 2 (96 value)\n     - 1 unit of Item 3 (31 value)\n     - 2 units of Item 4 (182 value)\n     - 1 unit of Item 5 (87 value)\n\n     Total value: 246 + 96 + 31 + 182 + 87 = 642 (without imposing too much on Player 2).\n\nHence, my counteroffer to Player 2 would be giving them more units of less valuable items and keeping high-value items for myself.

This suggests they are satisfied with the division where they get [3, 2, 1, 2, 1] and I get [0, 3, 4, 0, 1].\n\n   Based on Player 1's initial offer [0, 1, 2, 1, 1], they seem to value item 1 highly (offered me none), and possibly item 4 as well. The fact that they accepted more of items 2 and 3 for themselves suggests these may be less valuable to them.\n\n4) Decision:\n   Since Player 1 has accepted my previous counteroffer, and the value to me (72.52) is significantly higher than my outside offer (2), the optimal decision is to accept this offer.\n\n   Even if I tried to negotiate for more, there's a risk of the negotiation extending to round 3 with further discounting, or Player 1 might walk away. The current offer is already very favorable compared to my outside option.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 6, 3, 1, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 5, 1, 4, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 5, 1, 4, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Let's evaluate the situation step by step:\n\n1) **Analyze the Current Situation:**\n   - **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 670.\n   - **Values of the Items Involved:** \n     - Item 1: 57\n     - Item 2: 67\n     - Item 3: 28\n     - Item 4: 100\n     - Item 5: 88\n   - **Total Pool of Items:**\n     - 2 units of item 1\n     - 9 units of item 2\n     - 5 units of item 3\n     - 4 units of item 4\n     - 3 units of item 5\n   - **Discount Factor:** The discount factor is 0.98. Since it's round 2, the multiplier for the present value calculation would be \\(0.98^{1} = 0.98\\), thereby slightly reducing the effective value of offers if accepted in later rounds.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n   - **Current Offer:** [1, 5, 1, 4, 1] is being offered to me. Calculate my total value:\n     - Item 1: 1 unit \u00d7 57 = 57\n     - Item 2: 5 units \u00d7 67 = 335\n     - Item 3: 1 unit \u00d7 28 = 28\n     - Item 4: 4 units \u00d7 100 = 400\n     - Item 5: 1 unit \u00d7 88 = 88\n     - Total value = 57 + 335 + 28 + 400 + 88 = 908\n     - Discounted value = 908 \u00d7 0.98 = 889.84\n\n   - **Comparison:** The discounted value of the current offer (889.84) is higher than my outside offer (670). Accepting the current offer is better than taking my outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a Decision:**\n   - Since the current offer provides a value of 889.84 (after considering the discount factor), which is greater than my outside offer value of 670, I should accept the current offer.\n\nThus, the best course of action is to accept the current offer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

                    "response": "To make an informed decision, let's systematically answer the questions requested:\n\n### 1) Analyzing the Current Situation\n\n- **My Outside Offer Value:** 454\n\n- **Values of the Items Involved:**\n  - Value per unit of item 1: 46\n  - Value per unit of item 2: 4\n  - Value per unit of item 3: 9\n  - Value per unit of item 4: 43\n  - Value per unit of item 5: 75\n\n- **Total Pool of Items:**\n  - 4 units of item 1\n  - 6 units of item 2\n  - 5 units of item 3\n  - 4 units of item 4\n  - 3 units of item 5\n\n- **Discount Factor:** The discount factor is gamma = 0.98, but since it's Round 1, there is no immediate impact on the value from future rounds at this moment.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer:** None\n\n- **Evaluate a Potential Initial Offer:**\n  Let's consider an offer that maximizes my value beyond my outside offer (i.e., more than 454). The goal is to keep items that contribute most to my total value.\n\n- **Calculate Total Values:**\n  - Total value if I keep all units:\n    - Item 1: 4 \u00d7 46 = 184\n    - Item 2: 6 \u00d7 4 = 24\n    - Item 3: 5 \u00d7 9 = 45\n    - Item 4: 4 \u00d7 43 = 172\n    - Item 5: 3 \u00d7 75 = 225\n    - Total value = 184 + 24 + 45 + 172 + 225 = 650\n\n- **Generate a Counteroffer:**\n  I need to ensure that the value retained from items offered is significantly above 454. Here's a possible division:\n\n  - Offer Player 2:\n    - 2 units of item 1\n    - 4 units of item 2\n    - 3 units of item 3\n    - 2 units of item 4\n    - 1 unit of item 5\n\n  - Remaining for myself:\n    - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 46 = 92\n    - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 4 = 8\n    - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 9 = 18\n    - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 43 = 86\n    - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 75 = 150\n    - Total retained value for me = 92 + 8 + 18 + 86 + 150 = 354\n\nThis proposed counteroffer results in a retained value of 354 for me. However, this is below my outside offer value of 454. \n\n### 3) Make a Decision\n\nTo make a more advantageous proposal, I must keep items that add more to my value while giving less valuable items to Player 2. I must ensure the retained value is higher than 454. Let's adjust the offer:\n\n- **Revised Offer to Player 2:**\n  - 1 unit of item 1\n  - 4 units of item 2\n  - 2 units of item 3\n  - 1 unit of item 4\n  - 1 unit of item 5\n\n- **Calculation:**\n  - Retained for myself:\n    - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138\n    - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 4 = 8\n    - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27\n    - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129\n    - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 75 = 150\n    - Total retained value = 138 + 8 + 27 + 129 + 150 = 452\n\nThe above-proposed allocation still results in 452, which is below 454, so we need to make further adjustments. \n\nAnother adjustment to ensure my total is above 454:\n\n- **Final Offer:**\n  - Offer Player 2:\n    - 1 unit of item 1\n    - 3 units of item 2\n    - 2 units of item 3\n    - 1 unit of item 4\n    - 1 unit of item 5\n\n- **Revised Calculation for Myself:**\n  - For myself:\n    - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138\n    - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12\n    - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27\n    - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129\n    - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 75 = 150\n    - Total retained value = 138 + 12 + 27 + 129 + 150 = 456\n\nNow, my retained value is 456, which is above my outside offer value of 454.\n\nBased on this analysis, here is the action:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 3, 2, 1, 1]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    32 x 0 + 87 x 0 + 87 x 0 + 74 x 0 + 35 x 0\n    which is 0 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 13. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Your value would be:\n    32 x 0 + 87 x 0 + 87 x 0 + 74 x 0 + 35 x 0\n    which is 0 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 13. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This suggests they value items 2 and 3 highly, similar to me (I value both at 87).\n\nIf I were to make a counteroffer, I could try to keep most of items 2 and 3 for myself while offering more of items 1 and 5 (my lower value items).\n\nPotential counteroffer: [2, 1, 1, 1, 2]\nThis would leave me with:\n- 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 32 = 64\n- 5 units of item 2 = 5 \u00d7 87 = 435\n- 4 units of item 3 = 4 \u00d7 87 = 348\n- 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 74 = 222\n- 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 35 = 35\n- Total value = 1104\n- Discounted value if agreed next round = 1104 \u00d7 0.98\u00b2 = 1060.9\n\n## Step 3: Make a decision\n\nI notice that Player 1 rejected my previous counteroffer of [2, 1, 1, 1, 2] and instead offered me [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. This is a more balanced offer, but it's less valuable to me than what I proposed.\n\nGiven we're in round 2 of 3, if I make another counteroffer and it's rejected, we'll be in the final round where I won't be able to make further counteroffers. This increases the risk.\n\nThe current offer of [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] gives me a value of 308.7, which is significantly better than my outside offer of 13. While I could try for more, there's risk in pushing too hard.\n\nSince the current offer is reasonable and much better than my outside option, I will accept it.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

It is essential to evaluate offers considering this diminishing value over time.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - There is currently no offer on the table.\n   - Since it's Round 1, I need to formulate an initial offer. My strategy is to propose a division where my value is maximized, preferably more than my outside offer value of 98.\n   - Calculate potential counteroffers:\n     - Let's consider keeping all the items for myself:\n       - 5 units of item 3: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15\n       - 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 19 = 57\n       - 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 14 = 28\n       - Total value = 15 + 57 + 28 = 100\n     - Since 100 is greater than my outside offer value of 98, keeping all the items results in a higher value.\n     - Any offer that would result in less than 2 units of item 3, less than any units of item 4, or less than 1 unit of item 5 is immediately less than my outside option.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - I should propose a counteroffer that allows me to keep all items because it's greater than my outside offer value.\n   - Offering all items would be a mistake, as I would be giving away too much value.\n   - Therefore, a strategically sound initial position would be to offer no units to Player 2, implicitly proposing to keep all items.\n\nGiven these considerations, I will propose the following initial offer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

Your value would be:\n    52 x 0 + 67 x 0 + 75 x 3 + 9 x 1 + 45 x 0\n    which is 234 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 240. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 3, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    52 x 0 + 67 x 0 + 75 x 3 + 9 x 1 + 45 x 0\n    which is 234 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 240. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This means:\n   - 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 52 = 0\n   - 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 67 = 0\n   - 5 units of item 3 = 5 \u00d7 75 = 375\n   - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27\n   - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 45 = 90\n   Total value = 492\n\n   With discount factor: 492 \u00d7 0.98 = 482.16\n\n3) Decision analysis:\n   The offer gives me everything, which is worth 482.16 after the discount factor. This is much higher than my outside offer of 240.\n\n   Player 1's current offer seems extremely generous - they're giving me everything. This suggests they might be desperate or have a very low outside offer. Either way, this is the best possible outcome for me.\n\n   There's no need to make a counteroffer since I can't possibly get more than everything. And walking away would mean settling for my outside offer of 240, which is much less than 482.16.\n\nTherefore, I should accept this offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

Since we're in round 2, the value from an agreement this round will be multiplied by \\(0.98^{1} = 0.98\\).\n\n### Step 2: Assess the value of offers\n\n- **Current offer value if accepted:** \n  - Receiving 1 unit of item 1 = \\(1 \\times 92 = 92\\)\n  - Receiving 1 unit of item 3 = \\(1 \\times 45 = 45\\)\n  - Total value from current offer = \\(92 + 45 = 137\\)\n  - Adjusted value considering the discount factor = \\(137 \\times 0.98 = 134.26\\)\n\n- **Comparison with my outside offer value:**\n  - Adjusted value of current offer = 134.26\n  - Outside offer value = 208\n  - Since 134.26 (current offer) < 208 (outside offer), accepting the current offer isn't beneficial.\n\n- **Potential counteroffers:**\n  - I need to propose a counteroffer where my value is greater than 208 when adjusted for the discount factor.\n  - I need to structure a proposal that maintains or increases the total value that I retain after the offer.\n\n### Step 3: Make a decision\n\n- **Current offer evaluation:** The current offer yields less than my outside offer when the discount is applied.\n- **Action:** Since the current offer is not better than my outside offer and I have room to negotiate, I should propose a counteroffer.\n\nLet's calculate a revised counteroffer:\n\nTo achieve a value greater than my outside offer of 208, after applying the discount factor, let's consider retaining the most valuable items, specifically items 4 and 1.\n\nAttempt a distribution like: \n- Give Player 2 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 3, and 1 unit of item 5. \n- This leaves me with: 7 units of item 1, 3 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5. (Since the other items count adds up)\n\n**Value to me after counteroffer:**\n- Item 1: \\(7 \\times 92 = 644\\)\n- Item 3: \\(3 \\times 45 = 135\\)\n- Item 4: \\(4 \\times 98 = 392\\)\n- Item 5: \\(1 \\times 37 = 37\\)\n- Total value retained = \\(644 + 135 + 392 + 37 = 1208\\)\n- Discounted value = \\(1208 \\times 0.98 = 1183.84\\), which is significantly better than my outside offer of 208.\n\nTherefore, the counteroffer will be [4, 0, 3, 0, 1] \u2014 giving Player 2 these amounts and retaining a higher value for myself.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 0, 3, 0, 1]}\n```",

In the first round, this factor has not yet reduced the value of any potential agreement. The factor will reduce the value of any deal reached in later rounds, which incentivizes me to either settle on a good offer early or negotiate strategically for higher value.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer**: There is no current offer on the table. Thus, I need to make an initial offer.\n- **Potential Counteroffers**:\n  I will evaluate how different offers compare to my outside offer of 391.\n\n  I'll calculate the total value of keeping various combinations of items. An effective strategy would be to make an offer such that the value of the items I retain exceeds 391 (my outside offer) and is also reasonable for Player 2, so they might accept it.\n\n#### Calculation for Offers\nLet me start with an offer where I keep:\n- 2 units of item 1\n- 3 units of item 2\n- 2 units of item 3\n- 3 units of item 4\n- 3 units of item 5\n\nThis would mean I offer Player 2:\n- 1 unit of item 1\n- 1 unit of item 2\n- 1 unit of item 3\n- 3 units of item 4\n- 3 units of item 5\n\n**Value Calculation for Keeping 2/3/2/3/3**:\n- 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 65 = 130\n- 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168\n- 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 67 = 134\n- 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 28 = 84\n- 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111\n- Total value = 627\n\nThis value is clearly greater than my outside offer value of 391. Additionally, the offer is equitable, but I will assess if it might be acceptable for Player 2.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision Based on the Analysis\n\nThe proposed division ensures my value exceeds my outside offer, and it's within a reasonable range to potentially be attractive to Player 2, balancing fairness and strategic advantage.\n\n#### Decision\nI'll make the counteroffer as described. Offering Player 2 [1, 1, 1, 3, 3] in an effort to keep the valuable items I need while encouraging Player 2 to accept the deal or make a reasonable counter.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 4, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    16 x 0 + 72 x 1 + 26 x 0 + 64 x 4 + 71 x 2\n    which is 470 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 471. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 3, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 3, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 531. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 600 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 3, 3, 3, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    35 x 1 + 68 x 3 + 3 x 3 + 35 x 3 + 59 x 3\n    which is 530 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 531. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 3, 2, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 3, 2, 3]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "I need to analyze the current offer and determine my best action.\n\n## 1) Current Situation Analysis:\n- My outside offer value: 531\n- My values per item: 35 for item 1, 68 for item 2, 3 for item 3, 35 for item 4, 59 for item 5\n- Total pool: 1 unit of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5\n- Current offer to me: [0, 1, 3, 2, 3] (I get 0 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 3 of item 5)\n- Discount factor: 0.98 (if we go to round 2, value is multiplied by 0.98)\n\n## 2) Value Assessment:\n\nValue of current offer to me:\n- 0 units of item 1: 0 \u00d7 35 = 0\n- 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 68 = 68\n- 3 units of item 3: 3 \u00d7 3 = 9\n- 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 35 = 70\n- 3 units of item 5: 3 \u00d7 59 = 177\n- Total value = 324\n\nThis is significantly less than my outside offer of 531, so I should not accept this offer.\n\nLet me think about a reasonable counteroffer.

I need to adjust my counteroffer.\n\nLet me try keeping more of item 5:\n[0, 0, 4, 1, 0]\n\nThis means I keep:\n- 1 unit of item 1: 1 \u00d7 35 = 35\n- 3 units of item 2: 3 \u00d7 68 = 204\n- 0 units of item 3: 0 \u00d7 3 = 0\n- 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 35 = 70\n- 4 units of item 5: 4 \u00d7 59 = 236\n- Total value to me = 545\n\nThis exceeds my outside offer of 531, so this is an acceptable counteroffer.\n\nActually, I'll slightly improve my offer to make it more likely to be accepted while still maintaining a value higher than my outside offer:\n\n[0, 0, 4, 0, 0]\n\nThis means I keep:\n- 1 unit of item 1: 1 \u00d7 35 = 35\n- 3 units of item 2: 3 \u00d7 68 = 204\n- 0 units of item 3: 0 \u00d7 3 = 0\n- 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 35 = 105\n- 4 units of item 5: 4 \u00d7 59 = 236\n- Total value to me = 580\n\nThis is well above my outside offer of 531, giving me a comfortable buffer.\n\nGiven the analysis, I'll make a counteroffer where I give the other player 0 units of items 1, 2, 4, and 5, and all 4 units of item 3.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 4, 0, 0]}",

However, since the outside offer is not influenced by this factor, it remains stable.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the value of offers\n- **Current offer on the table:** [0, 0, 4, 0, 0]\n  - Total value to me if I accept: 4 units of item 3 \u00d7 12 = 48\n- **Compare current offer to outside offer:** The current offer gives me a value of 48, which is much less than my outside offer of 414.\n- **Assess potential counteroffer:**\n  Let's calculate the maximum potential value I can aim for, which should be greater than my outside offer:\n  - Total value of all items if I kept everything:\n    - Item 1: 1 \u00d7 44 = 44\n    - Item 2: 3 \u00d7 29 = 87\n    - Item 3: 4 \u00d7 12 = 48\n    - Item 4: 3 \u00d7 31 = 93\n    - Item 5: 4 \u00d7 48 = 192\n    - Total value = 464\n  - An ideal target would be to retain items that give me the most value while ensuring the total value is greater than 414.\n\n### Step 3: Make a decision\n- **Possible counteroffer strategy:** I need to form a counteroffer ensuring my value exceeds 414 while considering player 2's potential value orientation.\n- **Let's propose a counteroffer:** Offer the least valued items that keep my value above 414.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "I need to carefully analyze the current offer and determine my best course of action.\n\n## 1) Analyzing the current situation:\n- My outside offer value is 531\n- My item values: 35 for item 1, 68 for item 2, 3 for item 3, 35 for item 4, 59 for item 5\n- Total pool: 1 unit of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5\n- Discount factor: 0.98 (already in round 2, so any deal will be multiplied by 0.98)\n\n## 2) Assessing the current offer:\nPlayer 1 is offering me: [0, 1, 4, 1, 0]\nThis means I would keep: [1, 2, 0, 2, 4]\n\nValue to me:\n- 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 35 = 35\n- 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 68 = 136\n- 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 3 = 0\n- 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 35 = 70\n- 4 units of item 5 = 4 \u00d7 59 = 236\nTotal value = 477\n\nWith the discount factor (0.98), this becomes: 477 \u00d7 0.98 = 467.46\n\nThis is less than my outside offer of 531, so I shouldn't accept this offer.\n\n## 3) Considering a counteroffer:\nI need to make a counteroffer that keeps enough value for me while being potentially attractive to Player 1.\n\nFrom Player 1's offers, I can infer:\n- They seem to value item 3 highly (offered me all 4 units both times)\n- They have shown interest in items 1 and 5 (offering me none)\n- Their valuation of items 2 and 4 seems mixed\n\nLet me propose a counteroffer where I keep the most valuable items to me and offer items that are less valuable to me:\n\nMy proposed allocation (what I keep):\n- 1 unit of item 1 (35 value to me)\n- 3 units of item 2 (204 value to me)\n- 0 units of item 3 (0 value to me)\n- 3 units of item 4 (105 value to me)\n- 3 units of item 5 (177 value to me)\nTotal value = 521\n\nWith discount factor (0.98): 521 \u00d7 0.98 = 510.58\n\nThis is still less than my outside offer of 531. Let me adjust.\n\nUpdated proposed allocation (what I keep):\n- 1 unit of item 1 (35 value to me)\n- 3 units of item 2 (204 value to me)\n- 0 units of item 3 (0 value to me)\n- 3 units of item 4 (105 value to me)\n- 4 units of item 5 (236 value to me)\nTotal value = 580\n\nWith discount factor: 580 \u00d7 0.98 = 568.4\n\nThis is better than my outside offer. So I would offer Player 1:\n[0, 0, 4, 0, 0]\n\nSince this is the same as my previous offer and Player 1 rejected it, I need to be more flexible. Given that we're in round 2 and I need to make progress, I'll concede a little:\n\nFinal counteroffer (what I keep):\n- 1 unit of item 1 (35 value to me)\n- 3 units of item 2 (204 value to me)\n- 0 units of item 3 (0 value to me)\n- 2 units of item 4 (70 value to me)\n- 4 units of item 5 (236 value to me)\nTotal value = 545\n\nWith discount factor: 545 \u00d7 0.98 = 534.1\n\nThis is still better than my outside offer, and I'm offering Player 1:\n[0, 0, 4, 1, 0]\n\nThis gives them all of item 3 (which they seem to value) and one unit of item 4.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 4, 1, 0]}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 3, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    51 x 0 + 19 x 3 + 42 x 3 + 95 x 0 + 89 x 1\n    which is 272 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 273. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [6, 1, 0, 4, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [6, 1, 0, 4, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "I'll work through this negotiation step by step to determine my best action.\n\n### 1) Analyzing the current situation:\n\n- My outside offer value: 273\n- My item values: item 1 = 51, item 2 = 19, item 3 = 42, item 4 = 95, item 5 = 89\n- Total pool: 6 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5\n- Discount factor: \u03b3 = 0.98 (this will reduce value in future rounds)\n\n### 2) Assessing the current offer:\n\nPlayer 1 has offered me [6, 1, 0, 4, 0], meaning I would receive:\n- 6 units of item 1 = 6 \u00d7 51 = 306\n- 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 19 = 19\n- 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 42 = 0\n- 4 units of item 4 = 4 \u00d7 95 = 380\n- 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 89 = 0\n\nTotal value of this offer: 306 + 19 + 0 + 380 + 0 = 705\n\nThis is significantly better than my outside offer of 273.\n\n### 3) Analyzing what Player 1's offer reveals:\n\nPlayer 1 is offering me all of items 1 and 4, which suggests they don't value these items highly. They're keeping all of items 3 and 5, suggesting they value these more highly. They're also keeping most of item 2.\n\n### 4) Considering a counteroffer:\n\nSince I highly value items 4 (95) and 5 (89), while moderately valuing items 1 (51) and 3 (42), and placing least value on item 2 (19), I should try to retain items 4 and 5 in particular.\n\nLet me consider offering Player 1 most of items 1 and 2 (which they seem willing to give away anyway), while keeping most of the high-value items for myself.\n\nPotential counteroffer [5, 2, 1, 1, 0] - giving Player 1 these amounts would leave me with:\n- 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 51 = 51\n- 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 19 = 19\n- 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 42 = 84\n- 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285\n- 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 89 = 178\n\nTotal value for me: 51 + 19 + 84 + 285 + 178 = 617\n\nThis counteroffer has a value of 617 for me, which is still significantly better than my outside offer, but less than the current offer (705).\n\n### 5) Decision:\n\nThe current offer on the table (value 705) is substantially better than both my outside offer (273) and my potential counteroffer (617). \n\nSince this is the first round and Player 1 has already offered me a very favorable deal, I should accept it. Even with the discount factor, it's unlikely I'll get a better deal in future rounds.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",
