Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 1370. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1370. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1014 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [8, 2, 3, 0, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    72 x 8 + 80 x 2 + 77 x 3 + 9 x 0 + 100 x 4\n    which is 1367 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1370. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action for round 1.\n\n1. **Analyze the current situation:**\n    - My outside offer value: 1370\n    - Item values: item 1: 72, item 2: 80, item 3: 77, item 4: 9, item 5: 100\n    - Total items: item 1: 8, item 2: 2, item 3: 3, item 4: 0, item 5: 6\n    - Discount factor: gamma = 0.98. This means that offers in later rounds are worth slightly less than offers accepted now.\n\n2. **Assess the value of offers:**\n    - Current offer: None\n    - Potential counteroffers: I need to find an offer that is better than my outside offer if accepted. I need to retain enough items to surpass 1370 in value.\n\n3. **Develop a strategy:** Since there is no current offer, I need to propose an initial offer. I need to determine how many items to offer Player 2 to maximize my potential value, considering my outside offer. It would be unwise to offer nothing or all the items.\n\nLet's try to make a counteroffer that exceeds my outside offer. I'll start by trying to keep a simple distribution of items and calculate its worth.\n\nLet's say I offer Player 2: [3, 1, 1, 0, 3]. That means I keep [5, 1, 2, 0, 3]. The value to me is:\n5 * 72 + 1 * 80 + 2 * 77 + 0 * 9 + 3 * 100 = 360 + 80 + 154 + 0 + 300 = 894. This is way less than my outside offer.\n\nI need to keep more items.\n\nLet's say I offer Player 2: [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]. That means I keep [7, 2, 3, 0, 5]. The value to me is:\n7 * 72 + 2 * 80 + 3 * 77 + 0 * 9 + 5 * 100 = 504 + 160 + 231 + 0 + 500 = 1395.

The current offer's value isn't discounted as this is the first round. Future offers will be discounted by a factor of 0.98 per round later they are concluded.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** [1, 0, 0, 0, 1] means I get:\n     - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 55 = 55\n     - 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 66 = 0\n     - 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 95 = 0\n     - 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 1 = 0\n     - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 65 = 65\n     - Total value = 55 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 65 = 120\n   - The current offer's value (120) is significantly less than my outside offer value (344).\n   - Counteroffers: I should aim for a value greater than 344.

It means that accepting an offer in round 2 gives me 0.98 times the value of that offer.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [2, 1, 1, 0, 3]. This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 8 - 2 = 6 units\n    *   Item 2: 2 - 1 = 1 unit\n    *   Item 3: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n    *   Item 4: 0 - 0 = 0 units\n    *   Item 5: 6 - 3 = 3 units\n    My value for this offer is: (6 * 72) + (1 * 80) + (2 * 77) + (0 * 9) + (3 * 100) = 432 + 80 + 154 + 0 + 300 = 966.\n    Since this is round 2, the discounted value is 966 * 0.98 = 946.68. This is less than my outside offer of 1370.\n*   **Round 1 offer (Player 1):** Offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 1] (to Player 2). This means I keep: 7, 2, 3, 0, 5 which has a value of 7 * 72 + 2 * 80 + 3 * 77 + 0 * 9 + 5 * 100 = 504 + 160 + 231 + 0 + 500 = 1395.\n*   **Round 1 offer (Player 2):** Offered [2, 1, 1, 0, 3] (to me). This means I keep: 6, 1, 2, 0, 3 which has a value of 6 * 72 + 1 * 80 + 2 * 77 + 0 * 9 + 3 * 100 = 432 + 80 + 154 + 0 + 300 = 966.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer (946.68) is worse than my outside offer (1370).\n*   My previous offer (1395) was better than my outside offer, meaning I can make a counteroffer that is more advantageous for me while still being better than my outside offer.\n\nLet's try offering Player 2 [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]. This means I keep [7, 2, 3, 0, 5] which has a value of 7*72 + 2*80 + 3*77 + 0*9 + 5*100 = 504 + 160 + 231 + 0 + 500 = 1395. This is better than my outside offer of 1370.\nDiscounted Value: 1395 * 0.98 = 1367.1.\n\nSo, let's try again to make sure I can reach my outside option.\n\nLet's propose an offer where my value is slightly above my outside option (e.g., 1371):\n\nItem 1: 8 units, value 72 = 576\nItem 2: 2 units, value 80 = 160\nItem 3: 3 units, value 77 = 231\nItem 4: 0 units, value 9 = 0\nItem 5: 6 units, value 100 = 600\n\nLet's offer Player 2 items such that I receive close to 1370/0.98 = 1400 discounted value.\n\nKeeping [6, 1, 2, 0, 3]: 6*72 + 1*80 + 2*77 + 0*9 + 3*100 = 432 + 80 + 154 + 0 + 300 = 966 (too low)\nKeeping [7, 1, 2, 0, 4]: 7*72 + 1*80 + 2*77 + 0*9 + 4*100 = 504 + 80 + 154 + 0 + 400 = 1138 (still too low)\nKeeping [7, 2, 3, 0, 4]: 7*72 + 2*80 + 3*77 + 0*9 + 4*100 = 504 + 160 + 231 + 0 + 400 = 1295\nKeeping [8, 2, 3, 0, 4]: 8*72 + 2*80 + 3*77 + 0*9 + 4*100 = 576 + 160 + 231 + 0 + 400 = 1367\nKeeping [7, 2, 3, 0, 5]: 7*72 + 2*80 + 3*77 + 0*9 + 5*100 = 504 + 160 + 231 + 0 + 500 = 1395.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 344. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 846 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 93. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 93. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 870 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 1, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    28 x 0 + 77 x 1 + 15 x 1 + 76 x 0 + 94 x 0\n    which is 92 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 93. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

I will offer a counteroffer which gives away some of each item type, but attempts to keep most of items 3 and 5.\n\n    Let's try giving Player 2: 3 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n    This means I keep: 3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 5 units of item 5.\n    My value would be:\n    3 * 15 + 2 * 60 + 3 * 83 + 3 * 45 + 5 * 95 = 45 + 120 + 249 + 135 + 475 = 1024.\n    This is much lower than my outside offer, so I need to improve this.\n\n    Let's try giving Player 2: 2 units of item 1, 0 unit of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n    This means I keep: 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 6 units of item 5.\n    My value would be:\n    4 * 15 + 3 * 60 + 4 * 83 + 4 * 45 + 6 * 95 = 60 + 180 + 332 + 180 + 570 = 1322.\n    This is still low, relative to my outside option.\n\n    Let's try giving Player 2: 1 unit of item 1, 0 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n    This means I keep: 5 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 7 units of item 5.\n    My value would be:\n    5 * 15 + 3 * 60 + 5 * 83 + 5 * 45 + 7 * 95 = 75 + 180 + 415 + 225 + 665 = 1560.\n\n    This is very close to my outside offer. I will try giving Player 2: 0 unit of item 1, 0 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 unit of item 5.\n    This means I keep: 6 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 8 units of item 5.\n    My value would be:\n    6 * 15 + 3 * 60 + 5 * 83 + 5 * 45 + 8 * 95 = 90 + 180 + 415 + 225 + 760 = 1670.\n\n    So let's offer nothing of each item. This is acceptable, and also might make Player 2 think about what they really value.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

                    "response": "To make a decision about my action, let's go through the steps outlined:\n\n### 1) Analyze the Current Situation:\n\n- **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 54.\n- **Values of the Items:**\n  - Item 1: 91\n  - Item 2: 61\n  - Item 3: 2\n  - Item 4: 33\n  - Item 5: 50\n- **Total Pool of Items:**\n  - Item 1: 6 units\n  - Item 2: 3 units\n  - Item 3: 5 units\n  - Item 4: 5 units\n  - Item 5: 8 units\n- **Discount Factor Influence:** Since we are in Round 1, the discount factor (gamma = 0.98) does not apply yet, as it affects only the value in future rounds. The present value is unaffected by it.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n\n- **Current Offer:** Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], meaning they keep everything. The value of this offer to me is 0, which is less than my outside offer (54). Hence, this is not a good offer for me.\n  \n- **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to create a counteroffer that exceeds the value of my outside offer (54) and potentially incentivizes Player 1 to accept it.\n\n  Let's calculate the total value if I keep certain items:\n  - If I keep all units, my total value is: \n    - \\(6 \\times 91 + 3 \\times 61 + 5 \\times 2 + 5 \\times 33 + 8 \\times 50 = 546 + 183 + 10 + 165 + 400 = 1304\\)\n\n  I should aim to at least retain enough units to exceed the value of 54.\n\n### Crafting a Counteroffer:\n\nTo ensure my counteroffer is appealing but also good for me, let's try offering:\n\n- I offer Player 1 a reasonable share that could potentially intrigue them. For example:\n  - Give Player 1: \n    - 1 unit of Item 1\n    - 1 unit of Item 2\n    - 3 units of Item 3 (since Item 3 is least valuable to me)\n    - 1 unit of Item 4\n    - 4 units of Item 5\n\n### Calculate My Value for This Counteroffer:\n\n- My new quantities:\n  - Item 1: 5 units \u2192 \\(5 \\times 91 = 455\\)\n  - Item 2: 2 units \u2192 \\(2 \\times 61 = 122\\)\n  - Item 3: 2 units \u2192 \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\)\n  - Item 4: 4 units \u2192 \\(4 \\times 33 = 132\\)\n  - Item 5: 4 units \u2192 \\(4 \\times 50 = 200\\)\n\nTotal Value = 455 + 122 + 4 + 132 + 200 = 913\n\n913 is significantly greater than my outside offer value of 54, making this a suitable counteroffer without falling into any of the stipulated mistakes.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision:\n\nGiven that my proposed counteroffer significantly exceeds my outside offer and offers a fair division, it is optimal to make this counteroffer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 3, 1, 4]}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

In general, it is better to secure a deal earlier if it is more beneficial than your outside offer.\n\n### 2) Assess the value of offers:\n- **For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?**\n  - Current offer [1, 1, 0, 0, 0] gives you:\n    - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 91 = 91\n    - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 61 = 61\n    - 0 units of item 3 = 0\n    - 0 units of item 4 = 0\n    - 0 units of item 5 = 0\n  - Total value = 91 + 61 = 152\n  - Since it is round 2, the value is: 152 \u00d7 0.98^(2-1) = 149.04\n\n- **Compare the value of the current offer to my outside offer value:**\n  - The current offer value of 149.04 is much higher than your outside offer value of 54.\n\n### 3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n- **Should I accept the current offer?**\n  - Yes, the current offer is significantly better than the outside offer of 54.\n\n- **Should I walk away and take my outside offer?**\n  - No, accepting the current offer is more advantageous.\n\n- **Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?**\n  - No need to counteroffer, as the current offer is already very favorable.\n\nBased on the analysis above, the optimal action is to accept the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

Your value would be:\n    65 x 1 + 93 x 0 + 94 x 0 + 5 x 0 + 21 x 1\n    which is 86 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 88. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

The discount factor slightly reduces the value of future offers, making earlier, good offers more attractive.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   Current offer: There is no current offer.\n*   Potential counteroffers: I need to propose an offer that gives Player 2 some items while leaving me with enough value to exceed my outside offer of 88.

I want to propose an offer that is likely to be accepted in a few rounds but also leaves me with a good portion of the items. I will start by offering a relatively small amount to the other player, focusing on the less valuable items.\n\nLet's try offering Player 2: 2 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4 and 1 unit of item 5.\n\nMy value would be:\n\n*   Item 1: (7-2) * 65 = 5 * 65 = 325\n*   Item 2: (2-0) * 93 = 2 * 93 = 186\n*   Item 3: (1-0) * 94 = 1 * 94 = 94\n*   Item 4: (5-2) * 5 = 3 * 5 = 15\n*   Item 5: (2-1) * 21 = 1 * 21 = 21\n\nTotal Value: 325 + 186 + 94 + 15 + 21 = 641\n\nSince 641 is much larger than 88, this seems like a good start.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 0, 2, 1]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 662. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 900 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

However, such an offer would likely be seen as too aggressive.\n\nLet's propose a balanced counteroffer that exceeds my outside offer and could be acceptable:\n\n- Keep: 7 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5\n- Offer to Player 1: 0 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5\n\nValue calculation for my keeping:\n- 7 units of item 1 = 7 \u00d7 97 = 679\n- 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 7 = 0\n- 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 88 = 0\n- 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195\n- 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 43 = 43\n- Total value = 679 + 0 + 0 + 195 + 43 = 917\n\nThis offer gives me a total value of 917, which exceeds my outside offer.

This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.98 times its face value to me. Since we are in round 2, any accepted offer is discounted by 0.98.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer (to me):** [0, 2, 1, 2, 1]\n\n    *   Value of current offer: (0 * 65) + (2 * 93) + (1 * 94) + (2 * 5) + (1 * 21) = 0 + 186 + 94 + 10 + 21 = 311\n    *   Discounted value of current offer: 311 * 0.98 = 304.78\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The discounted value of the current offer (304.78) is significantly higher than my outside offer (88).\n\n*   **Consider a possible better counteroffer**:\n    I have item values of 65, 93, 94, 5, 21 and a total of 7, 2, 1, 5, 2 items respectively. If I accepted the current offer I would have 0 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 2 of item 4 and 1 of item 5 for a discounted value of 304.78.\n    That means I keep 7 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 3 of item 4 and 1 of item 5.\n\n    Consider the opposite. If I offered [7, 0, 0, 3, 1] to Player 2.\n    That would mean I keep [0, 2, 1, 2, 1], which has a value to me of 311.\n    The discounted value is 304.78\n\n    If I offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] to player 2, then I keep [7, 2, 1, 5, 2]\n    The value of this is:\n    7 * 65 + 2 * 93 + 1 * 94 + 5 * 5 + 2 * 21 = 455 + 186 + 94 + 25 + 42 = 802\n    Discounted value is 802 * 0.98 = 785.96\n    This is much higher than the current offer.\n\n    Therefore it makes sense for me to offer a counteroffer, aiming to get as much of the items as possible.\n    However, it is probably best to accept the current offer, as it would likely be rejected if I asked for everything.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The discounted value of accepting the current offer (304.78) is much greater than my outside offer (88).

This means that accepting an offer in a later round is slightly less valuable than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   There is no current offer on the table.\n*   I need to formulate a counteroffer. Let's consider a few potential divisions and their values to me:\n\n    *   **Offer 1: Giving the other player half of everything (rounded down where necessary):**\n        Offer to Player 2: [2, 1, 1, 2, 2]\n        Remaining for me: [3, 2, 2, 3, 2]\n        My value: (3 * 18) + (2 * 69) + (2 * 54) + (3 * 57) + (2 * 69) = 54 + 138 + 108 + 171 + 138 = 609\n        This is greater than my outside offer of 430.\n\n    *   **Offer 2: Giving the other player slightly more, targeting a value closer to my outside offer (but still above):**\n        Offer to Player 2: [3, 2, 2, 3, 3]\n        Remaining for me: [2, 1, 1, 2, 1]\n        My value: (2 * 18) + (1 * 69) + (1 * 54) + (2 * 57) + (1 * 69) = 36 + 69 + 54 + 114 + 69 = 342\n        This is LESS than my outside offer of 430. This is Mistake #2.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Since there's no current offer, I need to make an initial offer. I want to start with an offer that is beneficial to me but also leaves room for negotiation. Offer 1 seems like a good starting point, as it provides me with a value well above my outside offer while still giving the other player a substantial amount.\n\nTherefore, I will make the following counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 1, 2, 2]}\n```",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 1069. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1069. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 825 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 1, 2, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 1, 2, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Let's analyze the current situation step-by-step:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n   - **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 1069.\n   \n   - **Values of the Items:**\n     - Item 1: 99 per unit\n     - Item 2: 54 per unit\n     - Item 3: 33 per unit\n     - Item 4: 16 per unit\n     - Item 5: 73 per unit\n\n   - **Total Pool of Items:**\n     - Item 1: 5 units\n     - Item 2: 3 units\n     - Item 3: 3 units\n     - Item 4: 5 units\n     - Item 5: 4 units\n\n   - **Discount Factor Influence:**\n     - The discount factor gamma = 0.98 means that waiting for future offers reduces the current value of the negotiation outcome. The value of accepting a current offer gets discounted less if accepted early.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current Offer on the Table: [2, 1, 1, 2, 2]**\n     - Value calculation if I accept it:\n       - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 99 = 198\n       - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 54 = 54\n       - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 33 = 33\n       - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 16 = 32\n       - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 73 = 146\n       - Total value = 198 + 54 + 33 + 32 + 146 = 463\n\n   - **Comparison with Outside Offer:**\n     - The current offer has a total value of 463, which is much less than my outside offer value of 1069. Therefore, accepting the current offer would be a mistake as it falls under Mistake 4 (Accepting an offer worse for me than my outside offer).\n\n3) **Decision Making:**\n\n   - **Accept the Current Offer?** No, as it is worse than my outside offer.\n   \n   - **Walk Away?** It would be better than accepting the current offer, but let's first consider a potential counteroffer to maximize my outcome.\n   \n   - **Propose a Specific Counteroffer:**\n     - A potential counteroffer would aim to exceed my outside offer value of 1069. One way is to keep higher value items for myself. Here's a calculated proposal:\n       - Keep most of item 1, 2, and 5, which I value highly.\n       - Possible Offer to Player 1: [1, 1, 2, 3, 1] (I keep [4, 2, 1, 2, 3])\n         - Value calculation if I keep [4, 2, 1, 2, 3]:\n           - 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 99 = 396\n           - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 54 = 108\n           - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 33 = 33\n           - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 16 = 32\n           - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219\n           - Total value = 396 + 108 + 33 + 32 + 219 = 788\n\n   - Since the highest value from a reasonable counteroffer (788) is still below my outside offer value of 1069, I should choose to walk away unless I can reasonably predict Player 1 will make a significantly better offer next round.\n\nGiven these considerations, the best action is to walk away, as any reasonable counteroffer within my interests does not surpass my outside offer value. \n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Since this is round 2, we compute the value as the outcome multiplied by \\( \\gamma^{(2-1)} \\) or 0.98.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n1. **Current Offer**: [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n   - Value from current offer:\n     - 0 units of item 1 = 0\n     - 0 units of item 2 = 0\n     - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 7 = 7\n     - 0 units of item 4 = 0\n     - 0 units of item 5 = 0\n   - Total value before discount = 7\n   - Discounted value = 7 \u00d7 0.98 = 6.86\n\n2. **Evaluate My Previous Offer**: [2, 1, 4, 1, 2]:\n   - Value for me:\n     - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 84 = 168\n     - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 97 = 97\n     - 4 units of item 3 = 4 \u00d7 7 = 28\n     - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 13 = 13\n     - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 45 = 90\n   - Total value = 168 + 97 + 28 + 13 + 90 = 396\n   - Discounted value (if accepted in round 2) = 396 \u00d7 0.98 = 388.08\n\n3. **Evaluate New Potential Offer**:\n   - I need a counteroffer where my value is greater than my outside offer value of 465.\n\n### Step 3: Decision Making\n\n- **Current Offer**: Accepting the current offer valued at 6.86 is worse than my outside offer (Mistake 4). Hence, I should not accept this.\n\n- **Potential Offers**: Any reasonable offer must yield a discounted value greater than my outside offer (465) to avoid Mistake 2.\n\n- **Given Constraints**: With one more round left, I can propose a counteroffer that maximizes retained value while being acceptable. I should offer minimal units to Player 1 that improve my value above my outside offer or maintain my previous strategy to reach an acceptable outcome.\n\nGiven these considerations, a viable strategy is to propose an offer that prioritizes items of highest personal value. Given that retaining my offer [2, 1, 4, 1, 2] yields a high value and is yet to be specifically refused, I will revert to this division. It's important to protect my interest as we're just about to enter the final round.\n\nTherefore, my action is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 4, 1, 2]}\n```\n\nThis proposal is designed to safeguard my interests while remaining open to potential acceptance by Player 1.",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 652. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 652. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 660 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 4, 3, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    22 x 0 + 39 x 3 + 80 x 4 + 56 x 3 + 23 x 2\n    which is 651 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 652. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 1, 4, 1, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [2, 1, 4, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 4, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\n1) **Current Situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 652\n*   My item values: item 1 = 22, item 2 = 39, item 3 = 80, item 4 = 56, item 5 = 23\n*   Total items: item 1 = 4, item 2 = 5, item 3 = 5, item 4 = 3, item 5 = 3\n*   Discount factor: 0.98. Since this is round 3, the discount factor is 0.98^(3-1) = 0.98^2 = 0.9604\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [2, 1, 4, 1, 2]. This means they keep 4-2=2 of item 1, 5-1=4 of item 2, 5-4=1 of item 3, 3-1=2 of item 4, and 3-2=1 of item 5. My value if I accept this offer is:\n    *   2 * 22 + 1 * 39 + 4 * 80 + 1 * 56 + 2 * 23 = 44 + 39 + 320 + 56 + 46 = 505\n    *   Discounted value: 505 * 0.9604 = 485.002\n\n*   **Compare to outside offer:** My outside offer is 652. Accepting the current offer yields 485.002, which is much lower than my outside offer.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Let's explore some counteroffers. I need to keep enough items to get a value greater than 652. Since this is the last round, any counteroffer from Player 2 will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    Let's start by considering an offer where I give away as little as possible. I'll start by offering the other player nothing.\n\n    *   Offer: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] to Player 2\n    *   I keep: [4, 5, 5, 3, 3]\n    *   My value: 4 * 22 + 5 * 39 + 5 * 80 + 3 * 56 + 3 * 23 = 88 + 195 + 400 + 168 + 69 = 920\n    *   Discounted value: 920 * 0.9604 = 883.568\n\n    This looks much better. Now, let's see if I can offer Player 2 *something* without dropping below my outside offer. I need to give away items of low value to me. I'll start with item 5.\n\n    *   Offer: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1] to Player 2\n    *   I keep: [4, 5, 5, 3, 2]\n    *   My value: 4 * 22 + 5 * 39 + 5 * 80 + 3 * 56 + 2 * 23 = 88 + 195 + 400 + 168 + 46 = 897\n    *   Discounted value: 897 * 0.9604 = 861.4788\n\n    That's still way better than my outside offer. Let's try to offer another unit of item 5.\n\n    *   Offer: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2] to Player 2\n    *   I keep: [4, 5, 5, 3, 1]\n    *   My value: 4 * 22 + 5 * 39 + 5 * 80 + 3 * 56 + 1 * 23 = 88 + 195 + 400 + 168 + 23 = 874\n    *   Discounted value: 874 * 0.9604 = 839.39\n\n    Still better than my outside offer. Let's try to offer all units of item 5\n\n    *   Offer: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3] to Player 2\n    *   I keep: [4, 5, 5, 3, 0]\n    *   My value: 4 * 22 + 5 * 39 + 5 * 80 + 3 * 56 + 0 * 23 = 88 + 195 + 400 + 168 + 0 = 851\n    *   Discounted value: 851 * 0.9604 = 817.3004\n\n    Still better than my outside offer. Let's try adding one unit of item 1:\n\n    *   Offer: [1, 0, 0, 0, 3] to Player 2\n    *   I keep: [3, 5, 5, 3, 0]\n    *   My value: 3 * 22 + 5 * 39 + 5 * 80 + 3 * 56 + 0 * 23 = 66 + 195 + 400 + 168 + 0 = 829\n    *   Discounted value: 829 * 0.9604 = 796.1716\n\n    Let's try adding one unit of item 2:\n\n    *   Offer: [0, 1, 0, 0, 3] to Player 2\n    *   I keep: [4, 4, 5, 3, 0]\n    *   My value: 4 * 22 + 4 * 39 + 5 * 80 + 3 * 56 + 0 * 23 = 88 + 156 + 400 + 168 + 0 = 812\n    *   Discounted value: 812 * 0.9604 = 780.0448\n\n    Let's try adding one unit of item 4:\n\n    *   Offer: [0, 0, 0, 1, 3] to Player 2\n    *   I keep: [4, 5, 5, 2, 0]\n    *   My value: 4 * 22 + 5 * 39 + 5 * 80 + 2 * 56 + 0 * 23 = 88 + 195 + 400 + 112 + 0 = 795\n    *   Discounted value: 795 * 0.9604 = 763.518\n\n    It seems like offering items of values 1 and 2 will decrease my valuation more than any benefit of having player 2 potentially accept.\n    It is very unlikely player 2 will accept a higher offer than what they previously put on the table.\n    So, with a little more confidence than round 1, I will offer the lowest I can, which is to give away all units of item 5.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\nSince the discounted value of the current offer (485.002) is far lower than my outside offer (652), I should not accept. I will make a counteroffer that maximizes my value while giving Player 2 a minimal amount.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 3]}\n```",

The value of accepting the current offer is not discounted in round 1.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the value of offers\n\n- **Value of Current Offer** ([0, 2, 1, 2, 1]):\n  - Item 1: 0 x 77 = 0\n  - Item 2: 2 x 37 = 74\n  - Item 3: 1 x 60 = 60\n  - Item 4: 2 x 97 = 194\n  - Item 5: 1 x 86 = 86\n  - Total Value = 0 + 74 + 60 + 194 + 86 = 414\n\n- **Comparison of Current Offer Value to Outside Offer**:\n  My value from the current offer (414) is significantly lower than my outside offer (1022).\n\n### Step 3: Make a decision based on the analysis\n\n- **Current Offer**: The current offer is much worse than my outside offer; I should not accept it.\n- **Walking Away**: Walking away guarantees me my outside offer value of 1022.\n- **Counteroffer Consideration**: I must ensure that any counteroffer I propose offers me a value greater than 1022 after any potential discount in future rounds.\n\nSince it is round 1 and the other player's offer is significantly lower than my outside offer, I will propose a counteroffer that attempts to secure a value higher than 1022. Considering there are no penalties or discounts in immediate terms for the current proposal, I will aim for a counteroffer that yields a decent negotiation without breaking the fundamental rules of the game.\n\n#### Constructing a Counteroffer\nBased on my values, it's strategic to keep the highly valued items, especially item 4, which has an extremely high value to me.\n\nA potential counteroffer:\n- Item 1: Offer 0 (I keep all 2)\n- Item 2: Offer 3 (I keep 2)\n- Item 3: Offer 1 (I keep 3)\n- Item 4: Offer 2 (I keep 4)\n- Item 5: Offer 1 (I keep 2)\n\nNow, calculating the value for me:\n- Item 1: 2 x 77 = 154\n- Item 2: 2 x 37 = 74\n- Item 3: 3 x 60 = 180\n- Item 4: 4 x 97 = 388\n- Item 5: 2 x 86 = 172\n- Total Value = 154 + 74 + 180 + 388 + 172 = 968\n\nSince 968 is still below 1022, I need to adjust. One potential solution could be to further reduce giving away highly valuable items, particularly item 4. \n\n**Revised Counteroffer**:\n- Item 1: Offer 0 (I keep all 2)\n- Item 2: Offer 3 (I keep 2)\n- Item 3: Offer 1 (I keep 3)\n- Item 4: Offer 1 (I keep 5)\n- Item 5: Offer 1 (I keep 2)\n\nValue for me:\n- Item 1: 2 x 77 = 154\n- Item 2: 2 x 37 = 74\n- Item 3: 3 x 60 = 180\n- Item 4: 5 x 97 = 485\n- Item 5: 2 x 86 = 172\n- Total Value = 154 + 74 + 180 + 485 + 172 = 1065\n\nGiven that 1065 is above 1022, this counteroffer is appropriate. \n\nI'll go ahead with this counteroffer ensuring it respects my outside offer and avoids the negotiation mistakes.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 1, 1, 1]}",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and decide on the best action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 706\n*   **My item values:** item 1: 74, item 2: 53, item 3: 72, item 4: 81, item 5: 32\n*   **Total item pool:** item 1: 2, item 2: 5, item 3: 4, item 4: 6, item 5: 3\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.98. This means that accepting an offer in round 2 is worth 0.98 times the face value of the offer.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** [0, 3, 1, 1, 1] (This is what Player 2 is offering *me*).\n    This means I get:\n    *   0 units of item 1\n    *   3 units of item 2\n    *   1 unit of item 3\n    *   1 unit of item 4\n    *   1 unit of item 5\n\n    So, my value if I accept the current offer is:\n    (0 * 74) + (3 * 53) + (1 * 72) + (1 * 81) + (1 * 32) = 0 + 159 + 72 + 81 + 32 = 344\n    Considering the discount factor: 344 * 0.98 = 337.12. This is much less than my outside offer of 706.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer, considering the discount factor. Let's consider keeping all items for myself.\n    That would mean offering Player 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    My value in this case would be: (2 * 74) + (5 * 53) + (4 * 72) + (6 * 81) + (3 * 32) = 148 + 265 + 288 + 486 + 96 = 1283\n    Discounted value is 1283 * 0.98 = 1257.34.\n\nLet's try another offer. Player 2 offered me [0, 3, 1, 1, 1]. In round 1 I offered [0, 2, 1, 2, 1]. Let's offer [0, 2, 1, 2, 1] again.\n\n*   If I offer [0, 2, 1, 2, 1] to Player 2, I keep:\n    *   2 - 0 = 2 units of item 1\n    *   5 - 2 = 3 units of item 2\n    *   4 - 1 = 3 units of item 3\n    *   6 - 2 = 4 units of item 4\n    *   3 - 1 = 2 units of item 5\n    My value is: (2 * 74) + (3 * 53) + (3 * 72) + (4 * 81) + (2 * 32) = 148 + 159 + 216 + 324 + 64 = 911\n    Discounted value is 911 * 0.98 = 892.78. This is greater than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is worth 337.12, which is less than my outside offer of 706.\n*   Offering [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] yields a discounted value of 1257.34.\n*   Offering [0, 2, 1, 2, 1] again yields a discounted value of 892.78.\n*   I should not accept the current offer.\n*   I should not walk away yet.\n*   I should propose the counteroffer [0, 2, 1, 2, 1]\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 1, 2, 1]}\n```",

                    "response": "To determine my action, I'll break down the situation step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1 - Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **My Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer value is 1022.\n- **Values of Items to Me**:\n  - Item 1: 77\n  - Item 2: 37\n  - Item 3: 60\n  - Item 4: 97\n  - Item 5: 86\n\n- **Total Pool of Items**: \n  - 2 units of item 1\n  - 5 units of item 2\n  - 4 units of item 3\n  - 6 units of item 4\n  - 3 units of item 5\n\n- **Discount Factor Influence**: A discount factor of 0.98 means that the value of an agreement would be slightly decreased in the next round due to the discounting of value. Since it's round 2, we must consider the discount factor (gamma = 0.98)^1, which slightly reduces the value of any accepted or new offer in this round.\n\n### Step 2 - Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer**: [0, 2, 1, 2, 1]\n  - Value to Me:\n    - Item 1: 0 units \u00d7 77 = 0\n    - Item 2: 2 units \u00d7 37 = 74\n    - Item 3: 1 unit \u00d7 60 = 60\n    - Item 4: 2 units \u00d7 97 = 194\n    - Item 5: 1 unit \u00d7 86 = 86\n  - Total value = 0 + 74 + 60 + 194 + 86 = 414\n  - Discounted value = 414 \u00d7 0.98 = 405.72\n\n- **Comparison with My Outside Offer**: The current offer, even after applying the discount factor, totals to 405.72, which is significantly less than my outside offer value of 1022. Accepting the current offer would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\n\n- **Previous Round's Offer**: My last offer was [0, 3, 1, 1, 1]\n  - Value to Me:\n    - Item 1: 0 units \u00d7 77 = 0\n    - Item 2: 3 units \u00d7 37 = 111\n    - Item 3: 1 unit \u00d7 60 = 60\n    - Item 4: 1 unit \u00d7 97 = 97\n    - Item 5: 1 unit \u00d7 86 = 86\n  - Total value = 0 + 111 + 60 + 97 + 86 = 354\n  - Discounted value = 354 \u00d7 0.98 = 346.92\n\n- **Potential Counteroffer**:\n  One viable counteroffer would be to adjust the items to increase my value, potentially by reducing the count of higher valued items given to Player 1:\n  - Possible new counteroffer: [0, 2, 1, 1, 1]\n    - Value to Me:\n      - Item 1: 2 units \u00d7 77 = 154\n      - Item 2: 3 units \u00d7 37 = 111\n      - Item 3: 3 units \u00d7 60 = 180\n      - Item 4: 5 units \u00d7 97 = 485\n      - Item 5: 2 units \u00d7 86 = 172\n    - Total value = 154 + 111 + 180 + 485 + 172 = 1102\n    - Discounted value = 1102 \u00d7 0.98 = 1080.96\n\nThis counteroffer maximizes the units of high-value items I retain, ensuring my value stays above my outside offer after the discount.\n\n### Step 3 - Make a Decision\n\nBased on the analysis, I should not accept the current offer. My previous round counteroffer is lower than my outside offer value when discounted. The new proposed counteroffer value is 1080.96, which is above my outside offer.

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 1, 2, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 3, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 1, 2, 1]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [0, 2, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n   - My outside offer value is 706.\n   - My values for the items are: item 1: 74, item 2: 53, item 3: 72, item 4: 81, item 5: 32.\n   - The total pool of items is: 2 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor is gamma = 0.98. Since it's round 3, if I accept the offer, the value will be multiplied by 0.98^(3-1) = 0.98^2 = 0.9604.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer:** The current offer is [0, 2, 1, 1, 1]. This means Player 2 is offering me 0 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n   My value if I accept: (0 * 74) + (2 * 53) + (1 * 72) + (1 * 81) + (1 * 32) = 0 + 106 + 72 + 81 + 32 = 291.\n   Considering the discount factor, the present value of accepting this offer is 291 * 0.9604 = 279.5764.\n   - **Outside Offer Comparison:** The current offer's value (279.5764) is much less than my outside offer value (706).\n\n   Now, let's consider a counteroffer. The maximum I can offer Player 2 is the entire pool of items: [2, 5, 4, 6, 3]. Since it's the last round, any offer Player 2 makes is essentially a walk. Thus, I need to propose an offer that will give me value greater than 706.\n\n   - To calculate a possible counteroffer, consider what items I have if I receive [0, 2, 1, 1, 1].  This means I am offering to Player 2: [2-0, 5-2, 4-1, 6-1, 3-1] which simplifies to [2, 3, 3, 5, 2].\n   To get a payoff greater than 706, I need to make sure what I *keep* is worth more than 706. Let's consider keeping [2, 3, 3, 5, 2] for myself and offering nothing, which would mean my counteroffer is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n   Value of keeping [2, 3, 3, 5, 2]: (2 * 74) + (3 * 53) + (3 * 72) + (5 * 81) + (2 * 32) = 148 + 159 + 216 + 405 + 64 = 992.\n\n   Now, let's find an allocation that provides me a value closer to 706, since I want to give player 2 something. I need to lower my value by ~ 286. Let's give items to player 2 in order of lowest value to me: item 5 (32), item 2 (53), item 3 (72), item 1 (74), item 4 (81).\n   If I offer Player 2 one unit of Item 5, my value reduces by 32. New value = 960.\n   If I offer Player 2 one unit of Item 2, my value reduces by 53. New value = 907.\n   If I offer Player 2 one unit of Item 3, my value reduces by 72.

The value is: 1*74 + 3*53 + 3*72 + 6*81 + 2*32 = 74 + 159 + 216 + 486 + 64 = 999. This would be giving away too little.\n\n   The offer [1, 3, 2, 1, 2] to player 2 leaves me with [1, 2, 2, 5, 1]. The value is: 1*74 + 2*53 + 2*72 + 5*81 + 1*32 = 74 + 106 + 144 + 405 + 32 = 761. This would work.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\n   Since the current offer is worse than my outside offer, I should not accept. I should propose a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than my outside offer. It is the last round so I need to be careful.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items.

Hence, if we accept any offer, the value is not discounted further, as it would be multiplied by \\(\\gamma^{(3-1)} = \\gamma^2\\), but since the discount doesn't apply to my outside offer due to negotiation ending, I will not factor it into the calculation of the current offer's value.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n\n   - The current offer is that I receive [1, 3, 2, 1, 2] units.\n     - Value from 1 unit of item 1: \\(1 \\times 77 = 77\\)\n     - Value from 3 units of item 2: \\(3 \\times 37 = 111\\)\n     - Value from 2 units of item 3: \\(2 \\times 60 = 120\\)\n     - Value from 1 unit of item 4: \\(1 \\times 97 = 97\\)\n     - Value from 2 units of item 5: \\(2 \\times 86 = 172\\)\n     - Total value = 77 + 111 + 120 + 97 + 172 = 577\n\n   - Compare the total value of the current offer (577) to my outside offer value (1022).\n\n   - The current offer yields a total value to me of 577, which is less than my outside offer value of 1022.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n\n   - Since accepting the current offer gives me a value of 577, which is worse than my outside offer value of 1022, I should not accept it. This would make Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for me than my outside offer.\n\n   - Any counteroffer I make is effectively the same as walking away since this is the final round, and proposing a counteroffer is treated as walking away.\n\n   - It is optimal to choose the guaranteed outside offer instead of the current offer.\n\nTherefore, my action is to walk away from this offer as it does not surpass the value of my outside offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 2, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 2, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To make an informed decision, let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **Outside offer value**: My outside offer value is 890.\n- **Values of the items**:\n  - Item 1: 98 per unit\n  - Item 2: 28 per unit\n  - Item 3: 76 per unit\n  - Item 4: 95 per unit\n  - Item 5: 82 per unit\n- **Total pool of items**: \n  - 4 units of item 1\n  - 4 units of item 2\n  - 4 units of item 3\n  - 6 units of item 4\n  - 8 units of item 5\n- **Discount factor**: A discount rate of 0.98 reduces the value of all future offers.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer**: [1, 1, 1, 2, 3] (items being offered to me)\n  - Value of current offer if accepted:\n    - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 98 = 98\n    - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 28 = 28\n    - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 76 = 76\n    - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 95 = 190\n    - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246\n  - Total value = 98 + 28 + 76 + 190 + 246 = 638\n\n- **Compare to outside offer**: The value of the current offer (638) is less than my outside offer (890).\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nSince the current offer value (638) is less than my outside offer (890), I should not accept it. It's also not favorable to walk away right now since the negotiation could improve. Therefore, it's reasonable to propose a counteroffer that ensures a higher value than my outside offer but is still negotiable.\n\n- **Propose a counteroffer** aiming for a higher value:\n  - Let's propose the following offer for myself:\n    - 2 units of item 1\n    - 1 unit of item 2\n    - 3 units of item 3\n    - 3 units of item 4\n    - 5 units of item 5\n\n- **Calculate my total value with this counteroffer to Player 1 (who receives the remainder)**:\n  - For Player 1 (my counteroffer): [2, 3, 1, 3]\n  - My share (units kept): [2, 1, 3, 3, 5]\n    - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 98 = 196\n    - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 28 = 28\n    - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228\n    - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285\n    - 5 units of item 5 = 5 \u00d7 82 = 410\n  - Total value to me = 196 + 28 + 228 + 285 + 410 = 1147\n\nGiven the calculations, I will make a counteroffer that benefits me more than my outside offer value. \n\n**Action**:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 3, 1, 3]}\n```",

This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 4, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    40 x 1 + 14 x 0 + 63 x 4 + 93 x 0 + 23 x 1\n    which is 315 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 316. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

This means that an offer accepted later is worth slightly less. For example, an offer worth 316 in round 1 is worth 316 * 0.98 = 309.68 in round 2.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - There is no current offer, so I can't evaluate it.\n   - I need to consider potential counteroffers and their values to me. I need to make sure any counteroffer leaves me with items worth more than 316.\n\n3) **Making a decision:**\n   - Since there's no offer to accept, I must either walk away or make a counteroffer. Walking away guarantees me 316.\n   - I need to formulate an initial offer that is reasonable and potentially attractive to Player 2, while still leaving me with more than 316.\n\nLet's try a possible offer. I will offer Player 2 half the items and see if I can tweak it from there.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 469. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1023 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 6, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    88 x 0 + 78 x 6 + 24 x 0 + 75 x 0 + 76 x 0\n    which is 468 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 469. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

This is significantly better than my outside offer of 469.\n\n    *   **Consider Player 1's previous offer:** Player 1 offered me [2, 3, 3, 1, 1]. If I had accepted it in round 1 I would have kept:\n        *   item 1: 5 - 2 = 3\n        *   item 2: 6 - 3 = 3\n        *   item 3: 6 - 3 = 3\n        *   item 4: 3 - 1 = 2\n        *   item 5: 3 - 1 = 2\n        *   Value = (3 * 88) + (3 * 78) + (3 * 24) + (2 * 75) + (2 * 76) = 264 + 234 + 72 + 150 + 152 = 872\n        *   Present value (round 1) = 872 * 0.98^(1-1) = 872\n    *   **Consider Player 2's offer (previous counteroffer):** I offered Player 2 [2, 2, 1, 0, 0]. This resulted in the current offer.\n\n3.  **Decision:**\n\n    The current offer of [2, 2, 1, 0, 0] gives me a value of 1126.02, which is much better than my outside offer of 469. Accepting is a good decision.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 353. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 353. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 705 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 1, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    37 x 0 + 17 x 1 + 99 x 1 + 5 x 1 + 77 x 3\n    which is 352 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 353. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step to make an informed decision.\n\n1. **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value: 353\n   - Values of the items: item 1 = 37, item 2 = 17, item 3 = 99, item 4 = 5, item 5 = 77\n   - Total pool of items: 1 unit of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.98. This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.98 times its face value, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 0.98^2 times its face value. Therefore, it is better to accept deals earlier rather than later, all else being equal.\n\n2. **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer: None. I have to make the first offer.\n   - Potential counteroffers: I need to find an offer that gives me a value greater than 353. I also want to make the offer attractive to Player 2 so that they are willing to accept it.\n\n3. **Develop a strategy:**\n   Since I want to maximize my payoff, I need to determine a division of items that is both valuable to me and potentially acceptable to Player 2.\n\nI will start with an offer that gives Player 2 roughly half the total value, which may incentivize them to accept the deal. The total value is 37 * 1 + 17 * 3 + 99 * 1 + 5 * 3 + 77 * 4 = 37 + 51 + 99 + 15 + 308 = 510. Half of this is 255.\n\nHere's an example offer:\n- Give Player 2: 0 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 2 unit of item 5.\n\nMy value:\n- Item 1: 1 * 37 = 37\n- Item 2: 2 * 17 = 34\n- Item 3: 1 * 99 = 99\n- Item 4: 2 * 5 = 10\n- Item 5: 2 * 77 = 154\nTotal Value = 37 + 34 + 99 + 10 + 154 = 334. This is less than my outside offer so it is unacceptable.\n\nLet me instead offer:\n- Give Player 2: 0 unit of item 1, 0 unit of item 2, 0 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 1 unit of item 5.\n\nMy value:\n- Item 1: 1 * 37 = 37\n- Item 2: 3 * 17 = 51\n- Item 3: 1 * 99 = 99\n- Item 4: 2 * 5 = 10\n- Item 5: 3 * 77 = 231\nTotal Value = 37 + 51 + 99 + 10 + 231 = 428.

I should aim to keep as much of these as possible, alongside the single units of items 1 and 3.\n\nGiven these considerations, let's draft a counteroffer where I maximize the value while ensuring it exceeds my outside offer:\n\n- My offer to Player 1: [1, 0, 1, 1, 3] (keeping items 1, 2, and most of items 4 and 5)\n\nValue to me with this counteroffer:\n- Remaining items to me: [0, 3, 0, 2, 1]\n- Item 1: 0 \u00d7 14 = 0\n- Item 2: 3 \u00d7 34 = 102\n- Item 3: 0 \u00d7 37 = 0\n- Item 4: 2 \u00d7 42 = 84\n- Item 5: 1 \u00d7 7 = 7\n- Total value = 102 + 84 + 7 = 193\n\nHowever, my calculated value is 193, which is still less than my outside offer. I must rethink the allocation:\n\nAdjusting the counteroffer, aiming for a sum greater than 217:\n\n- My offer to Player 1: [1, 2, 0, 1, 3] (keeping most valuable units)\n\nValue to me with this counteroffer:\n- Remaining items to me: [0, 1, 1, 2, 1]\n- Item 1: 0 \u00d7 14 = 0\n- Item 2: 1 \u00d7 34 = 34\n- Item 3: 1 \u00d7 37 = 37\n- Item 4: 2 \u00d7 42 = 84\n- Item 5: 1 \u00d7 7 = 7\n- Total value = 34 + 37 + 84 + 7 = 162\n\nOnce again, this is less than 217. For the sake of maximizing, my final offer will be:\n\n- My offer to Player 1: [1, 2, 1, 1, 2]\n- Remaining items to me: [0, 1, 0, 2, 2]\n- Total value (adjusted for maximizing a possibility while considering errors involved)\n\nAs iterations happen, additional tuning is necessary to ensure exceeding the minimum requirement for acceptance.\n\nLet's set a decision:\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"} - since an efficient maximizing proposal does not yet considerably surpass initially established benchmarks.",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 743. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 743. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 729 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 7, 2, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    53 x 2 + 27 x 0 + 61 x 7 + 97 x 2 + 5 x 3\n    which is 742 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 743. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and decide on the best course of action for Round 1.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 743\n*   **Values of the items involved:**\n    *   Item 1: 53 per unit\n    *   Item 2: 27 per unit\n    *   Item 3: 61 per unit\n    *   Item 4: 97 per unit\n    *   Item 5: 5 per unit\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 4 units\n    *   Item 2: 2 units\n    *   Item 3: 7 units\n    *   Item 4: 2 units\n    *   Item 5: 5 units\n*   **Discount factor:** 0.98.  Since this is Round 1, the discount factor doesn't significantly impact the decision yet, but it will become more important in later rounds.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer. I need to make the first offer.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to propose an offer that gives Player 2 some items, but also leaves me with enough value to exceed my outside offer.\n    *   Let's start by considering a relatively even split, and then adjust based on whether it exceeds my outside offer.\n\n3) **Making a decision:**\n\nSince there is no current offer, I must make a counteroffer. I need to make an offer such that what I keep is worth more than 743.\n\nLet's try offering Player 2 half of everything rounded to the nearest whole number:\n* Item 1: 2 units to Player 2, 2 units to me\n* Item 2: 1 unit to Player 2, 1 unit to me\n* Item 3: 3 units to Player 2, 4 units to me\n* Item 4: 1 unit to Player 2, 1 unit to me\n* Item 5: 2 units to Player 2, 3 units to me\n\nNow, let's calculate the value to me:\n* 2 units of Item 1: 2 * 53 = 106\n* 1 unit of Item 2: 1 * 27 = 27\n* 4 units of Item 3: 4 * 61 = 244\n* 1 unit of Item 4: 1 * 97 = 97\n* 3 units of Item 5: 3 * 5 = 15\nTotal Value: 106 + 27 + 244 + 97 + 15 = 489\n\nThis is less than my outside offer of 743. I need to offer less to Player 2. Let's try giving Player 2 very little:\n* Item 1: 0 units to Player 2, 4 units to me\n* Item 2: 0 unit to Player 2, 2 unit to me\n* Item 3: 0 units to Player 2, 7 units to me\n* Item 4: 0 unit to Player 2, 2 unit to me\n* Item 5: 0 units to Player 2, 5 units to me\n\nNow, let's calculate the value to me:\n* 4 units of Item 1: 4 * 53 = 212\n* 2 unit of Item 2: 2 * 27 = 54\n* 7 units of Item 3: 7 * 61 = 427\n* 2 unit of Item 4: 2 * 97 = 194\n* 5 units of Item 5: 5 * 5 = 25\nTotal Value: 212 + 54 + 427 + 194 + 25 = 912\n\nThis is greater than my outside offer of 743. This seems too greedy. I want to explore a middle ground. Let's offer:\n* Item 1: 1 units to Player 2, 3 units to me\n* Item 2: 0 unit to Player 2, 2 unit to me\n* Item 3: 2 units to Player 2, 5 units to me\n* Item 4: 0 unit to Player 2, 2 unit to me\n* Item 5: 1 units to Player 2, 4 units to me\n\nNow, let's calculate the value to me:\n* 3 units of Item 1: 3 * 53 = 159\n* 2 unit of Item 2: 2 * 27 = 54\n* 5 units of Item 3: 5 * 61 = 305\n* 2 unit of Item 4: 2 * 97 = 194\n* 4 units of Item 5: 4 * 5 = 20\nTotal Value: 159 + 54 + 305 + 194 + 20 = 732\n\nThis is still less than my outside offer. I will adjust it by offering:\n* Item 1: 1 units to Player 2, 3 units to me\n* Item 2: 0 unit to Player 2, 2 unit to me\n* Item 3: 1 units to Player 2, 6 units to me\n* Item 4: 0 unit to Player 2, 2 unit to me\n* Item 5: 1 units to Player 2, 4 units to me\n\nNow, let's calculate the value to me:\n* 3 units of Item 1: 3 * 53 = 159\n* 2 unit of Item 2: 2 * 27 = 54\n* 6 units of Item 3: 6 * 61 = 366\n* 2 unit of Item 4: 2 * 97 = 194\n* 4 units of Item 5: 4 * 5 = 20\nTotal Value: 159 + 54 + 366 + 194 + 20 = 793\n\nThis is greater than my outside offer.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 743. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 729 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 7, 2, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    53 x 2 + 27 x 0 + 61 x 7 + 97 x 2 + 5 x 3\n    which is 742 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 743. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 0, 2, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 0, 2, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and decide on the best action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 743\n*   **My item values:** item 1: 53, item 2: 27, item 3: 61, item 4: 97, item 5: 5\n*   **Total pool of items:** item 1: 4, item 2: 2, item 3: 7, item 4: 2, item 5: 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.98. This means that accepting an offer in a later round is slightly less valuable than accepting the same offer in an earlier round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [2, 0, 2, 1, 2]. This means I would get:\n    *   2 units of item 1: 2 * 53 = 106\n    *   0 units of item 2: 0 * 27 = 0\n    *   2 units of item 3: 2 * 61 = 122\n    *   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 97 = 97\n    *   2 units of item 5: 2 * 5 = 10\n    *   Total value of current offer: 106 + 0 + 122 + 97 + 10 = 335\n\n*   **Compare to outside offer:** The current offer (335) is significantly worse than my outside offer (743).\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to determine if a counteroffer exists that is better than walking away. I need to calculate what I would keep, determine the value of those items to me, and ensure that is greater than my outside option, also remembering that this is round 2 and the discount factor will reduce the final offer value.\n\nLet's consider several scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: I keep [4, 2, 7, 2, 5] and offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]:\nValue = 4*53 + 2*27 + 7*61 + 2*97 + 5*5 = 212 + 54 + 427 + 194 + 25 = 912. Discounted value: 912 * 0.98 = 893.76. This is a good outcome, but it's unlikely Player 2 will accept.\n\nScenario 2: I keep [2, 1, 5, 1, 3] and offer [2, 1, 2, 1, 2]:\nValue = 2*53 + 1*27 + 5*61 + 1*97 + 3*5 = 106 + 27 + 305 + 97 + 15 = 550. Discounted value = 550 * 0.98 = 539. This is still less than the outside offer.\n\nScenario 3: Aim for a value around 750\nLet's try and keep [3, 2, 6, 2, 4]:\nValue = 3*53 + 2*27 + 6*61 + 2*97 + 4*5 = 159 + 54 + 366 + 194 + 20 = 793. Discounted value = 793 * 0.98 = 777.14. This is much better than my outside option. In this scenario I would give [1,0,1,0,1] to Player 2.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is terrible. I need to make a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer. Given the scenarios, I will propose the counteroffer that results in me keeping [3, 2, 6, 2, 4] items. This would mean giving [1, 0, 1, 0, 1] to the other player.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 7, 2, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    53 x 2 + 27 x 0 + 61 x 7 + 97 x 2 + 5 x 3\n    which is 742 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 743. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 0, 2, 1, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [2, 0, 5, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 0, 5, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action for Player 1.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value is 743.\n*   My values for items 1-5 are 53, 27, 61, 97, and 5, respectively.\n*   The total pool of items is 4 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 5 units of item 5.\n*   The discount factor is 0.98.

I want to make a reasonable offer that gives Player 2 enough to consider staying in the negotiation, but also ensures I get a good value. Let's start with a relatively even split, then adjust based on how it compares to my outside offer.\n\nHere's a breakdown of making an offer close to half of each item to Player 2:\n\n*   Item 1: Offer 3, Keep 4: 4 * 64 = 256\n*   Item 2: Offer 1, Keep 1: 1 * 96 = 96\n*   Item 3: Offer 1, Keep 1: 1 * 12 = 12\n*   Item 4: Offer 1, Keep 2: 2 * 58 = 116\n*   Item 5: Offer 1, Keep 2: 2 * 87 = 174\n    Total value to me = 256 + 96 + 12 + 116 + 174 = 654\n\nThis is significantly better than my outside offer, so it's a good starting point.\n\nTo make an offer more favorable to myself, I might offer less of each item. Let's consider this distribution:\n\n* Item 1: Offer 2, Keep 5: 5 * 64 = 320\n* Item 2: Offer 0, Keep 2: 2 * 96 = 192\n* Item 3: Offer 0, Keep 2: 2 * 12 = 24\n* Item 4: Offer 1, Keep 2: 2 * 58 = 116\n* Item 5: Offer 1, Keep 2: 2 * 87 = 174\nTotal Value: 320 + 192 + 24 + 116 + 174 = 826\n\nThis is also a viable offer, which is more advantageous than the previous offer.\n\nLet's now consider offering slightly more to Player 2\n\n* Item 1: Offer 3, Keep 4: 4 * 64 = 256\n* Item 2: Offer 1, Keep 1: 1 * 96 = 96\n* Item 3: Offer 1, Keep 1: 1 * 12 = 12\n* Item 4: Offer 2, Keep 1: 1 * 58 = 58\n* Item 5: Offer 2, Keep 1: 1 * 87 = 87\nTotal Value: 256 + 96 + 12 + 58 + 87 = 509\n\nThis is a reasonable offer.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [9, 2, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    1 x 9 + 86 x 2 + 64 x 0 + 82 x 0 + 76 x 0\n    which is 181 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 188. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

This means that offers in later rounds are worth slightly less (e.g., an offer worth 200 in round 2 is effectively worth 200 * 0.98 = 196).\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer: None.\n   - Potential counteroffers: I need to propose an offer to Player 2. I want to keep as much as possible, but I also need to make the offer attractive enough for Player 2 to accept.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n   - Since there is no current offer, I will make a counteroffer. I need to make an offer that is better than my outside offer.\n   I need to be strategic. I need to give player 2 enough items so that they might accept it.\n   I will start by calculating the total value of all items to me:\n   (9 * 1) + (3 * 86) + (4 * 64) + (3 * 82) + (6 * 76) = 9 + 258 + 256 + 246 + 456 = 1225\n\nLet's consider an offer where I give away very little and calculate if I get a value that is higher than my outside offer.\nOffer Player 2 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].

It reduces the value slightly for each subsequent round due to the time factor.\n\n2) **Assessing the Value of the Current Offer and Counteroffers:**\n   - Current offer on the table (items being offered to me): [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n     - Total value for me if I accept:\n       - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 90 = 90\n       - 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 82 = 0\n       - 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 58 = 0\n       - 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 36 = 0\n       - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 5 = 0\n       - Total value = 90\n   - Compared to my outside offer, 90 is significantly less than 403.\n\n3) **Decision Making:**\n   - Accepting the current offer yields a total value of 90, which is less than my outside offer. Therefore, accepting it would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\n   - Walking away guarantees a value of 403; however, it is the first round, and proposing a counteroffer could improve my outcome.\n   - To maximize my share, a reasonable counteroffer should increase my value but not immediately give away too much while accounting for player 1's potential acceptance.\n\n**Counteroffer Decision:**\n- I want to propose a counteroffer where I still aim to maximize my value for significant item types but offer enough to player 1 to create acceptance leverage. Since my aim is to surpass my outside offer of 403, I should not give away too much of highly valued items.\n  \nLet's make a counteroffer:\n- Keep 7 units of item 1 and offer 2 to Player 1 (keeps high-value item priority)\n- Offer all 3 units of item 2 (Player 1 might value it more)\n- Offer 2 units of item 3 (balanced offering)\n- Offer 1 unit of item 4 (to improve negotiation terms)\n- Offer 5 units of item 5 (since it has low value for me)\n\nCalculating my total value with this division:\n- 7 units of item 1 = 7 \u00d7 90 = 630\n- 0 units of item 2 = 0\n- 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 58 = 116\n- 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 36 = 72\n- 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 5 = 5\n- Total = 823\n\n823 is considerably higher than 403, making this counteroffer beneficial if accepted.\n\nLet's present this counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 3, 2, 1, 5]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 715. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 999 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 3, 3, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    73 x 0 + 66 x 2 + 94 x 3 + 35 x 3 + 65 x 3\n    which is 714 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 715. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's start by analyzing the situation.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 715.\n   - My values for items 1 through 5 are 73, 66, 94, 35, and 65, respectively.\n   - The total pool of items is 0 of item 1, 6 of item 2, 5 of item 3, 4 of item 4, and 5 of item 5.\n   - The discount factor is 0.98. Since this is round 1, the discount factor doesn't immediately impact the decision, but I need to keep it in mind for future rounds.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - There is no current offer.\n   - I need to construct a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer of 715. I want to give away as little value as possible while still being reasonable enough to potentially reach an agreement.\n\n3) **Consider a possible counteroffer:**\nI will construct an offer that is good, but not so generous that I am giving away too much.\n\nLet's try offering Player 2 half of the total value, plus a little more.\n\nTotal value of all items:\n(0 * 73) + (6 * 66) + (5 * 94) + (4 * 35) + (5 * 65) = 0 + 396 + 470 + 140 + 325 = 1331\n\nLet's make a counteroffer that gives Player 2 a little more than half of the total possible value, so more than 1331/2 = 665.5. I will make a slightly biased offer to make it more appealing for Player 2.\n\nLet's consider the values per item and the number of available items to construct an offer. Item 3 has the largest value and there are 5 units. Offer 2 units of Item 3 for 2 * 94 = 188. Item 2 has the next highest number of items and a decent value. Offer 2 units of Item 2 for 2 * 66 = 132. Offer all units of Item 4 (4 items) for 4 * 35 = 140. Then give 3 units of Item 5 for 3 * 65 = 195.\n\nThe total value I am offering Player 2 is:\n188 + 132 + 140 + 195 = 655\n\nThis is slightly less than the half way point, so I'll give more of item 2. 1 unit.\n2 units of Item 3 for 2 * 94 = 188.\n3 units of Item 2 for 3 * 66 = 198\n4 units of Item 4 for 4 * 35 = 140.\n3 units of Item 5 for 3 * 65 = 195.\nTotal offered value: 188 + 198 + 140 + 195 = 721\n\nHere's the calculation for my value if the offer is accepted:\nI would keep:\n0 units of item 1\n3 units of item 2\n3 units of item 3\n0 units of item 4\n2 units of item 5\n\nMy value is:\n(0 * 73) + (3 * 66) + (3 * 94) + (0 * 35) + (2 * 65) = 0 + 198 + 282 + 0 + 130 = 610\nThat is not greater than my outside offer.\n\nTry another offer:\n\nTotal value of all items: 1331\nI will make a slightly biased offer to make it more appealing for Player 2.\n\nLet's offer Player 2:\n1 unit of item 2 (66)\n2 unit of item 3 (188)\n2 unit of item 5 (130)\n4 unit of item 4 (140)\n\nMy total offer is 66 + 188 + 130 + 140 = 524.\n\nI keep\n0 unit of item 1 (0)\n5 unit of item 2 (330)\n3 unit of item 3 (282)\n0 unit of item 4 (0)\n3 unit of item 5 (195)\n\nMy total value is 330 + 282 + 195 = 807\n\nThat offer is better than my outside option.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 2, 4, 2]}\n",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 3, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    69 x 0 + 70 x 0 + 14 x 1 + 8 x 3 + 95 x 2\n    which is 228 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 229. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

I need to calculate the value of different possible divisions to determine the best initial offer.\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** Any offer I consider must yield me a value greater than my outside offer of 229.\n\nLet's consider some potential offers, keeping in mind the mistakes I want to avoid:\n\n*   **Mistake 2**: Making an offer worse for me than my outside offer.\n*   **Mistake 3**: Offering no items or all items.\n\nI need to find a reasonable starting point for my offer. Let's try to give Player 2 a decent share of the less valuable items, but keep the bulk of the most valuable items.\nFirst, lets calculate the total value of all the items. \n(1 * 69) + (4 * 70) + (2 * 14) + (6 * 8) + (4 * 95) = 69 + 280 + 28 + 48 + 380 = 805\n\nLet's try offering Player 2: 0 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5.\n\nMy value would be:\nItem 1: (1-0) * 69 = 69\nItem 2: (4-2) * 70 = 140\nItem 3: (2-1) * 14 = 14\nItem 4: (6-3) * 8 = 24\nItem 5: (4-2) * 95 = 190\nTotal value = 69 + 140 + 14 + 24 + 190 = 437\n\nThis offer seems relatively generous, but leaves me with a significant portion of the value. Since it's much more than my outside offer, this looks like a reasonable starting point.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nI will make a COUNTEROFFER.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 1, 3, 2]}\n```",

                    "response": "To determine the best action, let's walk through the step-by-step analysis as outlined:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n   - My outside offer value is 519.\n   \n   - The values of the items involved are:\n     - Item 1: 79 per unit\n     - Item 2: 70 per unit\n     - Item 3: 83 per unit\n     - Item 4: 87 per unit\n     - Item 5: 32 per unit\n   \n   - The total pool of items: 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5.\n   \n   - The discount factor gamma = 0.98 influences the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers. If I accept an offer in this round, there's no discount to apply (i.e., gamma^0 = 1). In later rounds, my payoff is multiplied by gamma raised to (r-1), reducing the present value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - The current offer for me is [0, 0, 1, 1, 0], meaning:\n     - 0 units of item 1: 0 \u00d7 79 = 0\n     - 0 units of item 2: 0 \u00d7 70 = 0\n     - 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 83 = 83\n     - 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 87 = 87\n     - 0 units of item 5: 0 \u00d7 32 = 0\n     - Total value of current offer = 83 + 87 = 170\n   \n   - Compare this to my outside offer value of 519. The current offer (170) is less than my outside offer (519).\n\n   - For potential counteroffers, I need to achieve more than my outside offer (519).\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   - The current offer of 170 is significantly less than my outside offer of 519, so accepting it would be a mistake.\n   \n   - Walking away immediately is an option, but since we are still in the first round, I have room to negotiate a better offer that exceeds my outside offer.\n   \n   - Making a counteroffer: Ideally, my counteroffer should provide me with more than 519 in value. Let's explore an allocation that might achieve this:\n   \n     To exceed 519, a possible valuation might look like:\n     - 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 79 = 237\n     - 3 units of item 2: 3 \u00d7 70 = 210\n     - 3 units of item 3: 3 \u00d7 83 = 249 (but let's try to take less of item 3)\n     - 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 87 = 261\n   \n   Let\u2019s propose a counteroffer as follows, trying to leave some to Player 1:\n   - Offer Player 1: [0, 1, 3, 4, 0]\n   \n   What I would keep:\n   - 3 units of item 1 = 237\n   - 2 units of item 2 = 140\n   - 2 units of item 3 = 166\n   - 1 units of item 4 = 87\n   = Total 237 + 140 + 166 + 87 = 630\n   \n   This surpasses my outside offer and the proposal is reasonable leaving Player 1 some units of the most valued items.\n\nGiven this reasoning, here is my decision:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 3, 4, 0]}\n```",

For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 3, 1, 4, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    66 x 1 + 7 x 3 + 35 x 1 + 99 x 4 + 70 x 2\n    which is 658 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 659. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Let's go through the steps to determine the best course of action:\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n\n   - My outside offer value is 519.\n   - My values per unit for each item are:\n     - Item 1: 79\n     - Item 2: 70\n     - Item 3: 83\n     - Item 4: 87\n     - Item 5: 32\n\n   - The total pool of items is:\n     - 3 units of item 1\n     - 3 units of item 2\n     - 5 units of item 3\n     - 5 units of item 4\n     - 2 units of item 5\n\n   - The discount factor gamma is 0.98. At round 2, this means the present value of an accepted offer is multiplied by 0.98^1 = 0.98.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n\n   - Current offer [0, 1, 2, 2, 0] gives me:\n     - 0 units of item 1: 0 \u00d7 79 = 0\n     - 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 70 = 70\n     - 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 83 = 166\n     - 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 87 = 174\n     - 0 units of item 5: 0 \u00d7 32 = 0\n\n   - Total value if I accept the current offer: 70 + 166 + 174 = 410\n   - Adjusted by the discount factor: 410 \u00d7 0.98 = 401.8\n\n   - Compare this with my outside offer value of 519. Accepting the current offer results in a lower value than my outside offer.\n\n   - For potential counteroffers, I must propose divisions such that my value exceeds 519 when discounted by the factor of 0.98 in this round.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n\n   - Accepting the current offer gives me a value of 401.8, which is less than my outside offer of 519.\n   - Walking away guarantees me 519.\n   - I should propose a counteroffer that increases my value to more than 519 when discounted.\n\nI should find a counteroffer that maximizes my value while balancing a reasonable offer to Player 1. Here's a promising counteroffer:\n\nLet's assess the value of keeping 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5 for myself:\n- I keep 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 79 = 158\n- I keep 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 70 = 70\n- I keep 3 units of item 3: 3 \u00d7 83 = 249\n- I keep 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 87 = 261\n- I keep 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 32 = 64\n\nTotal value = 158 + 70 + 249 + 261 + 64 = 802\nDiscounted value = 802 \u00d7 0.98 = 785.96\n\nThis is more than 519.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 3, 1, 4, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    66 x 1 + 7 x 3 + 35 x 1 + 99 x 4 + 70 x 2\n    which is 658 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 659. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Let's start by figuring out a reasonable division. A completely fair division would be 1 unit of item 1, 1.5 units of item 2, 2.5 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 1.5 units of item 5 offered to Player 2. We will attempt to create an offer around this starting point.\n\nNow let's try a sample counteroffer and see if it is better than my outside option.\nLet's try giving the other player [1, 1, 2, 3, 1]\nThat means I keep [1, 2, 3, 3, 2].\nMy value would be:\n1 x 13 + 2 x 31 + 3 x 47 + 3 x 81 + 2 x 64 = 13 + 62 + 141 + 243 + 128 = 587\nThis is significantly better than my outside offer of 187, so this could work, but let's explore something that is closer to my outside offer and attempt to maximize the share.\n\nLet's try giving the other player [1, 2, 3, 4, 2]\nThat means I keep [1, 1, 2, 2, 1].\nMy value would be:\n1 x 13 + 1 x 31 + 2 x 47 + 2 x 81 + 1 x 64 = 13 + 31 + 94 + 162 + 64 = 364\nThis is significantly better than my outside offer. Let's try giving more away.\n\nLet's try giving the other player [2, 2, 4, 5, 2]\nThat means I keep [0, 1, 1, 1, 1].\nMy value would be:\n0 x 13 + 1 x 31 + 1 x 47 + 1 x 81 + 1 x 64 = 0 + 31 + 47 + 81 + 64 = 223\nThis is still better than the outside offer. Let's try to push a bit more.\n\nLet's try giving the other player [2, 3, 4, 6, 3]\nThat means I keep [0, 0, 1, 0, 0].\nMy value would be:\n0 x 13 + 0 x 31 + 1 x 47 + 0 x 81 + 0 x 64 = 47\nThis is significantly below the outside offer.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 4, 5, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 2, 4, 5, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

This means the discount factor isn't applied yet in this round.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers\n\n#### Current Offer\nThese are the units offered to me by Player 1: [2, 2, 4, 5, 2].\n- My total value for the current offer:\n  - 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 43 = 86\n  - 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 54 = 108\n  - 4 units of item 3: 4 \u00d7 68 = 272\n  - 5 units of item 4: 5 \u00d7 25 = 125\n  - 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 86 = 172\n- Total value = 86 + 108 + 272 + 125 + 172 = 763\n\n#### Comparison\n- My current offer value (763) is greater than my outside offer value (642). Therefore, accepting this offer is already better than my fallback option.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision Based on the Analysis\n- **Should I accept the current offer?** Yes, because the current offer's value (763) is higher than my outside offer (642), and there's no immediate need to seek a better deal if this one already provides a higher value.\n  \n- **Mistakes check:**\n  - **Mistake 4:** Accepting a worse offer than my outside offer. Not applicable here since 763 > 642.\n  - **Mistake 5:** Walking away from a better offer than my outside offer. Would apply if I rejected this offer, which I should not do.\n\nGiven this analysis, the optimal decision is to accept the current offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

                    "prompt": "\n    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\n    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\n    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\n    There are 3 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\n    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\n    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 101.\n    Your private values are 96 for item 1, 9 for item 2, 10 for item 3, 63 for item 4, 54 for item 5.\n    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to your total value of all items, which is 617. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 174. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 174. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 696 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 2, 2, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    96 x 0 + 9 x 3 + 10 x 2 + 63 x 2 + 54 x 0\n    which is 173 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 174. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

This means that an offer accepted in later rounds is worth slightly less than the same offer accepted now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   Current offer: There is no current offer.\n*   Potential counteroffers: I need to find a division of items that gives me a value greater than 174. Since it is the first round, let's start by exploring some possible offers and their values.\n\n3) **Making a decision:**\nSince there is no offer currently on the table and this is the first round, I need to make an initial offer. Let's start by considering a reasonable split where both players receive something. I will start with an offer to give Player 2 half the items where possible. I must also ensure that my value exceeds my walkaway of 174.\n\n**Calculations for different offers:**\n\nBefore calculating let me declare my total values:\n\n*   Item 1: 3 * 96 = 288\n*   Item 2: 5 * 9 = 45\n*   Item 3: 5 * 10 = 50\n*   Item 4: 2 * 63 = 126\n*   Item 5: 2 * 54 = 108\n*   Total Value = 288+45+50+126+108 = 617\n\nOffer 1: Give half of each item when applicable (rounding down).\n\nOffer: [1, 2, 2, 1, 1]  (Give 1 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 1 of item 5)\n\nMy Keep: [2, 3, 3, 1, 1]\n\nValue: (2 * 96) + (3 * 9) + (3 * 10) + (1 * 63) + (1 * 54) = 192 + 27 + 30 + 63 + 54 = 366.
