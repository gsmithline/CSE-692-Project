Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 332. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 675 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

                    "response": "To determine my action, I need to carefully analyze the information and consider potential offers.\n\n1) Analyzing the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value: 332\n   - My values for each item are as follows:\n     - Item 1: 69 per unit\n     - Item 2: 5 per unit\n     - Item 3: 26 per unit\n     - Item 4: 89 per unit\n     - Item 5: 36 per unit\n   - Total units available are:\n     - Item 1: 10 units\n     - Item 2: 5 units\n     - Item 3: 3 units\n     - Item 4: 5 units\n     - Item 5: 5 units\n\n   - Discount factor: If the negotiation goes to further rounds, I have to consider the discount factor of 0.98. Thus, the present value of an agreement decreases the longer we negotiate. This impacts the decision between settling now and prolonging negotiation, as the value I gain from a deal would be multiplied by gamma^(r-1).\n\n2) Assessing the value of offers:\n   - There's no current offer on the table, so we can assess potential counteroffers.\n   - To ensure a proposal is attractive, it must be worth more than my outside offer of 332.\n   - Let's consider some potential division options. For instance, I could consider keeping a majority share of the higher-value items to maximize my value:\n\n   Example proposal for player 2:\n   - 3 units of item 1 for Player 2 => 7 units for me => Value to me: 7 \u00d7 69 = 483\n   - 2 units of item 2 for Player 2 => 3 units for me => Value to me: 3 \u00d7 5 = 15\n   - 1 unit of item 3 for Player 2 => 2 units for me => Value to me: 2 \u00d7 26 = 52\n   - 2 units of item 4 for Player 2 => 3 units for me => Value to me: 3 \u00d7 89 = 267\n   - 2 units of item 5 for Player 2 => 3 units for me => Value to me: 3 \u00d7 36 = 108\n\n   Total value = 483 + 15 + 52 + 267 + 108 = 925\n\n   This offer yields a total value of 925, which is significantly higher than my outside offer of 332.\n\n3) Making a decision:\n   - I should propose a counteroffer that ensures my value is higher than my outside offer and make sure it is not worse than my subsequent offers.\n   - The calculated value from the example proposal is significantly higher than my outside offer, fulfilling criteria for a strategic offer.\n\n   Therefore, I will proceed with the following action:\n\n   ```json\n   {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 2, 1, 2, 2]}\n   ``` \n\nThis proposed distribution maximizes my value from the negotiation and fulfills the condition of remaining above my outside offer value.",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To decide on my initial action, I must analyze the current situation step-by-step:\n\n### 1) Current Situation Analysis\n\n- **Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer value is 222.\n\n- **Values of the Items**:\n  - Item 1: 34 per unit\n  - Item 2: 32 per unit\n  - Item 3: 18 per unit\n  - Item 4: 53 per unit\n  - Item 5: 16 per unit\n\n- **Total Pool of Items**:\n  - Item 1: 6 units\n  - Item 2: 6 units\n  - Item 3: 4 units\n  - Item 4: 3 units\n  - Item 5: 5 units\n\n- **Discount Factor Influence**:\n  - The discount factor (gamma = 0.98) reduces the value of waiting for future offers. If the process concludes after round 1, the overall value is multiplied by \\(0.98^{(1-1)} = 1\\), which has no immediate effect. However, the longer the negotiation takes, the more future values will be discounted.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers\n\n#### No Current Offer to Evaluate\n\nGiven there is no current offer on the table, I'll consider making an initial offer that gives a reasonable share to Player 2, maximizing my potential value while trying to make the offer attractive enough for Player 2 to consider.\n\n- **Potential Counteroffer**:\n  - Let's propose giving Player 2 a fair share of items while maximizing my retained value. I will calculate a potential initial offer:\n\nMy goal is to achieve more than the outside offer value of 222.\n\n### Proposal Calculation\n\n- If I propose this division:\n  - I keep 4 units of item 1: \\(4 \\times 34 = 136\\)\n  - I keep 4 units of item 2: \\(4 \\times 32 = 128\\)\n  - I keep 2 units of item 3: \\(2 \\times 18 = 36\\)\n  - I keep 2 units of item 4: \\(2 \\times 53 = 106\\)\n  - I keep 3 units of item 5: \\(3 \\times 16 = 48\\)\n\n- **Total Value for Me**: \\(136 + 128 + 36 + 106 + 48 = 454\\)\n\nGiven this division, the value is substantially more than my outside offer of 222.\n\n#### Offer to Player 2:\n- Player 2 gets 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n\n### 3) Decision Making\n\n- **Mistakes to Avoid**:\n  - I ensure the proposed division gives me a higher value than my outside offer (avoiding Mistake 2).\n  - Ensure the offer is not all or nothing (avoiding Mistake 3).\n  - There is no existing offer to accept or reject (Mistakes 4 and 5 don't apply currently).\n - I am ensuring I make an offer that is more valuable to me than my outside offer.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the analysis, I will make a counteroffer as an initial offer to Player 2, ensuring I maximize my value and the offer is fair enough for them to consider.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 2, 1, 2]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To make a strategic decision, let's go through the step-by-step analysis as per your instructions:\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 513.\n   - My values for the items are as follows:\n     - Item 1: 46\n     - Item 2: 33\n     - Item 3: 45\n     - Item 4: 92\n     - Item 5: 89\n   - The total pool of items is:\n     - 1 unit of item 1\n     - 2 units of item 2\n     - 4 units of item 3\n     - 10 units of item 4\n     - 5 units of item 5\n   - The total value of all items for me is calculated as:\n     - 1 * 46 + 2 * 33 + 4 * 45 + 10 * 92 + 5 * 89 = 1657\n   - The discount factor influences the present value of offers in future rounds, reducing their effective value as the rounds progress. Gamma = 0.98 means if we make a deal in round 2, the value will be adjusted by 0.98. If a deal is made in round 3, it's adjusted by 0.98^2.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - There is no current offer on the table as this is the initial round. Therefore, I must propose an initial counteroffer.\n   - I need to propose a division that gives me a value higher than my outside offer of 513.\n   - I must ensure that the offer does not violate the suboptimal moves, especially offering less value than my outside offer or making an offer worse than my previous offers.\n   \n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - The goal is to retain as much value from the items as possible while satisfying these constraints.\n\nLet's consider an initial fair offer that gives me a higher value than my outside offer and is also reasonable for Player 2:\n- I will try to keep high-value items to myself primarily and offer a plausible split to Player 2.\n\nLet's propose this offer to Player 2:\n- Give 0 units of item 1\n- Give 1 unit of item 2\n- Give 2 units of item 3\n- Give 4 units of item 4\n- Give 2 units of item 5\n\nOffer calculation:\n- My share = 1 * 46 + 1 * 33 + 2 * 45 + 6 * 92 + 3 * 89\n- My share value = 46 + 33 + 90 + 552 + 267 = 988\n\nThis share value of 988 is greater than my outside offer value of 513, making it a suitable starting offer.

Each round reduces the present value of future outcomes due to the discount, making it important to consider the time value of offers.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** None, as no offer has been made by Player 2 yet.\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** Since it's round 1, my strategy should focus on achieving a division that provides me with a total value substantially higher than my outside offer, keeping in mind the timeline of the rounds and the discount factor.\n\n   Let's consider a strong initial offer that maximizes my value:\n   - Proposal: I could propose keeping a larger share of the most valuable items for myself. For example:\n     - Items I keep:\n       - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 63 = 126\n       - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 37 = 37\n       - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147\n       - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 80 = 160\n       - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 90 = 180\n     - Total value for me = 126 + 37 + 147 + 160 + 180 = 650\n\n   - This leaves:\n     - 1 unit of item 1\n     - 0 units of item 2\n     - 1 unit of item 3\n     - 1 unit of item 4\n     - 2 units of item 5\n   - Total offer to Player 2: [1, 0, 1, 1, 2]\n\n   In this setup, I'm ensuring that my value stays above my outside offer (328) and is optimal compared to the discounting effect over rounds.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n   - As there is no current offer to accept and my outside offer value (328) is relatively low compared to the potential value I calculated for myself (650), I should make an initial offer.\n\nTherefore, my action will be to propose a counteroffer that ensures a higher value than my outside offer, ensuring a strong starting point in negotiations.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 1, 2]}\n```",

This is clearly better.\n\n### Step 3: Make a decision based on the analysis\n- **Accept the current offer?** No offer to accept.\n- **Walk away?** Outside offer is 420, and I can make a much better counteroffer.\n- **Propose a specific counteroffer?** Yes.\n\nConsidering all the above, I will make the following counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 1, 3, 4]}",

We need to adjust further:\n\n  Another possible offer could be:\n  - Offer Player 2:\n    - 0 units of item 1\n    - 1 unit of item 2\n    - 0 units of item 3\n    - 0 units of item 4\n    - 2 units of item 5\n  \n  Calculate my value:\n  - Item 1: 4 units = 4 \u00d7 57 = 228\n  - Item 2: 2 units = 2 \u00d7 87 = 174\n  - Item 3: 4 units = 4 \u00d7 1 = 4\n  - Item 4: 5 units = 5 \u00d7 58 = 290\n  - Item 5: 1 unit = 1 \u00d7 54 = 54\n  - Total value = 750\n  \n  Still lower. It's clear that as Player 1 without knowing Player 2's values, achieving 923 is difficult.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision Based on the Analysis\n\nGiven that any attempt to make a counteroffer leaves less value than the guaranteed outside offer, the optimal action must be to ensure more value:\n  \n- **Walking away from negotiations** with the guaranteed value exceeding any potentially achievable counteroffer seems prudent.\n\nTherefore, the logical action, considering the strategy:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```\n\nThis decision safeguards my values and conforms to the understanding that exceeding or meeting the outside offer with negotiations doesn't seem feasible under current constraints.",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 109. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 849 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 537. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 744 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This means the value decreases slightly in future rounds, so there's a small incentive to conclude the negotiation earlier if a favorable offer exists.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Potential Offers\n\n#### Initial Proposal Strategy\nSince there is no current offer from Player 2, I should consider what initial offer I can make that maximizes my value while aiming to exceed my outside offer value of 537.\n\n#### Calculating My Total Values for Full Sets:\n\n- All items:\n  - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 75 = 150\n  - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 7 = 14\n  - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 14 = 28\n  - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 56 = 112\n  - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 96 = 288\n\n  Total = 592\n\nTo maximize my value, I'll start by keeping the most valuable items and propose an offer that gives away the least valued ones. I need an offer that provides me with more than 537 but also gives Player 2 something reasonable to contemplate.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\n#### Initial Offer Proposal\n\nLet's construct a counteroffer:\n\n- I want to keep as much of item 5 (highest value per unit) as I can.\n- I will consider giving away more of the lower-value items.\n  \nConsidering a reasonable yet beneficial offer to myself:\n\n- Keep all units of:\n  - Item 1 (2 units, 150 value)\n  - Item 4 (2 units, 112 value)\n  - Item 5 (2 units, 192 value to Player 1)\n- Give away:\n  - All units of item 2 (2 units, 14 value)\n  - All units of item 3 (2 units, 28 value)\n\nMy total value = 150 + 0 + 0 + 112 + 192 = 454\n\nGiven this proposal is less than my outside offer value (537), I will adjust to gain more advantageous values while still making a fair offer by giving them something from high-value item 5:\n\nRevised offer:\n\n- Giving away:\n  - Item 1: 0 units\n  - Item 2: 2 units\n  - Item 3: 0 units\n  - Item 4: 0 units\n  - Item 5: 1 unit\n\nThat means I propose to Player 2:\n\u00bd * 2 units of item 5 = 96 value\n\nMy value:\n- Item 1: 2 * 75 = 150\n- Item 2: 0 * 7 = 0\n- Item 3: 2 * 14 = 28\n- Item 4: 2 * 56 = 112\n- Item 5: 1 * 96 = 96\nTotal: 150 + 0 + 28 + 112 + 96 = 386\n\nHowever, reconsidering my earlier proposal already maximizes my outcome given I have the discount factor to early concede. Let's not wait further and keep highly difficult items like 4 High-value items.\n\nLet's make the decision for an offer which is:\nGiving away: \n- 0 units of item 1\n- 3 units of item 2\n- 0 units of item 3\n- 0 units of item 4\n- 0 units of item 5\nMy expected total = 592 [back to my maximum]\n\nThis offer maximizes my holdings; hence, I propose:\nGiving out higher value minimizing my return.\n\nHence, the most viable proposal of keeping these earliest to find an outperformed sum of goodness.\n\nLet's make that offer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]}",

Let\u2019s calculate a potential counteroffer:\n\n  - If you keep:\n    - 2 units of Item 1: 2 \u00d7 75 = 150\n    - 0 units of Item 2: 0 \u00d7 7 = 0\n    - 2 units of Item 3: 2 \u00d7 14 = 28\n    - 2 units of Item 4: 2 \u00d7 56 = 112\n    - 1 unit of Item 5: 1 \u00d7 96 = 96\n  - Total value = 150 + 0 + 28 + 112 + 96 = 386\n\n  - After discount: 386 \u00d7 0.98 = 378.28, which is still below your outside offer.\n\nWe need to find a split that assures at least 547 when discounted since the next counter is likely in Round 3. \n\nLet's revise the allocation:\n\n  - Keeping 2 units of Item 1: 2 x 75 = 150\n  - Keeping 1 unit of Item 2: 1 x 7 = 7\n  - Keeping 2 units of Item 3: 2 x 14 = 28\n  - Keeping 2 units of Item 4: 2 x 56 = 112\n  - Keeping 1 unit of Item 5: 1 x 96 = 96\n  - Total value before discount = 150 + 7 + 28 + 112 + 96 = 393\n\n  - After discounting for round 3 (0.98^2 \u2248 0.9604), total value = 393 x 0.9604 = 377.5782.\n\nLet's see a better reallocation for two rounds, aiming higher to get above the 537 unadjusted value:\n\n- Potential Allocation (you keep):\n  - Item 1: 1 unit (75)\n  - Item 2: 1 unit (7)\n  - Item 3: 2 units (28)\n  - Item 4: 2 units (112)\n  - Item 5: 2 units (192)\n  - Total: 75 + 7 + 28 + 112 + 192 = 414\n\nLetting Player 2 have:\n- Item 1: 1 unit \n- Item 2: 1 unit \n- Item 3: 0 units \n- Item 4: 0 units \n- Item 5: 1 unit \n\n(Still try counter offer from fallback range):\n\nLet's try:\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 80. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 708 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Here's the step-by-step analysis:\n\n### 1) Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **My outside offer value**: 834\n- **Values of the items involved (my values)**:\n  - Item 1: 94\n  - Item 2: 19\n  - Item 3: 50\n  - Item 4: 48\n  - Item 5: 11\n- **Total pool of items**:\n  - 6 units of item 1\n  - 2 units of item 2\n  - 5 units of item 3\n  - 5 units of item 4\n  - 4 units of item 5\n- **Discount factor**: The discount factor is 0.98, meaning the value of the deal decreases slightly in subsequent rounds. Accepting or proposing a favorable deal sooner is generally preferable to avoid further reduction in value.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers\n\nSince there's no current offer from Player 2, I'll analyze potential counteroffers.\n\n1. **Maximum Value (keeping all items):**\n   - Total value if I keep all items:  \n     \\(6 \\times 94 + 2 \\times 19 + 5 \\times 50 + 5 \\times 48 + 4 \\times 11 = 564 + 38 + 250 + 240 + 44 = 1136\\)\n\n2. **Determine a reasonable division that ensures my value is at least 834:**\n   We want to ensure I don't drop below my outside offer and try to maximize my value:\n\n   For example, let's start by making sure the value I retain is greater than 834:\n   - If I offer Player 2 some items conserving an adequate amount of high-value items for myself. For instance, I'll prioritize keeping more units of item 1 and item 3 due to their high values to me.\n\n3. **Example Counteroffer Strategy:**\n   - Keep:\n     - 5 units of item 1 (5 \\times 94 = 470)\n     - 0 units of item 2 (0 \\times 19 = 0)\n     - 3 units of item 3 (3 \\times 50 = 150)\n     - 3 units of item 4 (3 \\times 48 = 144)\n     - 0 units of item 5 (0 \\times 11 = 0)\n   - Proposed Counteroffer:\n     - Give 1 unit of item 1\n     - Give 2 units of item 2\n     - Give 2 units of item 3\n     - Give 2 units of item 4\n     - Give 4 units of item 5\n\n   Verification of my remaining total value:\n   - \\(5 \\times 94 + 0 \\times 19 + 3 \\times 50 + 3 \\times 48 + 0 \\times 11 = 470 + 0 + 150 + 144 + 0 = 764\\).  \n   Adjust offer: 764 is less than 834 which means we need to make adjustment ensuring above 834 holding my value:\n   \n   Adjust Offer Strategy:\n   - Keeping:\n     - 6 units of item 1 (6 \\times 94 = 564 remains with me)\n     - 0 units of item 2 (0 \\times 19 = 0)\n     - 2 units of item 3 (2 \\times 50 = 100)\n     - 2 unit of item 4 (2 \\times 48 = 96)\n     - 0 units of item 5 (0 \\times 11 =0)\n\n   - **Proposed Counteroffer:**\n     - Give 0 units of item 1\n     - Give 2 units of item 2\n     - Give 3 units of item 3\n     - Give 3 units of item 4\n     - Give 4 units of item 5\n\n   My retained total value will then be holding:\n   - \\( 564 + 0 + 100 + 96 +0 = 760\\).\n   \n4. **Actions Comparison:**\n   - I need to either make an adjusted offer retaining more units and value or walk away as the offer still not surpassing 834.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision Based on Analysis\n\nThe counteroffer I initially structured did not surpass my outside offer. Therefore, given that any combination adjusting further still might fall under the adequate threshold due to the lack of a procedural advantageous division and value retaining goes below 834 my present optimal action would be to ensure a non-penalizing stance by opting with a secure fallback.\n\n**Action Decision:**  \nGiven the current structure and value offsets, a structured WALK serves to maintain an advantageous secure value. \n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

                    "response": "Let's go through the steps one by one:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - **What is my outside offer value?**  \n     My outside offer value is 205.\n   \n   - **What are the values of the items involved?**  \n     - Item 1: 50 per unit\n     - Item 2: 21 per unit\n     - Item 3: 100 per unit\n     - Item 4: 43 per unit\n     - Item 5: 63 per unit\n   \n   - **What is the total pool of items?**  \n     - 5 units of item 1\n     - 3 units of item 2\n     - 3 units of item 3\n     - 2 units of item 4\n     - 3 units of item 5\n\n   - **How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?**  \n     The discount factor is 0.98. The value of any agreed-upon offer is multiplied by gamma to the power (round number minus 1). Currently, we're in round 1, so the factor is \\(0.98^0\\), which equals 1.0, meaning there is no discount yet. Waiting for future rounds would decrease the value slightly.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?**  \n     There is no current offer on the table.\n\n   - **For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?**  \n     Let's consider a simple proposal where I keep most or all high-value items but ensure the overall value I give away is not too one-sided.\n\n     Suppose I offer:\n     - 2 units of item 1 (to Player 2)\n     - 1 unit of item 2 (to Player 2)\n     - 0 units of item 3 (to Player 2)\n     - 1 unit of item 4 (to Player 2)\n     - 1 unit of item 5 (to Player 2)\n\n     My value from this division:\n     - Keeping 3 units of item 1: \\(3 \\times 50 = 150\\)\n     - Keeping 2 units of item 2: \\(2 \\times 21 = 42\\)\n     - Keeping 3 units of item 3: \\(3 \\times 100 = 300\\)\n     - Keeping 1 unit of item 4: \\(1 \\times 43 = 43\\)\n     - Keeping 2 units of item 5: \\(2 \\times 63 = 126\\)\n     \n     Total value = \\(150 + 42 + 300 + 43 + 126 = 661\\)\n\n   - **How do these values compare to my outside offer value?**  \n     My total value from this proposal is 661, which is higher than my outside offer value of 205.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - There is no current offer to accept.\n   - Given that the calculated value of my potential counteroffer is higher than my outside offer, walking away is not optimal.\n   - Therefore, I should propose a counteroffer that maximizes my value and also reasonably shares resources with Player 2.\n\nConsidering these factors, I will make the following initial offer (counteroffer):\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 0, 1, 1]}\n```",

Immediate actions have a higher value due to less discounting.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer:** There is no current offer on the table, as this is the first round.\n  \n- **Potential Counteroffers:**\n  - Calculate the total value, considering potential distribution strategies, ensuring my value from the items is greater than 287.\n\nLet's propose an initial division with a relatively even split, maximizing my worth:\n\n1. **Potential Offer:**\n   - Keep 3 units of Item 1 (my value: 3 \u00d7 79 = 237)\n   - Keep 4 units of Item 2 (my value: 4 \u00d7 17 = 68)\n   - Keep 1 unit of Item 3 (my value: 1 \u00d7 67 = 67)\n   - Keep 3 units of Item 4 (my value: 3 \u00d7 53 = 159)\n   - Keep 1 unit of Item 5 (my value: 1 \u00d7 2 = 2)\n\n   - Offer to Player 2: 1 unit of Item 1, 2 units of Item 2, 0 units of Item 3, 2 units of Item 4, 1 unit of Item 5.\n\n2. **Calculation:**\n   - Total value = 237 + 68 + 67 + 159 + 2 = 533\n\nThis proposed division is much higher than my outside offer of 287, ensuring I'm not making Mistake 2, which is proposing an offer worse than my outside offer.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision Based on the Analysis\n\n- **Accept Current Offer:** Not applicable, no offer to accept.\n- **Walk Away:** Not optimal as we haven't started initial offers and my proposed value outweighs my outside offer.\n- **Propose a Counteroffer:** We make a calculated initial offer that maximizes our value above the outside offer while offering a fair potential to Player 2.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 0, 2, 1]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

We'll use the guided questions as a framework:\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n\n   - My outside offer value is 287.\n   - The values of the items for me are:\n     - Item 1: 79 per unit\n     - Item 2: 17 per unit\n     - Item 3: 67 per unit\n     - Item 4: 53 per unit\n     - Item 5: 2 per unit\n   - Total pool of items:\n     - 4 units of item 1\n     - 6 units of item 2\n     - 1 unit of item 3\n     - 5 units of item 4\n     - 2 units of item 5\n   - The discount factor (gamma = 0.98) influences the calculation of the value of the negotiation outcome, decreasing the present value of future rounds. This factor doesn't apply to round 1 since gamma to the power (r-1) becomes 1 when r = 1. For round 2, it would be 0.98.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n\n   - Current offer to me [1, 1, 0, 3, 2]:\n     - Value of 1 unit of item 1: 1 \u00d7 79 = 79\n     - Value of 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 17 = 17\n     - Value of 0 units of item 3: 0 \u00d7 67 = 0\n     - Value of 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 53 = 159\n     - Value of 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 2 = 4\n     - Total value = 79 + 17 + 0 + 159 + 4 = 259\n     - Discounted value for round 2 = 259 \u00d7 0.98 = 253.82\n\n   - The value of the current offer (253.82) is less than my outside offer value of 287.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n\n   - Should I accept the current offer? No, because the value is less than my outside offer.\n   - Should I walk away and take my outside offer? Possibly, but let's consider making a counteroffer first to see if a better division is achievable.\n   - Let's propose a counteroffer where I get an offer better than my outside offer. The minimum value I should aim for is 287.\n\nTo create an effective counteroffer, I must ensure it's more valuable than my outside offer and reasonable for Player 2 to consider. \n\nLet's propose giving Player 2:\n- 1 unit of item 1\n- 3 units of item 2\n- 0 units of item 3\n- 2 units of item 4\n- 2 units of item 5\n\n- My winnings under this offer:\n  - Value of 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 79 = 237\n  - Value of 3 units of item 2: 3 \u00d7 17 = 51\n  - Value of 1 units of item 3: 1 \u00d7 67 = 67\n  - Value of 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 53 = 159\n  - Value of 0 units of item 5: 0 \u00d7 2 = 0\n  - Total = 237 + 51 + 67 + 159 + 0 = 514\n\nThe discounted value in round 2 would be 514 \u00d7 0.98 = 503.72, which is higher than the outside offer.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 287. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 654 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 0, 2, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 0, 3, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 0, 2, 2]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 0, 3, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 0, 3, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

Since this is round 3 and player 2 made an offer, any counteroffer we make will be treated as a WALK.\n\n### 2.

Make a Decision:\n- **Comparing Values:** \n  - Current offer (adjusted for discount): 249.41\n  - Outside offer value: 287\n\nThe current offer value, even after applying the discount, is less than my outside offer value. Accepting this offer would be worse than my guaranteed fallback option (287). \n\n### Action:\nGiven this analysis, the best decision is to WALK away and take the outside offer, as it provides a higher guaranteed value than accepting the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

It is preferable to reach a deal sooner to maximize the present value of the agreement.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\nSince there is no current offer for me to accept or reject, I need to consider making an initial offer.\n\n**Potential Counteroffer Evaluation**:\n- I will evaluate a potential offer where I keep a majority of the items while still proposing a division that might appeal to Player 2. \n\nFor example, I consider keeping:\n- 4 units of item 1\n- 0 units of item 2 (since there are none to divide)\n- 3 units of item 3\n- 3 units of item 4\n- 1 unit of item 5\n\nThis means I would offer Player 2:\n- 2 units of item 1\n- 0 units of item 2\n- 1 unit of item 3\n- 2 units of item 4\n- 1 unit of item 5\n\nThe value I would get from this division:\n- 4 units of item 1 \u00d7 21 = 84\n- 0 units of item 2 \u00d7 52 = 0\n- 3 units of item 3 \u00d7 68 = 204\n- 3 units of item 4 \u00d7 60 = 180\n- 1 unit of item 5 \u00d7 35 = 35\n\n**My total value**: 84 + 0 + 204 + 180 + 35 = 503\n\n503 is significantly above my outside offer value of 289, making this a favorable potential offer for me.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\nGiven that there is no current offer, walking away is not optimal since my calculated counteroffer provides a higher value than my outside offer. Therefore, I should propose the division that maximizes my value above my outside offer.\n\nSince my calculated potential offer yields 503 for me, which is well above my outside offer of 289 and leaves some items for Player 2, it is a reasonable and strategic starting point to make this offer.\n\n**Action**: I propose a counteroffer to Player 2.\n  \n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 1, 2, 1]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

In round 3, it will be multiplied by \\(0.98^2\\).\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Value of Current Offer to Me** ([1, 1, 3, 0, 1]):\n  - Item 1: 1 unit \u00d7 60 = 60\n  - Item 2: 1 unit \u00d7 33 = 33\n  - Item 3: 3 units \u00d7 90 = 270\n  - Item 4: 0 units \u00d7 10 = 0\n  - Item 5: 1 unit \u00d7 6 = 6\n  - Total Value = 60 + 33 + 270 + 0 + 6 = 369\n  - Adjusted for Discount (0.98): 369 \u00d7 0.98 = 361.62\n\nComparing the current offer with the outside offer:\n\n- **Outside Offer Value**: 303\n- **Value of Current Offer (Discounted)**: 361.62\n\nThe current offer provides a value (361.62) significantly higher than my outside offer (303).\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nGiven that the discounted value of the current offer (361.62) is more advantageous than my outside offer (303), the rational decision in this scenario is to accept the current offer.\n\nThus, my action will be:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1584. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1230 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To make an informed decision, let's walk through the steps outlined in your scenario:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 1584.\n\n- **Values of the Items Involved:**\n  - Item 1: 78\n  - Item 2: 51\n  - Item 3: 96\n  - Item 4: 92\n  - Item 5: 93\n\n- **Total Pool of Items:**\n  - 4 units of item 1\n  - 1 unit of item 2\n  - 1 unit of item 3\n  - 7 units of item 4\n  - 8 units of item 5\n\n- **Discount Factor:** The discount factor, gamma, is 0.98. This means the final value we receive decreases slightly with each passing round, reducing our future gains compared to immediate ones. However, since this is round 1, the discount factor's impact is minimal at this point.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer:** There is no current offer on the table, so I will not accept an offer.\n\n- **Potential Counteroffers:** I should aim to make an offer where my total value exceeds my outside offer value of 1584. Let's consider an equitable split that maximizes my utility:\n\n  - **Offer 1:** Give Player 2:\n    - 1 units of item 1 (3 \u00d7 78 = 234 for me)\n    - 0 units of item 2 (51 for me)\n    - 0 units of item 3 (96 for me)\n    - 3 units of item 4 (4 \u00d7 92 = 368 for me)\n    - 4 units of item 5 (4 \u00d7 93 = 372 for me)\n\n  This would result in:\n  - Item 1: 3 \u00d7 78 = 234\n  - Item 2: 1 \u00d7 51 = 51\n  - Item 3: 1 \u00d7 96 = 96\n  - Item 4: 4 \u00d7 92 = 276\n  - Item 5: 4 \u00d7 93 = 372\n  - **Total Value:** 234 + 51 + 96 + 276 + 372 = 1029\n\nSince 1029 is less than my outside offer value, I need to keep more value or adjust offers.\n\n### Step 3: Decision\n\nSince no beneficial scenario presents itself where I would end up with more than my fallback value of 1584 by offering any allocation, I will aim higher to maintain a better position relative to the potential sacrifice in value through negotiation rounds.\n\nThis strategy avoids: \n- Mistake 2 (making an offer worse for me than my outside offer).\n  \nThus, a reasonable offer I'd consider involves maximizing my high value items while leaving minimal high-value items to Player 2. Otherwise, I can simply propose a strong initial offer in a safe position.\n\nLet's propose an initial offer to Player 2. Assuming strong negotiation dynamics, let's keep items most valuable to my score:\n\n- **Counteroffer:**\n  - Give Player 2:\n    - 1 unit of item 1\n    - 1 unit of item 2\n    - 0 units of item 3\n    - 3 units of item 4\n    - 2 units of item 5\n\n  So the offer for me gives:\n  - Item 1: 3 x 78 = 234\n  - Item 2: 0\n  - Item 3: 1 x 96 = 96\n  - Item 4: 4 x 92 = 368\n  - Item 5: 6 x 93 = 558\n\n  - **Total Offer Value:** 234 + 0 + 96 + 368 + 558 = 1256 (still lower, but advantageous starting offer maximizing control of situation). However, I will still be firm to gain the negotiation leverage from round 2.\n\nGiven all the analysis above, the action determined is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 3, 2]}\n```",

Since I'm currently in round 2, if I decide to wait until round 3, the value of any accepted offer would be multiplied by 0.98^(2-1) = 0.98.\n\n2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n   - Current offer on the table: [2, 0, 0, 2, 4], meaning I keep [2, 1, 1, 5, 4] items.\n     - Value to me:\n       - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 78 = 156\n       - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 51 = 51\n       - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 96 = 96\n       - 5 units of item 4 = 5 \u00d7 92 = 460\n       - 4 units of item 5 = 4 \u00d7 93 = 372\n     - Total value = 156 + 51 + 96 + 460 + 372 = 1135\n   - Comparing with my outside offer value of 1584, the current total value of 1135 is less than my outside offer, even more so when applying the discount factor (1135 \u00d7 0.98 \u2248 1112.3).\n\nGiven this analysis, the current offer doesn't exceed my outside offer value. \n\n3) Make a Decision:\n   - The current offer is less favorable than my outside offer value.\n   - Walking away ensures I receive my outside offer value.\n   - Proposing a better counteroffer is necessary to maximize my payoff.\n\nTo avoid any mistakes:\n- Mistake 2 would occur if I proposed a counteroffer resulting in less value than my outside offer.\n- Mistake 5 would occur if I walked away from a deal worth more than my outside offer, but the current offer isn't worth more.\n\nLet's propose an improved counteroffer, ensuring a value above my outside offer.\n\nLet's determine a counteroffer to Player 2:\n- I should aim to keep items yielding higher values considering the item quantities and my values.\n- Players typically value items differently; a better offer could incentivize Player 2.\n\nCounteroffer development:\n- Consider Player 2's initial offer and their possible high-value items. They might value item 5 highly, as they wanted 4 units of it.\n- I propose a division keeping my total value above 1584 considering discount effect.\n\nGiven all this, I propose a counteroffer:\n- Offer Player 2: [3, 0, 0, 1, 5] (keeping [1, 1, 1, 6, 3]):\n  - 1 unit of item 1 = 78\n  - 1 unit of item 2 = 51\n  - 1 unit of item 3 = 96\n  - 6 units of item 4 = 552\n  - 3 units of item 5 = 279\n  - Total value = 78 + 51 + 96 + 552 + 279 = 1056 (before discount)\n  - Adjusting with 0.98 discount, my effective value is 1056 \u00d7 0.98 \u2248 1034.88\n\nThe value is still below my outside offer but may be accepted by Player 2. To better maximize my benefit, adjust the counteroffer would be wise. However, there's a trade-off between maximizing value and succeeding in negotiation.\n\nConsidering strategic adjustments and achieving a better deal in round 3, the following counteroffer reflects this balance:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 0, 2, 5]}",

My value from accepting would be 439 \u00d7 0.98 = 430.22.\n\nMy outside offer is 55, so accepting this offer (430.22) is much better than walking away.\n\nLet me consider a potential counteroffer. Since we're in round 2 out of 3, I need to make a strong offer that Player 1 might accept. Looking at the negotiation history, Player 1 seems to be interested in items 1, 2, and 3, and is willing to give me more of items 4 and 5.\n\nMy most valuable items are 3 and 4.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "To make an informed decision, let's walk through the analysis step by step:\n\n### 1) Analyze the current situation:\n\n- **What is my outside offer value?**  \n  My outside offer value is 1262.\n\n- **What are the values of the items involved?**  \n  - Item 1 = 94 per unit\n  - Item 2 = 99 per unit\n  - Item 3 = 45 per unit\n  - Item 4 = 20 per unit\n  - Item 5 = 29 per unit\n\n- **What is the total pool of items?**  \n  - 5 units of item 1\n  - 8 units of item 2\n  - 3 units of item 3\n  - 4 units of item 4\n  - 4 units of item 5\n\n- **How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?**  \n  The discount factor, gamma = 0.98, slightly reduces the value of the negotiation outcome in later rounds. If the negotiation goes to the second or third round, the effective value of the negotiated outcome gets multiplied by 0.98 (or 0.98^2 in round 3). This means that concluding the negotiation sooner rather than later can preserve more value for both parties.\n\n### 2) Assess the value of offers:\n\n- **Current offer:** There is currently no offer on the table.\n\n- **Potential counteroffers:** To ensure that any offer I propose is worth more than my outside offer (1262), I should aim for a division that gives me at least this value after accounting for the discount factor.\n\n  Let's consider a counteroffer where I try to secure the items with the highest value per unit:\n  - Suppose I propose giving Player 2:\n    - 3 units of item 1\n    - 5 units of item 2\n    - 2 units of item 3\n    - 3 units of item 4\n    - 2 units of item 5\n\n  Calculating my total value for such a division:\n  - I keep 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 94 = 188\n  - I keep 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297\n  - I keep 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 45 = 45\n  - I keep 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 20 = 20\n  - I keep 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 29 = 58\n  - Total value to me = 188 + 297 + 45 + 20 + 58 = 608\n\nHowever, this offer provides a total value much less than my outside offer.\n\nLet's modify this proposal to achieve a total value greater than 1262:\n\n  - Suppose I propose giving Player 2:\n    - 0 units of item 1\n    - 1 units of item 2\n    - 3 units of item 3\n    - 4 units of item 4\n    - 2 units of item 5\n\n  Calculating my total value for such a division:\n  - I keep 5 units of item 1 = 5 \u00d7 94 = 470\n  - I keep 7 units of item 2 = 7 \u00d7 99 = 693\n  - I keep 0 unit of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 45 = 0\n  - I keep 0 unit of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 20 = 0\n  - I keep 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 29 = 58\n  - Total value to me = 470 + 693 + 0 + 0 + 58 = 1221\n\nThis still falls slightly below my outside offer, especially considering the discount factor if negotiations proceed to later rounds.\n\n### 3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n\nGiven that my initially proposed offer did not exceed my outside offer, and considering the discount factor, it would be optimal to propose an offer that gives me the significantly highly valued items while meeting my outside offer value specifically or greater, allowing some leeway if possible. Let's aim for a minimal viable counteroffer assuming some compromise from Player 2:\n\n- I will propose:\n  - 1 units of item 1\n  - 3 units of item 3\n  - 4 units of item 4\n  - 2 units of item 2\n  - 2 units of item 5\n\nCalculating my new outcome:\n  - I keep 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 94 = 376\n  - I keep 6 units of item 2 = 6 \u00d7 99 = 594\n  - I keep 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 45 = 0\n  - I keep 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 20 = 0\n  - I keep 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 29 = 58\n  - Total value to me = 376 + 594 + 0 + 0 + 58 = 1028 \n\nHowever, adjustment may ultimately suggest reassessing, since my value realization is incomplete with an alternative consideration for a better present simulation. As such would seem like calculating percent value overlaps with a cut for a future potential higher meet.\nYet, recognizing disciplines, adhering lack should rather consent based not on dropping value further away but simply approximation indicating acceptance, if heavily indicating only potential plausibility without engaging identity to safeguard negotiation-accompanied perspective failure contrary to arranged expected evaluations of game series moves than many strictly reduce.\n\nThus my counter should instead likely propose simply optimal impression and secure acceptance as demand indication resolved here to optimum economics.\nUltimately, evaluating majority of outcome deals and merits subject is with greater promising decision.\n\nPlease make mindful slight take into other than necessarily result equipped benefiting goals. Securely employing an immediately fitting answer resolution therefore stands until choice expiry not inevitable may apply.\n\nThe given answer in due respect for orderly inherent principle.\nLet's formally present:\n  \nI will proceed with a specific counteroffer:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 0, 0, 2]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1262. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 861 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Since this is round 2 and the game potentially goes into 3 rounds, any value we receive now would be multiplied by \\(0.98^{1} = 0.98\\).\n  \n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n- **Current Offer Value Calculation**\n  - Current offer to me: [3, 6, 3, 1, 1]\n  - My value for these:\n    - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282\n    - 6 units of item 2 = 6 \u00d7 99 = 594\n    - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135\n    - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 20 = 20\n    - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 29 = 29\n  - Total value = 1060\n  - Adjusted for discount: 1060 \u00d7 0.98 = 1038.8\n\n- **Compare Current Offer to Outside Offer**\n  - Current offer value adjusted for discount: 1038.8\n  - My outside offer value is 1262\n  - The current offer is worse than my outside offer since 1038.8 < 1262.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n- **Accept the Current Offer?**\n  - No, since it is worse than my outside offer.\n\n- **Walk Away?**\n  - Walking away guarantees me an offer of 1262, which is better than the current offer.\n\n- **Propose a Counteroffer?**\n  - I should propose a counteroffer that ensures my value is higher than 1262 while considering that Player 2 rejected my previous offer of [1, 2, 0, 0, 2].\n  - To increase my value while making it somewhat acceptable to Player 2, I should reduce my share only slightly. For example, releasing some value on the less important items for me (like item 4 and item 5) but keeping most of the higher-value items.\n  - Let's try the allocation [2, 3, 0, 3, 3] to Player 2:\n    - I keep: [3, 5, 3, 1, 1]\n    - My value:\n      - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282\n      - 5 units of item 2 = 5 \u00d7 99 = 495\n      - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135\n      - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 20 = 20\n      - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 29 = 29\n    - Total value = 961\n    - Adjusted for discount: 961 \u00d7 0.98 = 941.78\n    \n  - This is still worse than my outside offer, so I need to walk away because any other adjustments that make the offer better for Player 2 will reduce my adjusted value further.\n\n### Conclusion\nGiven the analysis, I should WALK away because the current offer is worse than my outside offer, and adjusting the units further in a counteroffer won't reach my outside offer value with the discount factor.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

If we conclude in round 1, the value isn't affected. If it extends into later rounds, the effective value of the negotiation decreases due to the discount rate of 0.98 raised to the power of (r-1).\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** None. Thus, there is no current value to assess.\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** Ideally, I want a division where my total gained value surpasses my outside offer of 1083. To evaluate this, I will consider an initially favorable offer for me and adjust later if necessary. \n\n     Let's explore a new counteroffer where I attempt to keep the majority of high-value items:\n     - Offer Player 2: 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 0 units of item 5.\n     - My retained items:\n       - Item 1: 3 units = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261\n       - Item 2: 1 unit = 31\n       - Item 3: 1 unit = 32\n       - Item 4: 1 unit = 90\n       - Item 5: 4 units = 4 \u00d7 100 = 400\n     - Total value for me: 261 + 31 + 32 + 90 + 400 = 814\n\n     Given that this value (814) is significantly lower than my outside offer of 1083, I need to consider a better balance or adjust the proposal to maximize my value.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - I should not accept any offer worse than my outside offer; no current offer is on the table, and my starting proposal gave me less value than my outside offer.\n   - Propose a counteroffer where Player 2 gets less or different configurations, in alignment with what maintains a necessary value for me.\n\n   To increase my value, I need a new counteroffer to Player 2 that maximizes my retention of high-value items like item 5:\n   - Adjusted offer to Player 2: 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5.\n   - My revised retained items:\n     - Item 1: 3 units = 261\n     - Item 2: 1 unit = 31\n     - Item 3: 1 unit = 32\n     - Item 4: 2 units = 180\n     - Item 5: 3 units = 300\n   - New total value for me: 261 + 31 + 32 + 180 + 300 = 804\n\n   Still not optimal when compared to the outside offer. Since it's challenging to reach 1083 and maintain high retention, an aggressive first offer gives a good starting position:\n\n   Adjusted counteroffer to explore:\n   - Offer Player 2: 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 0 units of item 5.\n   - Retained:\n     - Item 1: 2 units = 174\n     - Item 2: 1 unit = 31 \n     - Item 3: 2 units = 64 \n     - Item 4: 1 unit = 90\n     - Item 5: 4 units = 400\n   - Total value for me: 174 + 31 + 64 + 90 + 400 = 759\n\nGiven all analysis, offering a minor portion first could open negotiations, but the initial suggested amounts need strategic enhancement for better rounds.\n\n**Action:** \n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 1, 1, 0]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1083. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1020 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

If an agreement is not reached in round 1 and the negotiation continues to subsequent rounds, the value of any deal is diminished by multiplying by the discount factor raised to the power of (round - 1).\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\nSince this is round 1, I'm initiating the offer.\n- **Current offer value if accepted:** None yet, as I will make the first offer.\n\n- **Potential counteroffers:**\n  - I must ensure any offer I make results in keeping items that have a total value greater than my outside offer (93). Furthermore, I should aim to maximize my retained value while making an attractive enough offer for Player 2 to consider accepting.\n  \n- **Calculate potential divisions:**\n  For example, consider offering the following to Player 2:\n  - 0 units of item 1 (I keep 2 units, worth 2 \u00d7 90 = 180)\n  - 0 units of item 2 (I keep 0 units, worth 0 \u00d7 17 = 0)\n  - 4 units of item 3 (I keep 2 units, worth 2 \u00d7 58 = 116) \n  - 0 units of item 4 (I keep 1 unit, worth 1 \u00d7 24 = 24)\n  - 0 units of item 5 (I keep 6 units, worth 6 \u00d7 91 = 546)\n  \nTotal value if I keep the rest: 180 + 0 + 116 + 24 + 546 = 866\n\nMy proposed offer to Player 2 will therefore be: [0, 0, 4, 0, 0].\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n- **Accept the current offer:** Not applicable as there is no offer yet.\n- **Walk away:** I shouldn't walk away without first attempting a negotiation as my outside offer is 93, which is significantly lower than the value I can get from dividing the items.\n- **Propose a specific counteroffer:** My proposed offer [0, 0, 4, 0, 0] allows me to keep a value of 866 for myself, which is well above my outside offer of 93.\n\nGiven the above reasoning, I will make an initial offer to Player 2:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 4, 0, 0]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 683. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 993 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

I'll find a balanced division that maximizes my value while keeping it realistic for Player 2 to consider.\n\nLet's propose an initial offer where I keep a higher total value than my outside offer:\n\nPropose that I keep:\n- 3 units of item 1 (3 * 90 = 270)\n- 1 unit of item 2 (1 * 56 = 56)\n- 5 units of item 3 (5 * 8 = 40)\n- 2 units of item 4 (2 * 78 = 156)\n- 2 units of item 5 (2 * 99 = 198)\n\nThe rest to Player 2:\n- 2 units of item 1\n- 1 unit of item 2\n- 2 units of item 3\n- 1 unit of item 4\n- 1 unit of item 5\n\nCalculating my total value based on this proposal:\n- Total for me = 270 + 56 + 40 + 156 + 198 = 720\n\nSince 720 is greater than my outside offer of 683, this is a valid and strategic counteroffer to make.\n\n3) **Decision:**\nI should make a counteroffer with the division above.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 2, 1, 1]}",

Since it's round 2, any accepted value would be multiplied by \\(0.98^{1} = 0.98\\).\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer on the Table** ([3, 0, 5, 0, 0]):\n  - You receive 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5\n  - Value to you:\n    - Item 1: 2 x 90 = 180\n    - Item 2: 2 x 56 = 0 (since you get 0 units)\n    - Item 3: 2 x 8 = 16\n    - Item 4: 3 x 78 = 234\n    - Item 5: 3 x 99 = 297\n  - Total value = 180 + 16 + 234 + 297 = 727\n  - Discounted value = 727 x 0.98 = 712.46\n\n- **Comparison with Outside Offer**: The discounted value of accepting the current offer (712.46) is greater than your outside offer value (683).\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nGiven the calculations and the rules outlined for negotiation mistakes, here are the considerations:\n\n- Accepting the current offer provides a greater value (712.46) compared to the outside offer (683).\n- Walking away would yield less value than accepting the current offer.\n- A counteroffer must yield more than 712.46 (and fulfill the conditions of negotiations), but creating such an offer may be complex given the current values.\n\nGiven these considerations, the optimal action would be to accept the current offer, as it maximizes the return without risking a walk away or counteroffer that might yield less value.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",
