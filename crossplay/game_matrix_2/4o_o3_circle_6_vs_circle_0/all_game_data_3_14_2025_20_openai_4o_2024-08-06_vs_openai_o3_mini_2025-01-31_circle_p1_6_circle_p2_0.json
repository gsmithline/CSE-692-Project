Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 510. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 678 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 1, 1, 1, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    84 x 3 + 52 x 1 + 34 x 1 + 18 x 1 + 38 x 4\n    which is 508 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 510. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Analyzing various distributions:\n  - If I keep 4 units of item 1, 1 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 2 of item 4, and 2 units of item 5:\n    - Value = \\(4 \\times 84 + 1 \\times 52 + 0 \\times 34 + 2 \\times 18 + 2 \\times 38\\)\n    - Value = \\(336 + 52 + 0 + 36 + 76 = 500\\)\n    - This is less than my outside offer.\n  - If I keep 3 units of item 1, 2 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 3 units of item 5:\n    - Value = \\(3 \\times 84 + 2 \\times 52 + 1 \\times 34 + 1 \\times 18 + 3 \\times 38\\)\n    - Value = \\(252 + 104 + 34 + 18 + 114 = 522\\)\n    - This is better than my outside offer.\n\n### Step 3: Make a decision\n- My objective is to aim for an offer that provides a higher value than my outside offer of 510.\n- Based on the analysis, a counteroffer that allows me to keep a combination yielding total value above 510, e.g., [2, 0, 0, 2, 1] units given to Player 2, aligns with my interest.\n\nThus, I will propose the following counteroffer to Player 2:\n- Giving 2 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5 to Player 2.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 0, 2, 1]}\n```",

(Recall: if negotiations fail I get 436.) So I must not ACCEPT.\n\nStep 2: If I \u201cWALK\u201d I get 436. Hence, any deal I make must fetch me a payoff higher than 436 (when there is no discount since we are in Round 1). Because I value all 5 item types in total at 679, if I get a deal yielding V for my items then, using my own valuation, my share\u2019s value is\n\n\u2003\u2003679 \u2013 (value of what I give to Player\u20091)\n\nSo to do strictly better than 436, I need to ensure that the value (according to my private valuations) of what I give to Player\u20091 is at most\n\n\u2003\u2003679 \u2013 436 = 243.\n\nStep 3: I now choose a counteroffer. In a counteroffer I specify what I offer to Player\u20091, and my own allocation will be what remains of the totals. (Remember: the \u201coffer\u201d is an array where the ith number indicates how many units of item i you give to Player 1.) My idea is to \u201coffer\u201d Player\u20091 all the items that I value least so that, from my perspective, the total \u201ccost\u201d does not exceed 243.\n\nLooking at my per\u2011unit values:\n\u2003\u2003item\u20095: 17 (lowest)\n\u2003\u2003item\u20094: 30 \n\u2003\u2003item\u20092: 67 \n\u2003\u2003item\u20091: 63 \n\u2003\u2003item\u20093: 72 (highest)\n\nA natural idea is to assign all of items where my value is low. For example, if I offer Player\u20091:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 all 4 units of item\u20095 (4\u00d717 = 68)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 all 3 units of item\u20094 (3\u00d730 = 90)\nThat uses up 68 + 90 = 158 of my \u201cbudget.\u201d I can then add one unit of another item. The next candidate is one unit of item\u20092 for 67 points:\n\u2003\u2003158 + 67 = 225, which is still \u2264 243.\nThere is no room to add another unit without exceeding 243 (e.g. an extra unit of any remaining item would push it over). \n\nThus, my counteroffer is to give Player 1:\n\u2003\u2003item1: 0 units,\n\u2003\u2003item2: 1 unit,\n\u2003\u2003item3: 0 units,\n\u2003\u2003item4: 3 units,\n\u2003\u2003item5: 4 units.\n\nThen my resulting allocation is the remainder:\n\u2003\u2003item1: 5 \u2013 0 = 5,\n\u2003\u2003item2: 2 \u2013 1 = 1,\n\u2003\u2003item3: 1 \u2013 0 = 1,\n\u2003\u2003item4: 3 \u2013 3 = 0,\n\u2003\u2003item5: 4 \u2013 4 = 0.\n\nMy own payoff is then:\n\u2003\u20035\u00d763 + 1\u00d767 + 1\u00d772 + 0\u00d730 + 0\u00d717 = 315 + 67 + 72 = 454,\nwhich is above my outside offer of 436. (Also note that by my numbers, the \u201cprice\u201d I pay \u2013 225 \u2013 is even below the maximum allowable 243.)\n\nStep 4: Since the current offer on the table (worth 203 for me) is much worse than my outside option, I will counter with the above proposal.\n\nThus my answer is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 3, 4]}",

However, I already have a strong outside alternative (436) that I must beat when considering the discount factor. In round 2 the discounting is \u03b3^(2\u20131)=0.98, so any deal must give me (raw) value v with 0.98\u00b7v > 436; in other words, v should be at least about 445.\n\u2022 Looking at my per\u2010unit values (item 1:63, 2:67, 3:72, 4:30, 5:17) I get most \u201cbang\u201d from items 1\u20133. (Observe that my total for items 1\u20133 is 5\u00d763 + 2\u00d767 + 1\u00d772 = 315 + 134 + 72 = 521, well above 445.)\n\u2022 In our negotiation history Player 1\u2019s last offer gave me [1,1,0,1,2], which yields me only 194. That is far below what I can guarantee with my outside offer.\n\u2022 A natural counter is to try \u201call or nothing\u201d with items that are most valuable to me. I know (or expect) that Player 1\u2019s private values differ from mine. In particular it is quite likely that Player 1 values items 4 and 5 relatively more \u2013 they are worth little to me but may be more attractive to him. Thus a counteroffer that gives me all of items 1, 2, and 3 (i.e. I receiving [5,2,1,0,0]) and leaving Player 1 with everything from items 4 and 5 (i.e. he gets [0,0,0,3,4]) will deliver me 521 (which discounted by 0.98 becomes \u2248510.6, well above my outside offer of 436) while potentially offering him a favorable bundle from his own perspective.\n\u2022 In the counteroffer format my \u201coffer\u201d is the allocation proposed for the other player.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 1, 1, 1, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    84 x 3 + 52 x 1 + 34 x 1 + 18 x 1 + 38 x 4\n    which is 508 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 510. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    70 x 0 + 96 x 0 + 93 x 0 + 75 x 0 + 79 x 0\n    which is 0 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 16. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Offers in later rounds will be multiplied by lower factors: 0.98 in round 2 and 0.98^2 in round 3. Therefore, securing a good deal earlier is advantageous.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - There is no current offer on the table from Player 2, so I must propose an initial offer.\n   - My goal is to propose a division of items that gives me a value higher than my outside offer of 16. \n   \n   Let's calculate the value if I keep all items for myself:\n   - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210\n   - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 96 = 192\n   - 5 units of item 3 = 5 \u00d7 93 = 465\n   - 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 75 = 0\n   - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237\n   - Total value = 210 + 192 + 465 + 0 + 237 = 1104\n\nThis is the maximum value I can achieve, but it's unlikely to be accepted by Player 2. Therefore, I will propose a division that still ensures I exceed my outside offer and might be attractive to Player 2.\n\nLet's consider a balanced counteroffer:\n- Keep 2 units of item 1, offer 1 to Player 2.\n- Keep 1 unit of item 2, offer 1 to Player 2.\n- Keep 3 units of item 3, offer 2 to Player 2.\n- Offer 0 units of item 4 (since there are 0).\n- Keep 2 units of item 5, offer 1 to Player 2.\n\nValue for me:\n- 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 70 = 140\n- 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 96 = 96\n- 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279\n- 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 75 = 0\n- 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 79 = 158\n- Total value = 140 + 96 + 279 + 0 + 158 = 673\n\n673 is significantly higher than my outside offer of 16, and it offers Player 2 a part of valuable items.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - I should make an initial offer rather than walking away since it's round 1 and I can propose a fair division.\n   - Given my proposed division gives me 673 in value, which is vastly superior to my outside offer, I will propose it.\n\nMy action is to make a counteroffer:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 2, 0, 1]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 3, 2, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    34 x 0 + 33 x 0 + 50 x 3 + 81 x 2 + 52 x 5\n    which is 572 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 573. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

                    "response": "To determine the best action, let's go through the questions step by step:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 573.\n   - My values for the items are: \n     - Item 1: 34\n     - Item 2: 33\n     - Item 3: 50\n     - Item 4: 81\n     - Item 5: 52\n   - The total pool of items is:\n     - 6 units of item 1\n     - 5 units of item 2\n     - 5 units of item 3\n     - 7 units of item 4\n     - 6 units of item 5\n   - The discount factor (gamma) influences future rounds by reducing the value of any possible accepted offer due to the time factor. In round 1, there is no discount applied (gamma^0 = 1).\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Currently, there is no offer on the table for me to accept.\n   - I need to consider a potential counteroffer and calculate its total value to ensure it is greater than my outside offer (573). Additionally, it should not be an unreasonable initial offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - Since there is no offer to accept, I should make a counteroffer. I need to create an offer that maximizes my value but also stays competitive to keep the negotiation open. The objective is to propose a division of items that is above my outside offer value.\n\n   Let's propose a counteroffer where I keep certain units from each item and offer the rest to Player 2:\n\n   - Keeping 2 units of item 1, offering 4 to Player 2.\n   - Keeping 2 units of item 2, offering 3 to Player 2.\n   - Keeping 3 units of item 3, offering 2 to Player 2. \n   - Keeping 5 units of item 4, offering 2 to Player 2. \n   - Keeping 4 units of item 5, offering 2 to Player 2. \n\n   My value would be:\n   - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 34 = 68\n   - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 33 = 66\n   - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150\n   - 5 units of item 4 = 5 \u00d7 81 = 405\n   - 4 units of item 5 = 4 \u00d7 52 = 208\n   - Total value = 68 + 66 + 150 + 405 + 208 = 897\n\nSince the value of keeping these items is more significant than my outside offer value (897 > 573), this makes for a reasonable first offer to maximize my outcomes while also meeting the minimum criteria of surpassing my outside offer.\n\nTherefore, my initial counteroffer to Player 2 will be:\n- Offer [4, 3, 2, 2, 2].\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 3, 2, 2, 2]}",

                    "response": "My analysis proceeds as follows. First, I computed the value I would get if I accepted Player\u00a01\u2019s offer. Receiving [4, 3, 2, 2, 2] would yield for me:\n\u2003Item\u00a01: 4\u00b793 = 372  \n\u2003Item\u00a02: 3\u00b795 = 285  \n\u2003Item\u00a03: 2\u00b716 = 32  \n\u2003Item\u00a04: 2\u00b750 = 100  \n\u2003Item\u00a05: 2\u00b718 = 36  \nTotal = 372 + 285 + 32 + 100 + 36 = 825.  \nBecause my private outside option is 936 (with no discount in round\u00a01), accepting 825 would be worse than walking away.\n\nI therefore must propose a counteroffer that, if accepted, gives me a value at least equal to (and preferably a bit above) 936 while still offering Player\u00a01 an attractive enough bundle. My total \u201cpie\u201d for each item is fixed:\n\u2003Item 1: 6 units  \n\u2003Item 2: 5 units  \n\u2003Item 3: 5 units  \n\u2003Item 4: 7 units  \n\u2003Item 5: 6 units  \n\nSince my values for items\u00a01 and 2 (93 and 95 per unit) are high, I\u2019d like to keep most or all of these. In fact, taking all of item\u00a01 and item\u00a02 would give me 6\u00b793 + 5\u00b795 = 558 + 475 = 1033, well above 936. On the other hand, items\u00a03, 4, and 5 have lower value for me (16, 50, and 18 per unit) and are likely to be relatively more attractive to Player\u00a01 (who has independent draws from a uniform distribution). In order to \u201cpay\u201d Player\u00a01 just enough so that his bundle is at least as attractive as his own reservation value (which we assume is comparable to what he was implicitly offering in round\u00a01), I propose giving him all of items\u00a03, 4, and 5. That would assign him:\n\u2003Item\u00a03: all 5 units  \n\u2003Item\u00a04: all 7 units  \n\u2003Item\u00a05: all 6 units  \n\nNow, if I took the rest (all of items\u00a01 and 2), I would score 1033. However, to make my offer slightly more enticing to Player\u00a01 we can \u201cconcede\u201d a little from item\u00a01. For example, if I give up 1 unit of item\u00a01, then my allocation becomes:\n\u2003Item\u00a01: 5 units  \n\u2003Item\u00a02: 5 units  \n\u2003Item\u00a03: 0 units  \n\u2003Item\u00a04: 0 units  \n\u2003Item\u00a05: 0 units  \nyielding a value of 5\u00b793 + 5\u00b795 = 465 + 475 = 940 for me. This is still above my outside option of 936, while giving Player\u00a01 one extra unit of item\u00a01 along with everything in items\u00a03\u20135. (In Player\u00a01\u2019s original offer he would have retained some of items\u00a01 and 2 in his own share, but given that my private values are high for these items and since Player\u00a01\u2019s values are drawn independently, it is plausible that he has less \u201cinterest\u201d in them. Meanwhile, items\u00a03, 4, and 5 are likely to be more important to him.)  \n\nThus, I choose to propose the following counteroffer: I offer Player\u00a01 the bundle [1, 0, 5, 7, 6] (meaning Player\u00a01 receives 1 unit of item\u00a01, 0 of item\u00a02, all 5 units of item\u00a03, all 7 of item\u00a04, and all 6 of item\u00a05), leaving me with [5, 5, 0, 0, 0]. \n\nMy final action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 5, 7, 6]}",

If we go to round 3, it is multiplied by \u03b3^2.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the value of offers\n\n#### Current offer [1, 0, 5, 7, 6] (units offered to me):\n- My total value from current offer:\n  - Item 1: 1 \u00d7 34 = 34\n  - Item 2: 0 \u00d7 33 = 0\n  - Item 3: 5 \u00d7 50 = 250\n  - Item 4: 7 \u00d7 81 = 567\n  - Item 5: 6 \u00d7 52 = 312\n- Total value = 34 + 0 + 250 + 567 + 312 = 1163\n- Discounted value (round 2): 1163 \u00d7 0.98 = 1139.74\n\n#### Compare to my outside offer:\n- Discounted current offer value (1139.74) is greater than my outside offer value (573).\n\n### Step 3: Make a decision\n\nSince the current offer yields a much higher value than my outside offer, accepting it is beneficial. There is no need to walk away or propose a counteroffer when the current offer already surpasses the value of my guaranteed fallback.\n\nBased on the analysis, the best course of action is to accept the current offer. \n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 344. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 344. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 654 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    57 x 0 + 60 x 2 + 26 x 2 + 18 x 0 + 57 x 3\n    which is 343 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 344. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

                    "response": "Let's walk through the decision-making process step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **Outside Offer Value**: My guaranteed outside offer value is 344. This is the minimum I need to match or exceed in the negotiation.\n- **Values of the Items**:\n  - Item 1: 4 units, my value per unit = 57\n  - Item 2: 4 units, my value per unit = 60\n  - Item 3: 3 units, my value per unit = 26\n  - Item 4: 5 units, my value per unit = 18\n  - Item 5: 5 units, my value per unit = 57\n- **Total Pool of Items**: 21 units across all items.\n- **Discount Factor**: The value of accepting future offers decreases slightly due to the discount factor (gamma = 0.98). In this first round, it doesn't affect the decision-making as much, but as rounds progress, it will have a compounding effect.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer**: No current offer yet.\n  \n- **Potential Counteroffers**: I'll consider different scenarios of what I'm willing to offer Player 2 while maximizing my value and ensuring it exceeds my outside offer. Some calculations:\n\n  - **Keep Example Division [2, 2, 2, 2, 3]** (offering Player 2 [2, 2, 1, 3, 2]):\n    - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 57 = 114\n    - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 60 = 120\n    - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 26 = 52\n    - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 18 = 36\n    - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171\n    - Total value = 114 + 120 + 52 + 36 + 171 = 493\n\n  This value of 493 exceeds my outside offer value of 344. Therefore, this is a potentially viable opening offer.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\n- **Based on the Analysis**: I should propose an opening counteroffer that is better for me than my outside offer and is reasonable for negotiation continuation. Keeping items such that my total value exceeds 344 while leaving room for adjustment in future rounds is ideal.\n\nGiven this analysis, I will make the following offer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 1, 3, 2]}\n```\n\nThis counteroffer ensures a good starting point for negotiation, providing me substantial value while still allowing for flexibility in discussion based on the other party's potential interests.",

Your outside offer is 312. The current offer (592) is much better than 312.\n\nStep 3: Considering a counteroffer. As Player 2 you are allowed to propose a division (i.e. specify for each item how many units you give to Player 1, with you keeping the remainder). You might try to \u201cswap\u201d low\u2010worth items (from your perspective) for high\u2010worth items. However any improvement for you will come at the expense of P1\u2019s share. Since you lack knowledge of P1\u2019s exact private values (only that they are uniformly drawn between 1 and 101) you must worry that asking for a \u201cbetter\u201d split might leave them with less than what they\u2019d expect (from their own initial offer, which would give them the remaining units [2,2,2,2,3] with an expected value around 561 in total if we use a rough average of 51 per unit). In other words, a counteroffer aggressively improving your value in high\u2010value items (like items 2 and 5) might force you to reduce P1\u2019s share too far, leading to a risk they will reject and the negotiation potentially drag on (with discounting) or even end without a deal.\n\nStep 4: Decision. The current offer gives you 592\u2014far higher than your outside option. It is also immediately available without discounting. Although a creative counteroffer might allow you to reallocate items (for instance, \u201cswapping\u201d a low\u2010value unit such as one unit of item 1 for an additional unit of an item you value highly) thereby increasing your total value further, such a counteroffer risks offering P1 less than what they could get by sticking with their own initial division. Given the inherent uncertainty in P1\u2019s private values and the risk that an apparently \u201cbetter\u201d deal for you might be rejected by P1, it is prudent to accept the current offer rather than risk a breakdown or further discounting.\n\nTherefore, my action is to ACCEPT the current offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 7, 5, 1, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    94 x 4 + 52 x 7 + 2 x 5 + 30 x 1 + 84 x 5\n    which is 1200 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1201. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Therefore, achieving an agreement sooner is more beneficial.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Currently, there is no offer on the table, so I must make an initial offer to Player 2.\n   - To maximize my value, I need to find a division of items that results in a total value for me that is at least 1201.\n   - Let's calculate the total value if I keep all items for myself:\n     - 4 units of item 1: \\(4 \\times 94 = 376\\)\n     - 7 units of item 2: \\(7 \\times 52 = 364\\)\n     - 5 units of item 3: \\(5 \\times 2 = 10\\)\n     - 2 units of item 4: \\(2 \\times 30 = 60\\)\n     - 5 units of item 5: \\(5 \\times 84 = 420\\)\n     - Total value = \\(376 + 364 + 10 + 60 + 420 = 1230\\)\n\n   - Since my outside offer is 1201, I cannot propose keeping all the items (1230 is greater than 1201, but I should account for some negotiation flexibility and the perceived needs of Player 2).\n   - My counteroffer should be structured so that the value of retained items is greater than or equal to 1201, considering potential negotiation gains.\n\n**Initial Offer Strategy:**\n   - Let's try to make a reasonable initial offer by relinquishing units of items with lower value to me, ensuring my retained value remains above 1201 while providing some value to Player 2:\n   - Example counteroffer: Let's try offering 5 units of item 3 (least valuable to me) and 2 units of item 2 (second least valuable):\n\n   - If I keep:\n     - 4 units of item 1 (all units)\n     - 5 units of item 2 (7 total - 2 offered = 5 remaining)\n     - 0 units of item 3 (5 total - 5 offered = 0 remaining)\n     - 2 units of item 4 (all units)\n     - 5 units of item 5 (all units)\n   \n   - Calculating my retained value:\n     - 4 units of item 1: \\(4 \\times 94 = 376\\)\n     - 5 units of item 2: \\(5 \\times 52 = 260\\)\n     - 0 units of item 3: \\(0 \\times 2 = 0\\)\n     - 2 units of item 4: \\(2 \u00d7 30 = 60\\)\n     - 5 units of item 5: \\(5 \u00d7 84 = 420\\)\n     - Total retained value: \\(376 + 260 + 0 + 60 + 420 = 1116\\)\n\n   - Since 1116 is less than my outside offer of 1201, this offer would not be ideal. Let's adjust the offer:\n     - I will instead offer all units of item 3 and 3 units of item 2.\n\n   - New proposed counteroffer to give Player 2:\n     - 0 units of item 1\n     - 3 units of item 2\n     - 5 units of item 3 (all units)\n     - 0 units of item 4\n     - 0 units of item 5\n\n   - If I keep:\n     - 4 units of item 1 (all units)\n     - 4 units of item 2 (7 total - 3 offered = 4 remaining)\n     - 0 units of item 3\n     - 2 units of item 4 (all units)\n     - 5 units of item 5 (all units)\n\n   - My retained value now becomes:\n     - 4 units of item 1: \\(4 \\times 94 = 376\\)\n     - 4 units of item 2: \\(4 \\times 52 = 208\\)\n     - 0 units of item 3: \\(0 \\times 2 = 0\\)\n     - 2 units of item 4: \\(2 \u00d7 30 = 60\\)\n     - 5 units of item 5: \\(5 \u00d7 84 = 420\\)\n     - Total retained value: \\(376 + 208 + 0 + 60 + 420 = 1064\\)\n\nMy proposed offer does not reach my outside option of 1201, but giving away fewer units of my lower-valued items still doesn't help me reach the needed value without significant cuts to gain future concessions from Player 2. Hence, maximizing on acceptance is more crucial knowing further rounds will discount these more without alteration in units. Any reduction in provided value or changes otherwise fails efficiency.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n   Since I know ending with an exchange offering 1064 while seeking to retain or walk away from further future discounted offers would get me below efficient opted amount on any adjustment or deviation, as acceptances outweigh current multiples:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 5, 0, 0]} \n\nThis structuring opts maximal efficiency to maintain units other's negotiation refinement round permits given initial ranged constraint (\"value assurance\" rule for upfront or retained rounds).",

Since I can get at most 1709 by claiming everything, I have only \u201csurplus\u201d 1709 \u2013 1681 = 28 value above my reservation.\n\n5. If I try to \u201cbuy\u201d Player 1\u2019s agreement by offering them any non\u2010zero bundle, even the lowest\u2013value item to me is item 4 at 39 points per unit. Any concession of a whole unit (the minimal indivisible quantity) would lower my own payoff to at most 1709 \u2013 39 = 1670, which is below my reservation of 1681. (Other items have even higher per\u2013unit value for me.) \n\n6. Thus the only counteroffer that \u201cprotects\u201d me so that I get at least 1681 is to claim everything for myself (getting the full 1709). In a counteroffer I do this by offering Player 1 zero units of every item. (I note that although offering Player 1 nothing risks that they won\u2019t accept if their reservation is positive, any offer that gives Player 1 something forces me to give up too much and drop below my reservation. So given my numbers I must insist on keeping all items.) \n\nTherefore, in round 1 my only rational counteroffer is to propose to keep the entire bundle \u2013 that is, to offer Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\nMy action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}",

                    "prompt": "\n    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\n    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\n    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\n    There are 4 units of item 1, 7 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\n    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\n    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 101.\n    Your private values are 94 for item 1, 52 for item 2, 2 for item 3, 30 for item 4, 84 for item 5.\n    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to your total value of all items, which is 1230. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 1201. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1201. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 786 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 7, 5, 1, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    94 x 4 + 52 x 7 + 2 x 5 + 30 x 1 + 84 x 5\n    which is 1200 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1201. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 3, 5, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "My thinking is as follows. In Player\u202f1\u2019s opening offer you (Player\u202f2) would receive [0,0,0,0,2] (so 2 units of item\u202f5) and Player\u202f1 would get the \u201crest\u201d \u2013 namely all of item\u202f2 (5 units), item\u202f3 (3 units), item\u202f4 (1 unit) and the remaining 5 of item\u202f5 (because total item\u202f5 is 7). With my own private values I get:\n\u2003\u2022 item\u202f2: 44 per unit,\n\u2003\u2022 item\u202f3: 94,\n\u2003\u2022 item\u202f4: 64,\n\u2003\u2022 item\u202f5: 15.\nThat offer gives me a total value of 2\u00b715 = 30, which is much lower than my outside option of 105.\n\nIdeally I want to \u201csteer\u201d the allocation so that I end up with more of the items I value highly (especially item\u202f3 \u2013 my highest\u2010valued at 94 per unit \u2013 and item\u202f4 at 64) but \u2013 to get Player\u202f1 to consider accepting my counteroffer \u2013 I must give him at least as \u201cmuch\u201d in terms of total items as his current allocation. (Player\u202f1\u2019s offer gives him 14 total units [5 of item\u202f2, 3 of item\u202f3, 1 of item\u202f4, 5 of item\u202f5].) I might try to \u201cconvert\u201d some of his items\u2014taking 2 from item\u202f3 (which is extra attractive for me) while compensating by giving him additional units of item\u202f5 (which is relatively low for me). \n\nOne natural idea is to \u201cremove\u201d 2 units of item\u202f3 from Player\u202f1\u2019s bundle and give them to me, while \u201cadding\u201d those 2 units to his item\u202f5 share so that his total count remains at 14. In numbers that means:\n\u2003\u2022 For item\u202f3: total is 3; if I take 2 then Player\u202f1 gets 1.\n\u2003\u2022 For item\u202f5: originally Player\u202f1 got 5; if I add 2 then he gets all 7.\nThe other items remain unchanged (item\u202f2: 5 to him; item\u202f4: 1 to him). Under this counteroffer Player\u202f1\u2019s allocation becomes [0,5,1,1,7] (a total of 5+1+1+7 = 14 units) and I receive the remaining items, namely [0,0,2,0,0]. My own value then is 2\u00b794 = 188, well above my outside offer. (Of course Player\u202f1\u2019s true private values are unknown; his bundle still has 14 items \u2013 just with less of item\u202f3 and more of item\u202f5 \u2013 so if his private value for item\u202f3 is high he might have preferred his original allocation. However, given uncertainty and the cost of delay, this is a reasonable counteroffer to try to improve my share while not reducing the \u201csize\u201d of his lot.)\n\nThus, in Round\u202f1 I choose to make the following counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0,5,1,1,7]}",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

Therefore, securing a favorable negotiation early can be beneficial to maintain value.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\nSince there is no current offer on the table, I will need to consider initial counteroffers:\n\n1. **My Counteroffer Evaluation:**\n   - I must propose a distribution where the value to me is greater than my outside offer of 143.\n\n   Let's consider the following possible division:\n   - Keep for myself: [2, 0, 1, 2, 2]\n   - Offer to Player 2: [2, 0, 2, 3, 1]\n\n2. **Calculate My Total Value from This Offer:**\n   - Value from Item 1: 2 units \u00d7 73 = 146\n   - Value from Item 2: 0 units \u00d7 25 = 0\n   - Value from Item 3: 1 unit \u00d7 18 = 18\n   - Value from Item 4: 2 units \u00d7 13 = 26\n   - Value from Item 5: 2 units \u00d7 31 = 62\n   - Total Value = 146 + 0 + 18 + 26 + 62 = 252\n   \nThis proposed division ensures my value from keeping items is 252, which is considerably greater than my outside offer value of 143.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nGiven this analysis, a counteroffer that yields 252 in value is significantly better than my outside alternative of 143.

The current offer gives me:\n\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 2 units\u2003(2\u00d77 = 14)\n\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 0 units\u2003(0)\n\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 2 units\u2003(2\u00d766 = 132)\n\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 3 units\u2003(3\u00d798 = 294)\n\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 1 unit\u2003(1\u00d7100 = 100)\n\u2003Total value = 14 + 132 + 294 + 100 = 540.\nSince this negotiation is in round 1 (gamma^(0)=1), my value would be 540 if I accepted.\n\n2. However, my private outside option is worth 820. That is, if I \u201cWALK away\u201d I get 820 for sure. So 540 is much lower than my fallback.\n\n3. I might consider counteroffering. In crafting a counteroffer I would like to secure at least 820 in my own payout. My overall \u201cpie\u201d (the total value I get if I collected every item) is 1016. Thus, to guarantee myself at least 820 I must leave Player 1 with items valued by me of no more than 1016 \u2212 820 = 196.\n\n4. Yet, note that my unit\u2010values vary significantly across items. In particular, I value items 4 and 5 highly (98 and 100 per unit) while I value item 1 very little (7 per unit). And while Player 1\u2019s private values are unknown, his drawn values come uniformly from 1 to 101 so the \u201ctypical\u201d unit value is around 51. Consequently, transferring items I value very little (such as item 1) is relatively \u201ccheap\u201d from my perspective while being \u201cprofitable\u201d for him.\n\n5. In the current offer Player 1 ends up with 4 \u2212 2 = 2 units of item 1 plus the remainders of the others. His bundle (from my perspective) is:\n\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 2 units\n\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 1 unit (since total 3 minus 2 given to me)\n\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 2 units (5 \u2212 3)\n\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 2 units (3 \u2212 1)\nIf we computed an \u201cexpected\u201d value for him using a rough average (about 51 per unit), his total \u201cvalue\u201d would be roughly 2\u00d751 + 1\u00d751 + 2\u00d751 + 2\u00d751 = 357. (This is only a rough estimate; he knows his own numbers.) Thus his current offer yields him around 357 (expected) from the items.\n\n6. For my own counteroffer to be acceptable (i.e. to induce Player 1 to eventually agree) I would need to offer him at least what he expects from his alternative. But if I grant him additional (more attractive) items \u2013 for example, by shifting more of the \u201clow\u2010value for me\u201d item 1 \u2013 I lose little (only 7 per unit from my scale) but I already can give him at most a total of 4 units of item 1 (worth \u22484\u00d751 = 204 in his eyes). Even if I hand over all item 1 to him, to secure my own value \u2265820 I must take nearly all of the high\u2011value items (items 3, 4, 5) for myself. Working through the math shows that any division in which I secure at least 820 in my own value leaves Player 1 with less than 310 or so in expected value \u2013 well below what his current offer would yield him.\n\n7. Therefore, any counteroffer that would give me at least 820 is likely too \u201cstingy\u201d for Player 1 relative to his outside option. (And waiting another round would also discount the final values slightly.) Since accepting the current offer gives me only 540 \u2013 far below my fallback \u2013 and any counteroffer that would let me get 820 would probably be rejected by Player 1, my best alternative is to WALK away.\n\nThus, my best action in round 1 is to WALK away and guarantee my outside offer of 820 rather than risk a deal that gives me only 540 (or even a counteroffer that Player 1 would reject).\n\nTherefore, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 4, 3, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    91 x 2 + 70 x 0 + 13 x 4 + 62 x 3 + 21 x 3\n    which is 483 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 485. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 4, 3, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    91 x 2 + 70 x 0 + 13 x 4 + 62 x 3 + 21 x 3\n    which is 483 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 485. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

In round 1, the discount does not affect the calculation.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer:** There is no current offer to consider.\n- **Create a Counteroffer:**\n  - I want to ensure my offer gives me a value greater than my outside offer (595).\n  - Let's calculate the value of keeping a certain configuration of items initially. I will tweak it until I'm comfortable that it's above 595 and not disadvantageous.\n\n**Example Calculation of Keeping More Valuable Items:**\n\nIf I keep:\n- 2 units of Item 4 (high value at 87) and all of Item 3 (high value at 57):\n\nThen offer the rest:\n- Item 1: 4 units (offer all)\n- Item 2: 3 units (offer all)\n- Item 3: 0 units (keep all)\n- Item 4: 7 units (out of 9)\n- Item 5: 3 units (offer all)\n\nMy value calculation:\n- Item 1: \\(0 \\times 24 = 0\\)\n- Item 2: \\(0 \\times 5 = 0\\)\n- Item 3: \\(4 \\times 57 = 228\\)\n- Item 4: \\(2 \\times 87 = 174\\)\n- Item 5: \\(0 \\times 22 = 0\\)\n\nTotal value = 228 + 174 = 402\n\nThis total value is below my outside offer of 595.

                    "response": "I'll explain my reasoning briefly.\n\nStep 1. I computed the value of the current offer. It would give me\n\u2003\u2022 4 units of item1: 4\u00d792 = 368\n\u2003\u2022 3 units of item2: 3\u00d78 = 24\n\u2003\u2022 0 units of item3: 0\u00d72 = 0\n\u2003\u2022 4 units of item4: 4\u00d711 = 44\n\u2003\u2022 2 units of item5: 2\u00d784 = 168\nfor a total of 368+24+44+168 = 604. In round 1 this isn\u2019t discounted (\u03b3^(0)=1).\n\nStep 2. However, my outside offer is 729. So accepting an offer worth 604 would leave me worse off than simply walking away. Thus I must counter.\n\nStep 3. In a full-allocation I\u2019d get everything and have value 751. I must get at least 729\u2014that is, I cannot \u201close\u201d more than 751\u2013729 = 22 points (in my own valuation) compared to receiving everything.\n\nStep 4. Since I prefer to concede my \u201clow\u2010value\u201d items (from my perspective) in exchange for giving Player\u202f1 an incentive to settle, I looked at my item values. Items 3 and 2 are relatively \u201ccheap\u201d for me (2 per unit and 8 per unit respectively) yet likely more valuable for the other side (their values are drawn uniformly on [1,101]). To meet exactly a concession of 22:\n\u2003\u2013 If I concede 3 units of item3, I lose 3\u00d72 = 6.\n\u2003\u2013 If I concede 2 units of item2, I lose 2\u00d78 = 16.\nThe total concession is 6+16 = 22, so my kept value becomes 751\u201322 = 729, exactly matching my outside offer.\n\nStep 5. Under this counteroffer I would receive:\n\u2003\u2022 All 4 of item1,\n\u2003\u2022 1 (out of 3) units of item2 (since I give 2 units),\n\u2003\u2022 1 (out of 4) unit of item3 (giving away 3),\n\u2003\u2022 All 9 units of item4,\n\u2003\u2022 All 3 units of item5.\nThat gives me a total value of 4\u00d792 + 1\u00d78 + 1\u00d72 + 9\u00d711 + 3\u00d784 = 368 + 8 + 2 + 99 + 252 = 729.\nI then offer Player\u202f1 exactly the concession: [item1: 0, item2: 2, item3: 3, item4: 0, item5: 0].\n\nThis counteroffer guarantees me my outside option value and gives Player\u202f1 some of the items (mostly those I value little) that might be more attractive to them.\n\nTherefore, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 3, 0, 0]}",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 1, 6, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    24 x 0 + 5 x 3 + 57 x 1 + 87 x 6 + 22 x 0\n    which is 594 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 595. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [4, 3, 0, 4, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 2, 3, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 3, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 227. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 648 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 1, 0, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    14 x 0 + 86 x 1 + 98 x 1 + 11 x 0 + 7 x 6\n    which is 226 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 227. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To decide on my action, let's walk through the analysis step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n1. **Outside Offer Value:**\n   - My outside offer is 227.\n\n2. **Values of the Items Involved (my values per unit):**\n   - Item 1: 14\n   - Item 2: 86\n   - Item 3: 98\n   - Item 4: 11\n   - Item 5: 7\n\n3. **Total Pool of Items:**\n   - Item 1: 6 units\n   - Item 2: 2 units\n   - Item 3: 3 units\n   - Item 4: 3 units\n   - Item 5: 7 units\n\n4. **Discount Factor:**\n   - The discount factor gamma is 0.98. Since it's the first round, the effect of the discount is currently not applied (as it affects values for rounds beyond the first).\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **No Current Offer:** There is no offer on the table from Player 2 yet.\n\n- **Potential Initial Offer for Player 2:**\n\n  Let's break down some potential offers and their values to me:\n\n  1. **Offer: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]** (giving one of each to Player 2)\n     - Items I keep: [5, 1, 2, 2, 6]\n     - My Value = (5 \u00d7 14) + (1 \u00d7 86) + (2 \u00d7 98) + (2 \u00d7 11) + (6 \u00d7 7)\n     - My Value = 70 + 86 + 196 + 22 + 42 = 416\n\n  2. **Offer: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]** (keeping all items)\n     - Items I keep: [6, 2, 3, 3, 7]\n     - My Value = (6 \u00d7 14) + (2 \u00d7 86) + (3 \u00d7 98) + (3 \u00d7 11) + (7 \u00d7 7)\n     - My Value = 84 + 172 + 294 + 33 + 49 = 632\n\n  3. **Offer: [2, 1, 1, 1, 2]**\n     - Items I keep: [4, 1, 2, 2, 5]\n     - My Value = (4 \u00d7 14) + (1 \u00d7 86) + (2 \u00d7 98) + (2 \u00d7 11) + (5 \u00d7 7)\n     - My Value = 56 + 86 + 196 + 22 + 35 = 395\n\n  4. **Offer: [3, 1, 1, 1, 3]**\n     - Items I keep: [3, 1, 2, 2, 4]\n     - My Value = (3 \u00d7 14) + (1 \u00d7 86) + (2 \u00d7 98) + (2 \u00d7 11) + (4 \u00d7 7)\n     - My Value = 42 + 86 + 196 + 22 + 28 = 374\n\nThese potential offers are examples showing how to balance between maximizing my value and still potentially enticing Player 2.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\n- **Considerations:**\n  - I cannot offer more to Player 2 than the value of my outside offer (Mistake 2).\n  - I aim to make an offer that ensures my total value is at least equal to my outside offer of 227.\n\nFrom the example calculations, an offer like [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] ensures a high total value for me (416), much better than my outside. However, even an offer like [3, 1, 1, 1, 3] gives a total value of 374, which is still higher than my fallback.\n\n- **Proposed Offer:**\n  Given these calculations, it's reasonable to try offering something like [3, 1, 1, 1, 3] as an initial proposal to Player 2, aiming above my outside value.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 1, 1, 1, 3]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 3, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    95 x 0 + 95 x 0 + 24 x 0 + 36 x 3 + 86 x 1\n    which is 194 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 201. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To determine the initial offer, let's walk through the step-by-step analysis as guided by the question:\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 201.\n   - My valuation for items is as follows:\n     - Item 1: 95\n     - Item 2: 95\n     - Item 3: 24\n     - Item 4: 36\n     - Item 5: 86\n   - The total pool of items is: \n     - 1 unit of Item 1\n     - 3 units of Item 2\n     - 1 unit of Item 3\n     - 8 units of Item 4\n     - 1 unit of Item 5\n   - The discount factor gamma affects the value of future rounds. However, since we are at round 1, the timing discount is not applied yet (i.e., gamma^(r-1) = 1).\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Since this is the first round, there is no current offer from Player 2.\n   - I need to make an initial offer. Let's calculate potential values I could achieve by keeping a certain division of items.\n   - My goal is to ensure any offer I make has a personal value higher than 201. I want to maximize my value while also leaving enough for Player 2 so they consider accepting.\n\nLet's propose an initial offer where I keep some items and give away others in a way that maximizes my value while ensuring it's better than my outside offer:\n\n- I will try to structure the initial offer as follows:\n  - Keep all of Item 1 and Item 5 since they have the highest value to me.\n  - Maybe I can afford to give away most of Item 4 as it has lower value to me.\n\nCalculate the example allocation:\n1. Item 1: I keep 1; give 0\n2. Item 2: I keep 1; give 2\n3. Item 3: I keep 1; give 0\n4. Item 4: I keep 3; give 5\n5. Item 5: I keep 1; give 0\n\nMy value:\n- 1 unit of Item 1: 1 x 95 = 95\n- 1 units of Item 2: 1 x 95 = 95\n- 1 unit of Item 3: 1 x 24 = 24\n- 3 units of Item 4: 3 x 36 = 108\n- 1 unit of Item 5: 1 x 86 = 86\n\nTotal value = 95 + 95 + 24 + 108 + 86 = 408\n\nThis value of 408 is greater than my outside offer value of 201. Therefore, the offer is valid and caters to maximizing my value. \n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n\nMy calculated total value of my proposed offer is higher than my outside offer, making it a reasonable strategy. Therefore, I will go ahead and propose the offer. \n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 0, 5, 0]}",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 3, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    95 x 0 + 95 x 0 + 24 x 0 + 36 x 3 + 86 x 1\n    which is 194 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 201. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 0, 5, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 3, 0, 8, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 3, 0, 8, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "I'm going to explain my reasoning before stating my action.\n\nMy own private values are very uneven across the items. In particular I value item\u202f1 at 68, item\u202f3 at 35, and item\u202f5 at 11\u2014substantially more than item\u202f2 (7 per unit) or item\u202f4 (3 per unit). (Recall the totals are: [1,3,1,8,1].) In earlier rounds I already \u201ctried\u201d an offer where I would have kept items 1, 3, and 5 (thereby getting 68+35+11 = 114 in undiscounted value) and conceded the lower\u2013value items (items 2 and 4) to Player\u202f1. That counteroffer would have given me a much higher payoff than the very poor current offer [0,1,0,1,0] which gives me only 7+3 = 10 (or 9.8 once discounted by \u03b3 = 0.98 in round\u202f2).\n\nHowever, I must also worry about Player\u202f1\u2019s incentives. In the current round Player\u202f1\u2019s offer of [0,1,0,1,0] would leave them with the complement allocation [1,2,1,7,1]\u2014a bundle that (with their private values, which are drawn uniformly between 1 and 101) on average is very attractive. If I propose a split that is \u201ctoo extreme\u201d (i.e. if I try to keep every high\u2013value item for myself) they will compare it with what they\u2019d get if negotiations continue. In a \u201cfair\u201d (or Nash\u2013bargaining) type division one might expect that the surplus over the disagreement (outside) points is split roughly equally. In this problem my outside offer is 46 (although discounted in round\u202f2 it\u2019s roughly 46\u00d70.98 \u2248 45.1) while for Player\u202f1 the fallback is unknown but the fact that they just proposed [0,1,0,1,0] suggests they are satisfied with keeping almost the entire bundle (in fact, [1,2,1,7,1]). \n\nSince I want to get a deal that is much better than walking away (my outside is 46), I must \u201cbuy\u201d Player\u202f1\u2019s acceptance by ensuring that, after the split, they get at least as much as (or marginally more than) what they\u2019d expect from continuing the negotiation. In my ideal outcome I\u2019d like to grab the high\u2013value items (items 1 and 3) while conceding all the low\u2013value items (items 2 and 4) and perhaps also item 5 if needed to \u201csweeten\u201d the deal. Without knowing Player\u202f1\u2019s exact preferences it is difficult to set the perfect numbers; however, comparing my current offer they already lost a couple of high\u2013value items relative to a \u201ccomplete\u201d split (their fallback bundle is [1,2,1,7,1]). \n\nA natural candidate that \u201cswaps\u201d one high\u2013value for a low\u2013value fair share is to offer Player\u202f1 the following:\n\u2003\u2022 Let them have all units of items 2 and 4 (i.e. 3 and 8, respectively) and also give them item\u202f5 (1 unit). \n\u2003\u2022 That leaves me with items 1 and 3 (1 unit each) which, in my own terms, is 68 + 35 = 103 undiscounted (or about 103\u00d70.98 \u2248 101 if we account for the discount in round\u202f2). \n\nThis counteroffer (which in full \u201coffer\u2010format\u201d is expressed as what I give to Player\u202f1) is [0, 3, 0, 8, 1]. Notice the \u201closs\u201d for Player\u202f1 relative to their fallback [1, 2, 1, 7, 1] is that I am not giving them items 1 and 3\u2014but by giving them an extra unit in items 2 and 4 (and also item 5 remains allocated to them) my offer is \u201con average\u201d nearly even when you compare average values (since in expectation each item is roughly worth 51 for them). \n\nI acknowledge that if Player\u202f1 happens to have very high private values for items 1 or 3 then comparing:\n\u2003Fallback F = [1, 2, 1, 7, 1] versus My Offer O = [0, 3, 0, 8, 1],\nthe net difference is F \u2013 O = [1, \u20131, 1, \u20131, 0] (in other words, the concession is (a\u2081 + a\u2083) versus the \u201cextra\u201d they get in items 2 and 4, i.e. a\u2082 + a\u2084). On average those differences would tend to cancel; and given that delaying to round 3 further hurts (with an extra discount) Player\u202f1\u2019s payoff, I expect they could well accept my counteroffer.\n\nThus, to avoid risking ending up with my outside option (which is far lower than 101) I decide to make the counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 0, 8, 1]}",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 922. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 922. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 888 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 4, 1, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    17 x 1 + 63 x 1 + 87 x 4 + 38 x 1 + 91 x 5\n    which is 921 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 922. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Since this is round 2, the effective value of any offer is multiplied by gamma, i.e., 0.98.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n- **Current Offer [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]**:\n  - Value to me: 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 87 = 87\n  - Since this is round 2, value becomes 87 \u00d7 0.98 = 85.26\n  - This is much lower than my outside offer of 922.\n\n- **Evaluate Counteroffers**: \n  My goal is to devise a counteroffer that provides me with a total value greater than 922, taking into account the discount factor. \n\n  If I try to keep a higher value configuration, such as:\n  - Keeping 7 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5 (essentially offering: [0, 0, 2, 0, 3]), I achieve the following:\n  - 7 \u00d7 17 + 4 \u00d7 63 + 3 \u00d7 87 + 3 \u00d7 38 + 2 \u00d7 91\n  - = 119 + 252 + 261 + 114 + 182\n  - = 928\n  - After applying the discount factor, the value becomes 928 \u00d7 0.98 \u2248 909.44\n\n  This still does not exceed my outside offer of 922. Further reductions in the values I give away would likely cause the value to me to drop below 922.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\nCurrent offer provides less value than my outside offer, and possible counteroffers in my explored range still fall below 922.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 4, 4, 5, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    50 x 2 + 84 x 4 + 55 x 4 + 15 x 5 + 9 x 1\n    which is 740 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 741. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

The offer \u201con the table\u201d means that Player 1 is offering us a bundle of items: [1, 2, 0, 1, 1]. That gives us:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 1: 1 unit \u00d7 33 = 33\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 2: 2 units \u00d7 56 = 112\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 3: 0 units \u00d7 5 = 0\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 4: 1 unit \u00d7 4 = 4\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 5: 1 unit \u00d7 40 = 40\n\u2003\u2003Total = 33 + 112 + 0 + 4 + 40 = 189.\nBecause we also have an outside option of 385 (which would be realized immediately with no discount) accepting 189 is far worse than walking away.\n\n2. In a counteroffer we get to propose a split \u2013 our offer is expressed as the numbers given to Player 1. Then our own allocation is the remaining items. (For example, if we offer Player 1 [a, b, c, d, e], then we would end up with [5\u2013a, 5\u2013b, 4\u2013c, 6\u2013d, 2\u2013e].)\n\u2003\u2003We need our eventual deal\u2019s (discounted) value to be at least greater than our outside option (385) while giving Player 1 \u201cjust enough\u201d so that he would be willing to accept immediately rather than waiting or using his own outside offer.\n\u2003\u2003We have 569 total \u201cvalue\u201d (if we got all items) so we have negotiation room. To get above 385 our package should be a \u201cbig share\u201d of the high\u2010value items:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Our high\u2010value items are item 1 (33 per unit), item 2 (56 per unit) and item 5 (40 per unit).\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Our \u201ccheaper\u201d items are item 3 (5 per unit) and item 4 (4 per unit).\nIt is natural to try to \u201cpay\u201d Player 1 with the lower\u2010value items while keeping most of the high\u2010value ones.\n\n3. An \u201cextreme\u201d division that gives us nearly everything would be to let Player 1 have all of items 3 and 4. In that case:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Player 1 would get: item 3: 4; item 4: 6.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Our share would be: item 1: 5; item 2: 5; item 5: 2 \u2013 with a total value = 5\u00d733 + 5\u00d756 + 2\u00d740 = 165 + 280 + 80 = 525.\nAlthough 525 is well above our outside option, such an offer might not be acceptable to Player 1 because his \u201creservation\u201d (his own outside offer) might be somewhat high. We know that Player 1 already offered an offer in round 1 (by offering us a bundle [1,2,0,1,1] which implies he would get the remainder [4,3,4,5,1]) and\u2014assuming his private unit values average around the mid\u2010range (given the uniform 1\u2013101 draw)\u2014that bundle likely gives him a fairly attractive value.\n\n4. To tip the balance in his favor while still moving many high\u2010value items (for us) into our pile, we can \u201cgive him\u201d a minimal but \u201cjust acceptable\u201d extra piece relative to his previous position. In our counteroffer we decide to:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Let Player 1 get most of the low\u2010value items (all 4 of item 3 and all 6 of item 4).\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Give him a tiny \u201cconcession\u201d from one high\u2010value category so that his bundle is not much worse than in his earlier offer. For instance, we can offer him 1 unit of item 1 (even though item 1, at 33 per unit for us, is less preferred for him on our side) and also 1 unit of item 5.\nWith that, our offer to Player 1 becomes: \n\u2003\u2003item 1: 1, item 2: 0, item 3: 4, item 4: 6, item 5: 1.\nThen our own allocation (the complement) is:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 1: 5 \u2013 1 = 4,\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 2: 5 \u2013 0 = 5,\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 3: 4 \u2013 4 = 0,\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 4: 6 \u2013 6 = 0,\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 5: 2 \u2013 1 = 1.\nOur total value becomes:\n\u2003\u20034\u00d733 + 5\u00d756 + 0\u00d75 + 0\u00d74 + 1\u00d740 = 132 + 280 + 0 + 0 + 40 = 452,\nwhich comfortably beats our outside option of 385, even after ensuring minimal extra utility to Player 1.\n\n5. Although we cannot know Player 1\u2019s exact numbers, by \u201cpaying\u201d him with the lower\u2010value items (items 3 and 4) and a slight additional concession in one high\u2010value category (item 5 or item 1), we lean on the idea that he should compare this immediate (undiscounted) offer favorably to his outside option as well as the likelihood of delay discounting in later rounds.\n\nThus, our counteroffer is to offer Player 1 the bundle [1, 0, 4, 6, 1] (meaning these many units of items 1\u20135 to him), leaving us with [4, 5, 0, 0, 1]. \n\nOur final action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 4, 6, 1]}",

In round 2, if we reach an agreement, the value will be reduced by gamma^(2-1) = 0.98.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer on the table, where I receive [1, 0, 4, 6, 1]:\n     - Value to me:\n       - Item 1: 1 \u00d7 50 = 50\n       - Item 2: 0 \u00d7 84 = 0\n       - Item 3: 4 \u00d7 55 = 220\n       - Item 4: 6 \u00d7 15 = 90\n       - Item 5: 1 \u00d7 9 = 9\n     - Total value = 50 + 0 + 220 + 90 + 9 = 369\n     - Adjusted for the discount factor: 369 \u00d7 0.98 = 361.62\n   - Comparing to my outside offer value of 741, the current offer (value 361.62) is less favorable.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - The current offer's present value (361.62) is much lower than my outside offer value (741).\n   - It's not in my interest to accept the current offer.\n   - Walking away gives me 741, which is significantly better than the current offer.\n   - I need to consider proposing a counteroffer that ensures my value is higher than 741 after accounting for the discount factor.\n\nLet's calculate a potential counteroffer. If I were to keep [4, 5, 0, 0, 1] items (meaning I offer [1, 0, 4, 6, 1] to Player 2 and take the remaining), my value would be:\n\n- Items to keep: [4, 5, 0, 0, 1]\n  - Item 1: 4 \u00d7 50 = 200\n  - Item 2: 5 \u00d7 84 = 420\n  - Item 3: 0 \u00d7 55 = 0\n  - Item 4: 0 \u00d7 15 = 0\n  - Item 5: 1 \u00d7 9 = 9\n- Total value = 200 + 420 + 0 + 0 + 9 = 629\n- Adjusted for the discount factor: 629 \u00d7 0.98 = 616.42\n\nEven with this counteroffer, the value (616.42) is still less than my outside offer (741). I should find a counteroffer that exceeds it after discount factor adjustment.\n\nConsidering all factors, I will choose to walk away:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 751. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 751. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 813 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 3, 2, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    4 x 0 + 86 x 1 + 30 x 3 + 83 x 2 + 68 x 6\n    which is 750 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 751. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To make an informed decision, let's analyze the current situation step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Situation\n- **My Outside Offer Value**: 751\n- **Values of Items (per unit)**:\n  - Item 1: 4\n  - Item 2: 86\n  - Item 3: 30\n  - Item 4: 83\n  - Item 5: 68\n- **Total Pool of Items**: \n  - 4 units of item 1\n  - 7 units of item 2\n  - 5 units of item 3\n  - 3 units of item 4\n  - 7 units of item 5\n\n- **Discount Factor**: It is currently round 1, so the discount factor doesn't affect this round's offer. Offers in later rounds will need to be evaluated with the discount factor applied.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\nSince there is no offer from Player 2 yet, I need to create an initial offer that maximizes my value, ensuring it is better than my outside offer of 751.\n\n- I want to propose an offer where my total value is at least 751 to make it worthwhile compared to my guaranteed outside option. Here\u2019s a potential initial offer:\n\n#### Keep more valuable items:\n1. Prioritize keeping units of items with higher personal value.\n2. Offer a reasonable yet strategic division that maximizes my remaining value.\n\n#### Calculation of Value:\nAssuming I keep a higher proportion of higher-value items (Item 2 and Item 4) and minimize what is given of less valuable items, an offer might look like:\n\n- You keep: \n  - 0 units of item 1\n  - 5 units of item 2\n  - 2 units of item 3\n  - 2 units of item 4\n  - 2 units of item 5\n\n- Offer to give:\n  - 4 units of item 1 (all)\n  - 2 units of item 2\n  - 3 units of item 3\n  - 1 unit of item 4\n  - 5 units of item 5\n\n#### Calculate the Value of Keeping:\n- Values of kept items:\n  - 0 units of item 1 = 0 x 4 = 0\n  - 5 units of item 2 = 5 x 86 = 430\n  - 2 units of item 3 = 2 x 30 = 60\n  - 2 units of item 4 = 2 x 83 = 166\n  - 2 units of item 5 = 2 x 68 = 136\n- Total Value = 0 + 430 + 60 + 166 + 136 = 792\n\n### Conclusion\nThis offer gives me a total value of 792, which is above my outside offer of 751. Therefore, I avoid making a mistake of offering less than my outside offer (Mistake 2).\n\nGiven this analysis, I\u2019ll propose a counteroffer that ensures my value is maximized while being above my outside offer.\n\n### Action\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 2, 3, 1, 5]}",

As Player 2 I can counteroffer. In a counteroffer I choose the division by \u201coffering\u201d some of the available units to Player 1 \u2013 then I keep the remainder. My objective is to secure at least as much as my disagreement payoff (or a little more) while leaving the counteroffer attractive enough that Player 1 might agree. (Both outcomes would be multiplied by gamma^(r\u20131)=1 in round 1.)\n\n4. I need a deal that gives me at least 1321 in my own value. If I got everything I\u2019d have 1755, so I may \u201cconcede\u201d items to Player 1 with a total \u201ccost\u201d (in my valuation) of no more than 1755\u20131321 = 434.

Note that while the current offer (where Player 1\u2019s \u201cproposal\u201d would leave them with the remainder) would give them an allocation (by my count) of [0,5,2,2,2] with a total (my\u2010valued) \u201cworth\u201d of roughly 854, my counteroffer gives Player 1 the following division:\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 4, Item 2: 3, Item 3: 0, Item 4: 3, Item 5: 0\u2003\u2003(sum = 4+3+0+3+0 = 10 units)\n\u2003\u2003I cannot know their true values but\u2013given that both sides have private valuations drawn uniformly\u2013this counteroffer is an attempt to get a better outcome for me (I\u2019d secure 1343 vs. 1321 if no deal) while still \u201cbuying\u201d Player 1\u2019s willingness to accept. (If they believe a future round might reduce the total \u201cpie\u201d further via discounting, then this division might be acceptable.)\n\n7. Since the current offer is clearly worse for me than my outside option, I should not ACCEPT. Also, I want to try to \u201cnegotiate\u201d further rather than immediately WALK away.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 751. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 813 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 3, 2, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    4 x 0 + 86 x 1 + 30 x 3 + 83 x 2 + 68 x 6\n    which is 750 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 751. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [4, 2, 3, 1, 5]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [4, 3, 0, 3, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [4, 3, 0, 3, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

This factor will slightly decrease my potential reward in round 3 or if an agreement is accepted in this round.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer Value (if I accept)**:\n  - 4 units of item 1 = \\(4 \\times 4 = 16\\)\n  - 3 units of item 2 = \\(3 \\times 86 = 258\\)\n  - 0 units of item 3 = \\(0 \\times 30 = 0\\)\n  - 3 units of item 4 = \\(3 \\times 83 = 249\\)\n  - 0 units of item 5 = \\(0 \\times 68 = 0\\)\n  - Total value = 523\n\n- **Compare with Outside Offer**: The value of the current offer to me (523) is less than my outside offer (751), so, accepting this offer would be a mistake as indicated in Mistake 4.\n\n- **Evaluate Potential Counteroffers**: Let's find a division that gives me a value over my outside offer. \n\n  - As a trial, consider keeping [3, 4, 5, 0, 6] (which means offering [1, 3, 0, 3, 1]).\n    - 3 units of item 1 = \\(3 \\times 4 = 12\\)\n    - 4 units of item 2 = \\(4 \\times 86 = 344\\)\n    - 5 units of item 3 = \\(5 \\times 30 = 150\\)\n    - 0 units of item 4 = \\(0 \\times 83 = 0\\)\n    - 6 units of item 5 = \\(6 \\times 68 = 408\\)\n    - Total Value = 914\n\n  This offer gives me a combined value of 914, which is higher than my outside offer of 751, adjusted by the discount factor: \\(914 \\times 0.98 = 895.72\\).\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\n- **Accept the Current Offer?** No, because its value (523) is less than my outside offer.\n\n- **Walk Away?** Not yet, as there is potential to make a more favorable counteroffer that clearly beats the outside offer value.\n\n- **Propose a Counteroffer?** Yes, I will propose the counteroffer where I keep [3, 4, 5, 0, 6] and offer [1, 3, 0, 3, 1] to Player 2.\n\nThus, based on my analysis:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 3, 0, 3, 1]}\n```",

                    "response": "I'll explain my reasoning briefly. My reservation (outside\u2010offer) is 1321, so any agreement in round\u20052 must yield me a \u201craw\u201d (undiscounted) value of at least about 1321/0.98 \u2248 1347. (Recall the deal\u2019s eventual payoff is discounted by 0.98 when reached in round\u20052.) In other words, if I settle I must \u201cwin\u201d at least roughly 1347 in terms of my own items\u2019 values in order to beat my fallback.\n\nMy own values per unit are: item\u20051: 4, item\u20052: 84, item\u20053: 88, item\u20054: 48, item\u20055: 81, so the full \u201cbundle\u201d is worth 1755 to me. (That is why I must secure at least 1347 value for myself.) In any division I propose the items I \u201cgive\u201d to Player\u20051 can be thought of as \u201cconcessions\u201d costing me 4\u00b7(n\u2081) + 84\u00b7(n\u2082) + 88\u00b7(n\u2083) + 48\u00b7(n\u2084) + 81\u00b7(n\u2085). To ensure my own share is at least 1347, I must have: \n\n\u2003\u20031755 \u2212 [4\u00b7(n\u2081) + 84\u00b7(n\u2082) + 88\u00b7(n\u2083) + 48\u00b7(n\u2084) + 81\u00b7(n\u2085)] \u2265 1347  \n\u2003\u2003\u27f9 4\u00b7(n\u2081) + 84\u00b7(n\u2082) + 88\u00b7(n\u2083) + 48\u00b7(n\u2084) + 81\u00b7(n\u2085) \u2264 408.\n\nI also want to \u201csell\u201d Player\u20051 on my counteroffer rather than let negotiations break down (or simply accept an offer that nets me only about 471 discounted, which is far less than 1321). Although Player\u20051\u2019s private values are unknown, notice that in round\u20052 he offered an allocation giving me [1,3,0,3,1] (so he would keep the remainder, namely [3,4,5,0,6]). That shows he has an appetite for bigger quantities of items\u2014especially in the parts where I lose little value by conceding. Since I lose very little when I \u201cgive\u201d item\u20051 (only 4 per unit) and moderately when I give item\u20054 (48 per unit), I can afford to concede those fully. Then, using my \u201cbudget\u201d of 408 total concession\u2010points, I can add a modest number of units of item\u20055 (which cost me 81 per unit) because that is the cheapest among the higher\u2013value items from my perspective (items\u20052 and 3 cost 84 and 88 per unit respectively).\n\nOne attractive plan is to give Player\u20051 all 4 units of item\u20051 (costing me 4\u00d74 = 16), all 3 units of item\u20054 (3\u00d748 = 144) and 3 units of item\u20055 (3\u00d781 = 243). The total \u201cconcession cost\u201d is 16 + 144 + 243 = 403 \u2264 408. (I could hardly spare any cost to even add any concession from items\u20052 or 3 while keeping my own raw value high.) My retained bundle then becomes the remainder:\n\u2003\u2003Item\u20051: 4\u20134 = 0  \n\u2003\u2003Item\u20052: 7\u20130 = 7  \n\u2003\u2003Item\u20053: 5\u20130 = 5  \n\u2003\u2003Item\u20054: 3\u20133 = 0  \n\u2003\u2003Item\u20055: 7\u20133 = 4\n\nThat gives me a raw value of 0\u00b74 + 7\u00b784 + 5\u00b788 + 0\u00b748 + 4\u00b781 = 588 + 440 + 324 = 1352, which when discounted by 0.98 yields about 1325\u2014just slightly above my outside offer. (Thus, if Player\u20051 accepts, I \u201cwin\u201d a tiny bit over what I\u2019d get by walking away.)\n\nMy counteroffer \u201cpackage\u201d to Player\u20051 is then the items I offer him (namely, [4, 0, 0, 3, 3]). This allocation gives him the low\u2013value item 1 (which he might like to get more of in lieu of expensive concessions on items 2 or 3) plus all of item 4 and some of item 5. Although his round\u20052 proposal would have given him larger quantities on items 2, 3 and 5, I must balance his incentives with my own reservation. Given the time discount (and the risk that if we proceed a deal may not be reached at all), this counteroffer\u2014in which I ask Player\u20051 to take [4, 0, 0, 3, 3] so that I keep [0, 7, 5, 0, 4]\u2014is my best attempt to improve on my fallback (1321) while keeping the \u201ccost\u201d to me under 408.\n\nThus, my action is to propose a counteroffer with the allocation to Player\u20051 being [4, 0, 0, 3, 3]. \n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 0, 0, 3, 3]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 864. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 876 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 0, 7, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    82 x 2 + 90 x 0 + 7 x 0 + 90 x 7 + 23 x 3\n    which is 863 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 864. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

As we are in round 2, the current value of an offer needs to be multiplied by gamma^(2-1) = 0.98.\n\n4) **Assessing Current Offer**:\n   - Current offer to me: [2, 0, 1, 4, 2]\n   - Calculating the value if I accept this offer:\n     - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 82 = 164\n     - 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 90 = 0\n     - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 7 = 7\n     - 4 units of item 4 = 4 \u00d7 90 = 360\n     - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 23 = 46\n   - Total value without discount factor: 164 + 0 + 7 + 360 + 46 = 577\n   - Applying the discount factor: 577 \u00d7 0.98 = 565.46\n\n5) **Comparison to Outside Offer**:\n   - The discounted value of the current offer (565.46) is less than my outside offer (864).\n\n6) **Decision-Making**:\n   - The current offer is too low, especially after considering the discount factor.\n   - I need to propose a counteroffer that gives me a total value higher than my outside offer.\n\n7) **Proposing a Counteroffer**:\n   - Objective: Ensure total value of items I keep is greater than 864 before discounting.\n   - A straightforward approach:\n     - Keep a significant portion of high-value items (1 and 4) and some of others.\n\n   Counteroffer:\n   - Offer Player 2: [0, 0, 1, 3, 2]\n   - Items I keep: \n     - Item 1: 5 (5 - 0)\n     - Item 2: 0 (0 - 0)\n     - Item 3: 2 (3 - 1)\n     - Item 4: 4 (7 - 3)\n     - Item 5: 3 (5 - 2)\n   - Values: \n     - 5 * 82 + 0 * 90 + 2 * 7 + 4 * 90 + 3 * 23\n     - = 410 + 0 + 14 + 360 + 69 = 853\n\nEven this offer is below my outside offer value. Adjust to revise and achieve a valid offer that is more than 864 after considering the discount aspect again.\n\nRevised counteroffer needed. Offer Player 2 the least high-value items:\n\n- Correct counteroffer to ensure value above 864 with some buffer against gamma discount.\n  \nFinal counteroffer proposal:\n- Offer Player 2: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2]\n- Value computed:\n  - Items I keep: 5 * 82 + 0 * 90 + 3 * 7 + 5 * 90 + 3 * 23\n  - = 410 + 0 + 21 + 450 + 69 = 950\n  - Effective discounted value (round 2, gamma = 0.98): 950 \u00d7 0.98 = 931\n\nThis is comfortably greater than my outside offer value of 864. \n\nTherefore, I will proceed with this proper counteroffer. \n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 2, 2]}\n```",

Discounted (\u03b3 = 0.98) it is only about 78.4\u2014far below your outside option of 265.\n\u2022 Thus accepting the current offer is unattractive.\n\u2022 In a counteroffer you can \u201cdesign\u201d an allocation of the fixed items (5 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 7 of item 4, 5 of item 5) between you and Player 1.\n\u2022 Your raw total value if you got all items would be 771. To beat 265 in discounted terms (round\u20112 discount, multiply by 0.98) you need to secure a raw value of at least about 265/0.98 \u2248 270.4.\n\u2022 Noting that your highest per\u2011unit values are for item 1 (69) and item 3 (52), a way to \u201cbuy in\u201d extra value is to reserve for yourself most (but not all) of those items.\n\u2022 One safe counteroffer is to propose that you get 2 units of item 1 and all 3 units of item 3. That gives you a raw value of (2\u00d769) + (3\u00d752) = 138 + 156 = 294 (and 294\u00d70.98 \u2248 288, which exceeds your outside offer).\n\u2022 This counteroffer then gives Player 1 the remaining items: from item 1, 3 units (since total 5 \u2013 your 2 = 3), all of item 4 (7 units) and all of item 5 (5 units).

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 0, 7, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    82 x 2 + 90 x 0 + 7 x 0 + 90 x 7 + 23 x 3\n    which is 863 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 864. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

I will initially consider keeping items that give me the highest values.\n2. I must avoid giving an offer that results in a total valued less than my outside offer of 267.\n3. I must make sure my offer doesn\u2019t give away all items or propose an invalid offer.\n\n**Calculations for some example allocations:**\n\n1. **Offer: [0, 1, 1, 0, 1] - Keeping [1, 3, 3, 0, 2]:**\n   - Value = \\( (1 \\times 99) + (3 \\times 98) + (3 \\times 90) + (0 \\times 8) + (2 \\times 49) \\)\n   - Value = \\( 99 + 294 + 270 + 0 + 98 = 761 \\)\n\nThis offer gives me a total value of 761, which is well above my outside offer of 267.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 4, 1, 2, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    23 x 1 + 62 x 4 + 62 x 1 + 17 x 2 + 24 x 0\n    which is 367 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 368. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

For example, giving 1 unit of item\u202f1 (worth 30 to me) would leave me with 923 \u2013 30 = 893, which is safely above my outside offer. (Other simple options exist\u2014for instance, giving the one unit of item\u202f3 would cost me 21 points, leaving me with 902\u2014but I decide that offering 1 unit of item\u202f1 strikes a reasonable balance; even though I \u201close\u201d 30 points in my own valuation, it might be more attractive to Player\u202f1 than an item I value at only 21.)\n\nThus, I propose giving Player\u202f1 one unit of item 1; in other words, I keep the rest. This counteroffer allocates:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Player\u202f1: item1 = 1; item2 = 0; item3 = 0; item4 = 0; item5 = 0\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Me (Player\u202f2): item1 = 6\u20131 = 5; item2 = 5; item3 = 1; item4 = 3; item5 = 3\n\nMy share\u2019s value computes to:\n\u20035\u00d730 + 5\u00d779 + 1\u00d721 + 3\u00d772 + 3\u00d737 = 150 + 395 + 21 + 216 + 111 = 893 \n\u2014which is above my outside offer of 873 and thus acceptable for me. \n\nBased on this reasoning, my action is to make a counteroffer as follows:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]}",
                    "action": "COUNTEROFFER"

                    "prompt": "\n    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\n    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\n    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\n    There are 6 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\n    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\n    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 101.\n    Your private values are 23 for item 1, 62 for item 2, 62 for item 3, 17 for item 4, 24 for item 5.\n    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to your total value of all items, which is 633. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 368. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 368. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 564 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 4, 1, 2, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    23 x 1 + 62 x 4 + 62 x 1 + 17 x 2 + 24 x 0\n    which is 367 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 368. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

It gives me items [0, 1, 0, 1, 0] so I\u2019d receive 1 unit of item\u202f2 (worth 79 to me) and 1 unit of item\u202f4 (worth 72), for a \u201craw\u201d total of 151. Since we\u2019re in round\u202f2 the outcome is discounted by 0.98, yielding about 148 (151\u00d70.98). By comparison, my private outside offer is 873. Even before thinking about counteroffers, 148 is very unattractive relative to 873.\n\nIf I consider making a counteroffer I face a tough squeeze. My total full\u2010pie value\u2014all items\u2014is 923, so to beat my outside option I must obtain a deal that gives me a discounted value of at least 873. In round\u202f2 the discount factor is 0.98, meaning I need to get items worth roughly 873/0.98 \u2248 890 in \u201craw\u201d value. That leaves me only 923 \u2013 890 \u2248 33 points of value that I can \u201cgive up\u201d to Player\u00a01. \n\nI would like to use these \u201ccheap\u201d parts (from my perspective) to buy Player\u00a01\u2019s agreement. My values show that item\u202f3 is among the cheapest for me (21 per unit) while item\u202f1 is 30 per unit. In theory I might try to offer something like \u201cyou get one unit of item\u202f3\u201d (a cost of 21 to me) so that I get all the rest giving me a raw value of 923 \u2013 21 = 902 (902\u00d70.98 \u2248 883, which beats my 873 outside offer). But from Player\u00a01\u2019s view his private values come from Uniform(1,101) so his value for that one unit might be around 51 on average\u2014and his own outside offer might be on the order of roughly half his full\u2011pie value (expected somewhere in the 400\u2013500 range). In other words, if I surrender just one cheap unit to him he\u2019d likely find it far below his reservation, and he\u2019d reject my counteroffer. And if I try to \u201cpay him\u201d more by giving up additional units, I would drop my own allocation so far that my payoff would fall below my outside offer. \n\nIn summary, neither accepting the current offer (148) nor a counteroffer that might be acceptable to Player\u00a01 (which would force me to sacrifice almost all my \u201csurplus,\u201d leaving me near or below 873) is appealing. My best guaranteed outcome is to walk away and take the 873 from my outside option.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",
