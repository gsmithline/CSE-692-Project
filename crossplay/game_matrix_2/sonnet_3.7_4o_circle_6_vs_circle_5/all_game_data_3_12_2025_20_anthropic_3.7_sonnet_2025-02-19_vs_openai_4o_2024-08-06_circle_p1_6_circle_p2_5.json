Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1145. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 852 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [7, 2, 4, 4, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    100 x 7 + 59 x 2 + 53 x 4 + 14 x 4 + 58 x 1\n    which is 1144 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1145. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 728. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 873 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 2, 5, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    35 x 2 + 65 x 2 + 85 x 5 + 56 x 0 + 50 x 2\n    which is 725 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 728. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 5, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 4, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 4, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Let's analyze the current situation step by step:\n\n### 1) Current Situation Analysis:\n\n- **Outside Offer Value:** Your outside offer value is 728.\n  \n- **Values of Items:**\n  - Item 1: 35 per unit\n  - Item 2: 65 per unit\n  - Item 3: 85 per unit\n  - Item 4: 56 per unit\n  - Item 5: 50 per unit\n\n- **Total Pool of Items:** \n  - 3 units of item 1\n  - 4 units of item 2\n  - 5 units of item 3\n  - 0 units of item 4\n  - 3 units of item 5\n\n- **Current Offer:** Player 1 is offering you [1, 1, 4, 0, 0], which means you get:\n  - 1 unit of item 1\n  - 1 unit of item 2\n  - 4 units of item 3\n  - 0 units of item 4\n  - 0 units of item 5\n\n- **Value of Current Offer:** \n  - Item 1: 1 \u00d7 35 = 35\n  - Item 2: 1 \u00d7 65 = 65\n  - Item 3: 4 \u00d7 85 = 340\n  - Item 4: 0 \u00d7 56 = 0\n  - Item 5: 0 \u00d7 50 = 0\n\n  Total value = 35 + 65 + 340 = 440 to you.\n\n- **Discount Factor:** As it is round 2, the negotiations are discounted by gamma^(r-1) = 0.98^(2-1) = 0.98. However, since the current offer value of 440 is already less than your outside offer of 728, further discounting only makes it less appealing.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n\n- **Current Offer:** Accepting this offer gives you a value of 440, which is less than your outside offer of 728.\n\n- **Potential Counteroffers:** Here's the evaluation of some potential counteroffers:\n\n  For example, let's try keeping [3, 3, 2, 0, 3] items (give [0, 1, 3, 0, 0] to Player 1):\n  - My Value:\n    - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 35 = 105\n    - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195\n    - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 85 = 170\n    - 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 56 = 0\n    - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150\n\n  Total value = 105 + 195 + 170 + 0 + 150 = 620, which is still less than your outside offer.\n\nContinuing similar iterations won't likely reach a value of 728 because the item pool is limited, indicating you will likely have to decide on near-full offers of the most valuable items (e.g., most of item 3) to achieve a value nearing your outside offer.\n\n### 3) Decision Making:\n\n- **Accept Current Offer?** No, accepting provides 440, less than 728.\n\n- **Walk Away?** If further splitting doesn't provide a sufficient alternative\u2014yes.\n\n- **Propose Counteroffer:** Let's try a fair division that maximizes your critical items or crucial offers, for example: keeping majority item 3 units due to high value.\n\n- My Offer to Player 1:\n  - Offer [0, 0, 2, 0, 0] hence keep [3, 4, 3, 0, 3]:\n  - Value to you:\n    - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 35 = 105\n    - 4 units of item 2 = 4 \u00d7 65 = 260\n    - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 85 = 255\n    - 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 56 = 0\n    - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150\n  Total = 105 + 260 + 255 + 0 + 150 = 770, more than your outside offer with a value advantage.\n\nGiven this calculation, you can make a strategic COUNTEROFFER:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 2, 0, 0]}\n```\n\nThis ensures you maintain higher value items and maximize your offer over your outside option while avoiding critical negotiation errors like settling under your outside offer effectively.",

I should keep most of the high-value items (especially item 5) while offering some of the lower-value items to create a balanced offer.\n\nLet me craft a strategic initial offer:\n- I'll give Player 2: 2 units of item 1, 7 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5\n- This means I keep: 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5\n\nValue of what I keep:\n- 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (item 1)\n- 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (item 2)\n- 1 \u00d7 24 = 24 (item 3)\n- 2 \u00d7 36 = 72 (item 4)\n- 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (item 5)\n- Total: 612\n\nThis is significantly higher than my outside offer of 178, so it's a good initial offer. If the other player accepts, I'll get 612 value, which is much better than my outside option.\n\nI'm offering some of each item to show willingness to negotiate while keeping more of the items I value most (items 1 and 5).

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 3, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    20 x 0 + 77 x 3 + 50 x 3 + 76 x 1 + 70 x 0\n    which is 457 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 458. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 4, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 4, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

This is what I would get:\n- 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 33 = 33\n- 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 94 = 94\n- 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 25 = 50\n- 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 64 = 64\n- 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 43 = 0\n- Total value = 241 \u00d7 0.98 (discount) = 236.18\n\nThis is much higher than my outside offer of 83.\n\nLet me compare it to my original offer (what I'd get if my first offer was accepted):\n- 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 33 = 66\n- 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 94 = 188\n- 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 25 = 25\n- 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 64 = 64\n- 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 43 = 43\n- Total value = 386\n\nPlayer 2's counteroffer gives me less value than my initial offer, but it's still much better than my outside offer.\n\nLet me consider a potential counteroffer. Based on Player 2's offer, they seem to value item 5 more than other items (they offered me none of it). I should try to keep more of item 2 (my highest value item) and more of item 4, while possibly giving up more of item 3 (my lowest value).\n\nPotential counteroffer (what I'd give to Player 2):\n- 2 units of item 1\n- 1 unit of item 2 (keeping 2 for myself which are high value)\n- 3 units of item 3 (I value this least)\n- 1 unit of item 4 (keeping 1 for myself)\n- 1 unit of item 5 (keeping 1 for myself)\n\nIf this counteroffer is accepted, I would keep:\n- 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 33 = 66\n- 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 94 = 188\n- 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 25 = 50\n- 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 64 = 64\n- 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 43 = 43\n- Total value = 411 \u00d7 0.98^2 (potential discount in next round) = 395.1\n\n## Step 3: Make a decision\n\nI have three options:\n1. Accept Player 2's offer: Value = 236.18\n2. Walk away: Value = 83\n3. Make a counteroffer [2, 1, 3, 1, 1]: Expected value around 395.1 (if accepted next round)\n\nPlayer 2's offer is significantly better than my outside offer (236.18 > 83), so I shouldn't walk away.\n\nHowever, I believe I can improve my position with a reasonable counteroffer. My proposed counteroffer would give me a better value than accepting now, even with another round of discount.\n\nI'll make a counteroffer of [2, 1, 3, 1, 1], which gives Player 2 fair consideration while optimizing my potential value.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 3, 1, 1]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 46. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1152 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    84 x 0 + 100 x 0 + 65 x 0 + 50 x 0 + 85 x 0\n    which is 0 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 46. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Let's break down the decision-making process step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n- **Outside Offer Value:** 189\n- **Values of the Items:**\n  - Item 1: 25 per unit\n  - Item 2: 71 per unit\n  - Item 3: 66 per unit\n  - Item 4: 89 per unit\n  - Item 5: 33 per unit\n- **Total Pool of Items:**\n  - 8 units of item 1\n  - 3 units of item 2\n  - 2 units of item 3\n  - 0 units of item 4\n  - 5 units of item 5\n- **Discount Factor:** Since this is round 1, the discount factor doesn't apply yet; it impacts future rounds by reducing the effective value through gamma to the power (r-1).\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n- **Current Offer:** [2, 0, 1, 0, 1]\n  - Calculate my value if I accept:\n    - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 25 = 50\n    - 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 71 = 0\n    - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 66 = 66\n    - 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 89 = 0\n    - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 33 = 33\n    - Total value if I accept = 50 + 0 + 66 + 0 + 33 = 149\n\n- **Comparison with Outside Offer Value:**\n  - The value of accepting the current offer (149) is less than my outside offer (189).\n\n- **Potential Counteroffers:**\n  - Aim for a counteroffer where my value exceeds 189.\n  - Example Counteroffer: [3, 1, 0, 0, 3]\n    - Value assessment:\n      - 5 units of item 1 for me = 5 \u00d7 25 = 125\n      - 2 units of item 2 for me = 2 \u00d7 71 = 142\n      - 2 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 66 = 0 (I keep none)\n      - 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 89 = 0\n      - 2 units of item 5 for me = 2 \u00d7 33 = 66\n      - Total value = 125 + 142 + 0 + 0 + 66 = 333\n    - Offer to Player 1: [3, 1, 2, 0, 3]\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nGiven the calculations, the current offer (value 149) is worse than my outside offer value (189). Therefore, accepting it would be mistake 4. I need to propose a counteroffer that maximizes my value above 189.\n\nBased on this analysis, I'll propose the counteroffer calculated above:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 1, 2, 0, 3]}\n```\n\nThis action ensures my offer aligns with my strategic objectives, avoiding the common mistakes outlined earlier.",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 46. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1152 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    84 x 0 + 100 x 0 + 65 x 0 + 50 x 0 + 85 x 0\n    which is 0 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 46. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 1, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 1, 2, 0, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 1, 2, 0, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 7, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    48 x 0 + 84 x 0 + 67 x 1 + 64 x 7 + 95 x 0\n    which is 515 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 516. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

It's also a reasonable opening offer that gives some items to Player 2, avoiding mistake #3 of offering nothing or everything.\n\nThe offer doesn't fall into any of the five mistake categories:\n- It's my first offer, so can't be worse than my previous offer\n- It's worth more to me (1121) than my outside offer (516)\n- I'm offering some items, not none or all\n- I'm not accepting anything yet\n- I'm not walking away from a good offer\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 2, 1, 7, 1]}",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 0, 3, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    53 x 1 + 64 x 1 + 57 x 0 + 9 x 3 + 88 x 0\n    which is 144 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 145. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Yes, significantly better\n- Am I offering some of each item type? Yes\n- Am I offering a reasonable amount to Player 2? Yes, I'm giving them more than half the units (12 out of 24)\n\nThis seems like a good initial offer.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 4, 2, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    25 x 1 + 53 x 0 + 85 x 4 + 86 x 2 + 78 x 5\n    which is 927 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 928. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 341. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 341. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 567 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 2, 0, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    22 x 0 + 61 x 0 + 10 x 2 + 16 x 0 + 80 x 4\n    which is 340 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 341. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [4, 2, 4, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 2, 2, 1, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [4, 1, 4, 1, 1]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [2, 2, 0, 0, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 2, 0, 0, 4]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "I need to analyze the current offer from Player 2 and decide on my best course of action. Let me approach this systematically.\n\n### 1) Current Situation Analysis\n\n- My outside offer value: 341\n- My values per unit: 22 for item 1, 61 for item 2, 10 for item 3, 16 for item 4, 80 for item 5\n- Total items: 6 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5\n- Current discount factor: 0.98^(3-1) = 0.98^2 = 0.9604 (as we're in round 3)\n- If I accept or walk away now, my value will be multiplied by 0.9604\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of the Current Offer\n\nPlayer 2 is offering me [2, 2, 0, 0, 4], meaning I would keep [4, 3, 5, 2, 2].\n\nThe value to me of keeping these items would be:\n- 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 22 = 88\n- 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183\n- 5 units of item 3 = 5 \u00d7 10 = 50\n- 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 16 = 32\n- 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 80 = 160\n\nTotal value = 88 + 183 + 50 + 32 + 160 = 513\n\nAfter applying the discount factor: 513 \u00d7 0.9604 = 492.7\n\nThis is significantly higher than my outside offer of 341.\n\n### 3) Consider Possible Counteroffers\n\nLooking at the negotiation history, Player 2 seems to value items 1, 2, and 5 more than items 3 and 4. They're willing to give me all of items 3 and 4.\n\nIf I make a counteroffer, we'll be entering an even higher discount rate. Let me consider what I might offer:\n\nOne potential counteroffer: [3, 2, 5, 2, 2] - keeping [3, 3, 0, 0, 4] for myself\nValue to me would be: 3\u00d722 + 3\u00d761 + 0\u00d710 + 0\u00d716 + 4\u00d780 = 66 + 183 + 0 + 0 + 320 = 569\n\nAfter applying the potential next round discount (0.98\u00b3): 569 \u00d7 0.941 = 535.4\n\nHowever, there's a high risk at this point. This is round 3, which means if Player 2 makes a counteroffer instead of accepting, it will be treated as a WALK, and I'll get my outside offer (341) instead of the current 492.7.\n\n### 4) Decision Making\n\nComparing options:\n- Accepting the current offer: 492.7 value (much higher than my outside offer)\n- Making a new counteroffer: Risk losing the deal entirely\n- Walking away: 341 value (worse than accepting)\n\nGiven that:\n1. The current offer gives me 492.7, which is significantly better than my outside offer of 341\n2. This is the final round, so any counteroffer from Player 2 would be treated as a walk\n3. The items I'm keeping align with my highest values (especially keeping most of item 2 which has a high value of 61)\n\nThe most rational choice is to accept the current offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

                    "response": "To make an informed decision, let's go through the step-by-step analysis process.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n1. **Outside Offer Value:**  \n   My outside offer value is 730.\n\n2. **Values of the Items Involved:**  \n   - Item 1: 15 per unit  \n   - Item 2: 5 per unit  \n   - Item 3: 66 per unit  \n   - Item 4: 62 per unit  \n   - Item 5: 96 per unit  \n\n3. **Total Pool of Items:**  \n   - 4 units of item 1  \n   - 6 units of item 2  \n   - 8 units of item 3  \n   - 4 units of item 4  \n   - 4 units of item 5  \n\n4. **Discount Factor:**  \n   Since it is round 1, the discount factor is not yet applied. The future payoff would be subject to a discount of \\( \\gamma^{(r-1)} \\) (0.98 in this round), but in this case, r is 1, so the discount does not affect presently.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n1. **Current Offer:**  \n   Offered to me: [3, 2, 2, 3, 1]  \n   My value calculation:\n   - \\( 3 \\times 15 = 45 \\) (item 1)\n   - \\( 2 \\times 5 = 10 \\) (item 2)\n   - \\( 2 \\times 66 = 132 \\) (item 3)\n   - \\( 3 \\times 62 = 186 \\) (item 4)\n   - \\( 1 \\times 96 = 96 \\) (item 5)\n\n   Total value of the current offer = 45 + 10 + 132 + 186 + 96 = 469\n\n2. **Comparison to Outside Offer:**  \n   The total value of the current offer (469) is less than my outside offer (730). Therefore, accepting the current offer would be worse than taking my outside offer.\n\n3. **Potential Counteroffers:**  \n   Let's consider a counteroffer where I retain a combination with a higher value than my outside offer:\n   - Let's keep [4, 4, 6, 3, 2] and offer Player 1 the rest ([0, 2, 2, 1, 2]).\n   \n   My value calculation:\n   - \\( 4 \\times 15 = 60 \\) (item 1)\n   - \\( 4 \\times 5 = 20 \\) (item 2)\n   - \\( 6 \\times 66 = 396 \\) (item 3)\n   - \\( 3 \\times 62 = 186 \\) (item 4)\n   - \\( 2 \\times 96 = 192 \\) (item 5)\n\n   Total value of potential counteroffer = 60 + 20 + 396 + 186 + 192 = 854\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nSince the current offer is worse than my outside offer, I should not accept it. A potential counteroffer that gives me a value of 854 is better than my outside offer. I should propose this counteroffer as it is more advantageous for me compared to both the current offer and my outside fallback.\n\nTherefore, I will make the following action:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 2, 1, 2]}",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 5, 6, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party.

The immediate value of accepting or counteroffering in this round should be compared to the outside offer.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer from Player 1**: [1, 4, 0, 1, 4]\n  - Value calculation if you accept this offer:\n    - Item 1: 69 x 1 = 69\n    - Item 2: 45 x 4 = 180\n    - Item 3: 6 x 0 = 0\n    - Item 4: 28 x 1 = 28\n    - Item 5: 83 x 4 = 332\n    - Total: 69 + 180 + 0 + 28 + 332 = 609\n\n- **Comparison**:\n  - The value of the current offer (609) is far greater than the outside offer (114), so accepting would be beneficial compared to the outside offer.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\n- **Should I Accept the Current Offer?**\n  - Since the current offer's value (609) significantly exceeds your outside offer (114), accepting it would be a rational decision.\n\n- **Should I Walk Away?**\n  - No, walking away would result in only receiving the outside offer value of 114, which is much lower than 609.\n\n- **Should I Propose a Counteroffer?**\n  - There's little incentive to make a counteroffer, as the current offer is already highly favorable and exceeds the value of the outside offer by a large margin.\n\nGiven this analysis, accepting the current offer is the rational choice to maximize your outcome.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 77. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 225 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 2, 0, 1, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    1 x 1 + 26 x 2 + 32 x 0 + 9 x 1 + 7 x 2\n    which is 76 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 77. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

However, I should propose an offer that has a better chance of being accepted while still being advantageous to me.\n\nLet me try one more iteration:\n- Item 1: 0 units (keeping all 3)\n- Item 2: 1 unit (keeping 4)\n- Item 3: 1 unit (keeping 3)\n- Item 4: 0 units (keeping all 5)\n- Item 5: 1 unit (keeping 1)\n\nLet me calculate the value of what I keep:\n- Item 1: 3 \u00d7 76 = 228\n- Item 2: 4 \u00d7 63 = 252\n- Item 3: 3 \u00d7 79 = 237\n- Item 4: 5 \u00d7 95 = 475\n- Item 5: 1 \u00d7 42 = 42\nTotal value to me: 1234\n\nThis is a more balanced offer that's still above my outside offer (1234 > 1273).

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 5, 4, 4, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    42 x 1 + 34 x 5 + 73 x 4 + 11 x 4 + 49 x 2\n    which is 646 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 647. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Let me refine the offer further:\n\n   - Let's adjust to keep [3, 5, 3, 5, 1] and offer [0, 0, 1, 0, 1] to Player 1\n     - Value of keeping [3, 5, 3, 5, 1]:\n       - Item 1: 3 \u00d7 42 = 126\n       - Item 2: 5 \u00d7 34 = 170\n       - Item 3: 3 \u00d7 73 = 219\n       - Item 4: 5 \u00d7 11 = 55\n       - Item 5: 1 \u00d7 49 = 49\n     - Total value = 126 + 170 + 219 + 55 + 49 = 619\n\nIt again doesn't surpass the outside offer. \n\nThe first round allows for gains, hence prompt a rational counter for settlement:\n\n    - Let\u2019s further consider a split keeping [3, 5, 3, 5, 2] to closely approach without surpassing 741 as this will achieve 647:\n       - Value of keeping [3, 5, 3, 5, 2]:\n          - Item 1: 3 \u00d7 42 = 126\n          - Item 2: 5 \u00d7 34 = 170\n          - Item 3: 3 \u00d7 73 = 219\n          - Item 4: 5 \u00d7 11 = 55\n          - Item 5: 2 \u00d7 49 = 98\n       - Total value = 126 + 170 + 219 + 55 + 98 = 668\n\nNow it is a viable counteroffer where the value exceeds the outside offer.\n\nTherefore, I will make a counteroffer that optimizes my result:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]}",

                    "response": "I need to analyze the current situation and make a strategic decision. Let's work through this step by step.\n\n## 1) Current Situation Analysis\n\n- My outside offer value: 1273\n- My item values: 76 for item 1, 63 for item 2, 79 for item 3, 95 for item 4, 42 for item 5\n- Total pool: 3 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5\n- Discount factor: 0.98 (currently in round 2, so any agreement will be worth 0.98 times the nominal value)\n\n## 2) Assessment of Current Offer\n\nPlayer 2 is offering me [0, 0, 1, 0, 0], meaning I would keep:\n- 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228\n- 5 units of item 2 = 5 \u00d7 63 = 315\n- 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237\n- 5 units of item 4 = 5 \u00d7 95 = 475\n- 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 42 = 84\n\nTotal value: 1339\n\nWith discount factor: 1339 \u00d7 0.98 = 1312.22\n\nThis is better than my outside offer of 1273.\n\n## 3) Analysis of Previous Offers\n\nIn round 1, I offered Player 2 [0, 1, 1, 0, 1], keeping [3, 4, 3, 5, 1] for myself, worth:\n- 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (item 1)\n- 4 \u00d7 63 = 252 (item 2)\n- 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (item 3)\n- 5 \u00d7 95 = 475 (item 4)\n- 1 \u00d7 42 = 42 (item 5)\n\nTotal: 1234\n\nPlayer 2 countered by asking for less - only 1 unit of item 3. This suggests they may value item 3 highly, while the items I offered initially (items 2 and 5) may be less valuable to them.\n\n## 4) Decision Making\n\nCurrent offer evaluation: The current offer gives me 1312.22 value (with discount), which is higher than my outside offer of 1273.\n\nI could make a counteroffer, but:\n1. The deal already exceeds my outside offer\n2. If negotiations extend to round 3, further discounting will reduce value\n3. Player 2's offer suggests they primarily want item 3, which isn't my highest-value item\n\nAccepting this offer seems reasonable since:\n- It gives me all units of my most valuable items (items 1 and 4)\n- I'm only giving up 1 unit of item 3, keeping 3\n- The discounted value (1312.22) exceeds my outside offer (1273)\n- Further negotiation could risk deterioration of value through discounting\n\nTherefore, I will accept the current offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

Your value would be:\n    77 x 5 + 49 x 0 + 34 x 1 + 53 x 2 + 68 x 3\n    which is 729 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 730. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 4, 2, 6, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    25 x 2 + 3 x 4 + 93 x 2 + 3 x 6 + 91 x 2\n    which is 448 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 449. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 5, 5, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 2, 5, 5, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Here's the step-by-step analysis:\n\n### Step 1: Current Situation Analysis\n\n- **My outside offer value:** 449.\n- **Values of the items involved:**\n  - Item 1: 25 per unit\n  - Item 2: 3 per unit\n  - Item 3: 93 per unit\n  - Item 4: 3 per unit\n  - Item 5: 91 per unit\n- **Total pool of items:**\n  - 6 units of item 1\n  - 5 units of item 2\n  - 5 units of item 3\n  - 6 units of item 4\n  - 5 units of item 5\n- **Discount Factor:** The discount rate is 0.98, which affects the value of outcomes if concluded in later rounds.\n\n### Step 2: Assessing the Offer\n\n- **Value of the current offer (what I'm being offered):**\n  - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 25 = 50\n  - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 3 = 6\n  - 5 units of item 3 = 5 \u00d7 93 = 465\n  - 5 units of item 4 = 5 \u00d7 3 = 15\n  - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 91 = 0\n  - **Total value if I accept:** 50 + 6 + 465 + 15 + 0 = 536\n\n- **Comparison to outside offer:**\n  - The current offer value (536) is greater than my outside offer value (449). Therefore, it would be a mistake to walk away from this offer as it provides a higher value to me than my guaranteed alternative.\n\n### Step 3: Decision Making\n\n- **ACCEPT:** The current offer gives me a total value of 536, which is above my outside offer value of 449. Therefore, I should accept the current offer to maximize my payoff.\n\nGiven the value calculations and comparison, my best course of action is to accept the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 2, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

I want to keep items with high value to me while offering a reasonable deal to the other player. \n\nSince I highly value items 1 and 5, I should keep most of those. Items 2, 3, and 4 have much lower value to me, so I can offer those.\n\nI'll go with the offer I calculated above: [1, 2, 3, 1, 0] to Player 2. This gives them most of the lower-value items (to me) while I keep most of the high-value items, particularly all of item 5 and most of item 1.\n\nThis leaves me with items valued at 485, which is much better than my outside offer of 169.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 3, 1, 0]}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 1, 2, 5, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    32 x 2 + 9 x 1 + 99 x 2 + 39 x 5 + 15 x 1\n    which is 481 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 482. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 482. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 582 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 1, 2, 5, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    32 x 2 + 9 x 1 + 99 x 2 + 39 x 5 + 15 x 1\n    which is 481 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 482. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 1, 1, 4, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 2, 1, 2, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [3, 1, 1, 5, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 1, 1, 5, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

The discount factor is \\( \\gamma = 0.98 \\). No matter how the negotiation continues, the outcome value will be multiplied by \\(\\gamma^{r-1}\\). If the offer is accepted now in round 2, the value needs to be adjusted by \\(\\gamma = 0.98\\).\n\n### Step 2: Assess the value of offers\n\n- **Current offer: [3, 1, 1, 5, 0]**\n  - Value to me:\n    - Item 1: \\(3 \\times 32 = 96\\)\n    - Item 2: \\(1 \\times 9 = 9\\)\n    - Item 3: \\(1 \\times 99 = 99\\)\n    - Item 4: \\(5 \\times 39 = 195\\)\n    - Item 5: \\(0 \\times 15 = 0\\)\n  - Total value = \\(96 + 9 + 99 + 195 + 0 = 399\\)\n  - Adjusted value = \\(399 \\times 0.98 = 391.02\\)\n\n- **Comparison to outside offer:**\n  - The adjusted value of the current offer (391.02) is less than my outside offer (482).\n\n- **Potential counteroffers:** I need to form a counteroffer that provides me with a value higher than my outside offer (482). Let\u2019s assess a few divisions:\n\n  - **Propose myself [2, 2, 4, 2, 1] (leave to Player 1 [2, 1, 2, 5, 1]):**\n    - Item 1: \\(2 \\times 32 = 64\\)\n    - Item 2: \\(2 \\times 9 = 18\\)\n    - Item 3: \\(4 \\times 99 = 396\\)\n    - Item 4: \\(2 \\times 39 = 78\\)\n    - Item 5: \\(1 \\times 15 = 15\\)\n    - Total value = \\(64 + 18 + 396 + 78 + 15 = 571\\)\n    - Adjusted value = \\(571 \\times 0.98 = 559.58\\) (better than outside offer)\n\n### Step 3: Make a decision\n\nGiven the analysis:\n- **Accept current offer?** No, as its adjusted value (391.02) is less than the value of the outside offer (482).\n- **Walk away?** Not yet, as an acceptable counteroffer can be proposed.\n- **Counteroffer:** Propose a revised counteroffer to ensure a better return than the outside offer.\n\nTherefore, my decision is:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 2, 5, 1]}\n```",

                    "prompt": "\n    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\n    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\n    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\n    There are 5 units of item 1, 8 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\n    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\n    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 101.\n    Your private values are 40 for item 1, 26 for item 2, 51 for item 3, 19 for item 4, 49 for item 5.\n    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to your total value of all items, which is 869. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 195. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 195. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 555 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 1, 1, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    40 x 0 + 26 x 1 + 51 x 1 + 19 x 1 + 49 x 2\n    which is 194 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 195. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 5, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 2, 5, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?
