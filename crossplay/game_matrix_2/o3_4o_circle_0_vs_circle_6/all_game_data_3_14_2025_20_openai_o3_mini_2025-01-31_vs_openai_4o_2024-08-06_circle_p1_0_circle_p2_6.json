We note that my total private value for all the items is 1219, but my outside offer is 818, so any deal I accept must give me at least 818 in my own valuation.\n2. My unit values are: item\u202f1 = 19, item\u202f2 = 52, item\u202f3 = 89, item\u202f4 = 78, item\u202f5 = 49. Thus my \u201chigh\u2010value\u201d items are item\u202f3 and item\u202f4.\n3. One natural strategy is to reserve for myself the items that give me the most value while offering enough to Player\u00a02 so they also get a deal that likely beats their own outside offer.\n4. By taking all of item\u202f3 and item\u202f4, I obtain 6\u00d789 + 4\u00d778 = 534 + 312 = 846, which is above my fallback value of 818.\n5. With that strategy, I offer Player\u00a02 everything else \u2013 namely, all 4 units of item\u202f1, the only unit of item\u202f2, and all 5 units of item\u202f5.\n6. This offer is valid (does not exceed available units for each item) and allocates all items.\n7. Given that it is round 1 and no discounting has occurred yet, this aggressive but \u201cefficient\u201d initial counteroffer both secures me a value above my outside option and gives Player\u00a02 a complete package of the remaining items that they may find acceptable relative to their uncertain outside offer.\n\nThus, my action is to propose this division.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 1, 0, 0, 5]}",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 360. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 360. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 504 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 1, 0, 4, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    51 x 3 + 82 x 1 + 4 x 0 + 19 x 4 + 12 x 4\n    which is 359 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 360. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [4, 1, 0, 0, 5]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [4, 1, 0, 0, 5]\n\n    What is your action?

I know my own per\u2010unit values:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003item 1 = 6\u2003\u2003(item1 total = 5)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003item 2 = 47\u2003 (total = 3)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003item 3 = 75\u2003 (total = 5)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003item 4 = 17\u2003 (total = 4)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003item 5 = 49\u2003 (total = 5)\n\nBecause I value item 3 (75) and item 2 (47) and item 5 (49) considerably more than I do item 1 (6) and item 4 (17), I want to \u201cbuy cheap\u201d by giving most or all of item 1 and item 4 to Player 2 while retaining nearly all of the higher\u2010value items for myself. (Remember, the offer is described by how many units of each item I propose to give to Player 2; what I keep is the rest.)\n\nAlso, I must give Player 2 at least what they expect from their own outside option. Although I don\u2019t know their actual values, a rough \u201cback\u2010of\u2010the\u2010envelope\u201d is as follows. Under the assumption that for any item a \u201ctypical\u201d per\u2010unit value might average roughly (1+101)/2 = 51, if I were to give Player 2 only item 1 (5 units) and item 4 (4 units) they would get roughly 5\u00d751 + 4\u00d751 = 459 points in expected value. But we know that Player 2\u2019s outside offer (drawn uniformly from 1 up to their total value) has an expected relative value that is roughly half their total (and so often higher than 459 on average). To make their deal slightly preferable to \u201cwalking away,\u201d I need to boost their share on at least one of the other items.\n\nWith that in mind I consider this division:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Give them all of item 1 (all 5 units) and all of item 4 (all 4 units) \u2013 since these items aren\u2019t very valuable to me.\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Also give them 2 out of the 3 units of item 2 so they get extra value (while I keep 1 unit, which still nets me 47).\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Keep all of item 3 (since it is my most valuable, 75 per unit).\n\u2003\u2022\u2003On item 5 (value 49), a small concession of 1 unit (giving them 1) will further sweeten the deal; I then keep 4 units.\n\nLet\u2019s check that the offer is valid:\n\u2003\u2013 For item 1: Offer 5 (total 5)\u2003\u2713\n\u2003\u2013 Item 2: Offer 2 (total 3)\u2003\u2713\n\u2003\u2013 Item 3: Offer 0 (total 5)\u2003\u2713\n\u2003\u2013 Item 4: Offer 4 (total 4)\u2003\u2713\n\u2003\u2013 Item 5: Offer 1 (total 5)\u2003\u2713\n\nNow, what do both sides get (using my known values for myself and a rough 51 per unit for Player 2 as a proxy for \u201ctypical\u201d values)?\n\nMy share (what I keep):\n\u2003\u2022\u2003item 1: 0 units\u2003 (0)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003item 2: 1 unit\u2003 (1\u00d747 = 47)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003item 3: 5 units\u2003 (5\u00d775 = 375)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003item 4: 0 units\u2003 (0)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003item 5: 4 units\u2003 (4\u00d749 = 196)\n\u2003\u2003Total value for me = 47 + 375 + 196 = 618\u2003> my outside option (326)\n\nFor Player 2 (using approximate average values):\n\u2003\u2022\u2003item 1: 5 units\u2003 (\u22485\u00d751 = 255)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003item 2: 2 units\u2003 (\u22482\u00d751 = 102)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003item 3: 0\u2003 (0)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003item 4: 4 units\u2003 (\u22484\u00d751 = 204)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003item 5: 1 unit\u2003 (\u22481\u00d751 = 51)\n\u2003\u2003Estimated total \u2248 255 + 102 + 204 + 51 = 612\n\nThis division rewards Player 2 with roughly 612 points (in expectation using common averages), which \u2013 while not guaranteed \u2013 is likely to be above their outside option if they are risk\u2010neutral. In addition, by keeping almost all of item 3 and a good portion of the items I value highly, I end up with a solid 618 utility (with no discount loss, since it\u2019s round 1).\n\nThus, I believe this division will be acceptable to Player 2 and maximizes my benefit relative to what I risk losing if a negotiation goes on. \n\nMy answer, in the required format, is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [5, 2, 0, 4, 1]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 504. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1026 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 2, 1, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    41 x 0 + 79 x 2 + 78 x 2 + 99 x 1 + 45 x 2\n    which is 503 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 504. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [5, 2, 0, 4, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [5, 2, 0, 4, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Step\u2010by\u2010step reasoning:\n1. We first note our own total value if we received all items is 640. Our private outside option gives us 210, so any deal we agree to should be above 210 in our own eyes.\n2. Our per\u2010unit values are much higher on item 3 (72) and item 5 (64) than on items 1 (19) and 4 (17), so we prefer to keep items 3 and 5. We also value item 2 at 48 per unit so we would like to keep some of that as well.\n3. In contrast, items 1 and 4 have the lowest value for us and we can \u201cconcede\u201d them in order to give Player\u00a02 enough incentive. Although we do not know Player\u00a02\u2019s exact private values, they are uniformly drawn between 1 and 101 so that on average each unit is worth roughly 51 to them. In expectation, Player\u00a02\u2019s total value for all items is considerably higher than ours; however, their outside offer on average is about half that total.\n4. In a three\u2010round negotiation the players discount later deals (with \u03b3 = 0.98), so an early agreement is more valuable. We want to offer Player\u00a02 just enough that, in expectation, the items they receive from our proposal provide them roughly what they might expect from their own outside option.\n5. Noting that the \u201cconcession\u201d items (items 1, 2 and 4) for us total 4 + 3 + 4 = 11 units, we want to give Player\u00a02 approximately 8 units (since 8 \u00d7 ~51 \u2248 408, which is in the neighborhood of a fair expected outside value for them). Since we especially want to keep item 2 (worth 48 to us) and favor giving away the lower\u2010value items (item 1 at 19 and item 4 at 17), we propose allocating all of both items 1 and 4 (4 + 4 = 8 total units) to Player\u00a02.\n6. With that proposal, our allocation is as follows:\n\u2003\u2022 For item 1 (4 available): 0 for us, 4 for Player\u00a02.\n\u2003\u2022 For item 2 (3 available): all 3 for us.\n\u2003\u2022 For item 3 (4 available): all 4 for us.\n\u2003\u2022 For item 4 (4 available): 0 for us, 4 for Player\u00a02.\n\u2003\u2022 For item 5 (1 available): all 1 for us.\n7. Our resulting value is:\n\u2003Item 1: 0 \u00d7 19 = 0\n\u2003Item 2: 3 \u00d7 48 = 144\n\u2003Item 3: 4 \u00d7 72 = 288\n\u2003Item 4: 0 \u00d7 17 = 0\n\u2003Item 5: 1 \u00d7 64 = 64\n\u2003Total = 144 + 288 + 64 = 496, which is well above our outside option.\n8. Meanwhile, Player\u00a02\u2019s offer is the entire items 1 and 4. For an opponent with average item valuations (~51 per unit) this yields an expected value of roughly 8 \u00d7 51 = 408 \u2013 a plausible incentive to accept rather than delay.\n9. This proposal keeps our high\u2010value items while offering Player\u00a02 nearly the minimum they would expect relative to their outside alternative (and accounting for discounting if negotiations drag on).\n\nBased on the above reasoning, in round 1 we propose the following offer to Player 2:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 0, 0, 4, 0]}",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 2, 3, 4, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    57 x 3 + 35 x 2 + 88 x 3 + 35 x 4 + 29 x 0\n    which is 645 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 647. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [4, 0, 0, 4, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [4, 0, 0, 4, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To determine the best course of action, let's walk through the steps:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 647.\n   - My values per unit for each item are:\n     - Item 1: 57\n     - Item 2: 35\n     - Item 3: 88\n     - Item 4: 35\n     - Item 5: 29\n   - Total pool of items: [4, 3, 4, 4, 1]\n   - Discount factor (gamma) influences the decision since the negotiation value decreases by a factor of \\(0.98^{0}\\) (1) in the first round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer from Player 1: [4, 0, 0, 4, 0]\n     - My value if I accept the current offer (keeping [0, 3, 4, 0, 1] for myself):\n       - Item 1: 0 units = 0 x 57 = 0\n       - Item 2: 3 units = 3 x 35 = 105\n       - Item 3: 4 units = 4 x 88 = 352\n       - Item 4: 0 units = 0 x 35 = 0\n       - Item 5: 1 unit  = 1 x 29 = 29\n       - Total value = 486, which is less than my outside offer of 647.\n   \n   - Potential Counteroffer:\n     Let's aim to construct an offer that gives me more value than 647. \n     For example, consider the distribution: [0, 3, 2, 3, 1] (what I keep):\n     - Item 1: 0 units = 0 x 57 = 0\n     - Item 2: 3 units = 3 x 35 = 105\n     - Item 3: 2 units = 2 x 88 = 176\n     - Item 4: 3 units = 3 x 35 = 105\n     - Item 5: 1 unit  = 1 x 29 = 29\n     - Total value = 415, which is also less than 647.\n\n     Let's try [1, 3, 3, 3, 0] (what I keep):\n     - Item 1: 1 units = 1 x 57 = 57\n     - Item 2: 3 units = 3 x 35 = 105\n     - Item 3: 3 units = 3 x 88 = 264\n     - Item 4: 3 units = 3 x 35 = 105\n     - Item 5: 0 units = 0 x 29 = 0\n     - Total value = 531, still below 647.\n\n     Try [2, 3, 3, 3, 1] (what I keep):\n     - Item 1: 2 units = 2 x 57 = 114\n     - Item 2: 3 units = 3 x 35 = 105\n     - Item 3: 3 units = 3 x 88 = 264\n     - Item 4: 3 units = 3 x 35 = 105\n     - Item 5: 1 unit  = 1 x 29 = 29\n     - Total value = 617, still below 647.\n\n     Finally, try [2, 2, 3, 3, 1] (what I keep, and thus [2, 1, 1, 1, 0] is offered to Player 1):\n     - Item 1: 2 units = 2 x 57 = 114\n     - Item 2: 2 units = 2 x 35 = 70\n     - Item 3: 3 units = 3 x 88 = 264\n     - Item 4: 3 units = 3 x 35 = 105\n     - Item 5: 1 unit  = 1 x 29 = 29\n     - Total value = 582, which doesn't cross 647 either.\n\n   Since none of these distributions exceed 647 without leaving too few items to offer Player 1, I should carefully consider a later counter, since any valid option within the limits of [2, 1, 1, 1, 0] still appears nominal.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n   - Accepting the current offer gives me less value (486) than my outside offer (647).\n   - Walking away guarantees me a value of 647.\n   - At this moment, given that the potential counteroffers result in values less than 647, and there's room for further negotiation rounds, a strategic counteroffer is prudent. Nonetheless, none of my counteroffered attempts have surpassed my outside offer calculus suggest a better setup in subsequent discussions.\n\nThus, with strategic foresight intending for higher bid akin positions, the most feasible decision based on this analysis is:\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

In round 1 there is no discount (\u03b3^(1\u20131)=1) so there is no penalty for reaching an agreement immediately. In our case our full\u2010bundle value is 1091 and our outside offer is 535, so any agreement we accept or propose should give us more than 535 (ideally, a \u201cfair\u201d split near 50%\u201350% by our own evaluations, though we\u2019d like a slight advantage given that we are the proposer).\n\nWe have 5 items available in quantities [3, 4, 5, 5, 3] with our values per unit being 60, 100, 40, 25, and 62 respectively. A direct \u201cphysical\u201d fair split is not always possible because of indivisibility (and even when possible the ideal risk\u2010sharing split may favor giving away those items that we value less). Items 1 and 2 are most valuable to us, so we try to keep a larger share there. Meanwhile, items 3, 4, and 5 are relatively less \u201cprecious\u201d for us so we can be more generous with the opponent on those.\n\nA candidate fair division by our own measure is to \u201csplit\u201d the items approximately in half. For example, if we offer to give the opponent:\n\u2003\u2022\u20031 unit of item 1 (leaving us 2 units \u2192 2\u00d760 = 120),\n\u2003\u2022\u20032 units of item 2 (we keep 2; 2\u00d7100 = 200),\n\u2003\u2022\u20033 units of item 3 (we keep 2; 2\u00d740 = 80),\n\u2003\u2022\u20033 units of item 4 (we keep 2; 2\u00d725 = 50), and\n\u2003\u2022\u20031 unit of item 5 (we keep 2; 2\u00d762 = 124),\nthen our own total value becomes 120 + 200 + 80 + 50 + 124 = 574, which is above our outside offer of 535. (Also note that while a more \u201caggressive\u201d offer might try to keep more of items 1 and 2, an offer that is too skewed may not appeal to Player 2.) \n\nBecause player 2\u2019s private values are unknown, offering roughly a \u201cbalanced\u201d allocation by our valuation (while favoring us on items we prize most) seems like a reasonable, negotiation\u2010friendly, initial offer.\n\nThus, my proposed initial offer is to give Player 2: [1, 2, 3, 3, 1] (for items 1 through 5 respectively).\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 3, 3, 1]}",

                    "response": "I want to compare what I would get if I accepted the current offer versus my disagreement option. (1) The offer on the table is [0, 2, 4, 0, 0] (meaning Player 2 is offering me no units of item1, 2 of item2, 4 of item3, none of item4 and item5). Using my private per\u2010unit values I get:\n\u2003\u2003item1: 0\u00d760 = 0  \n\u2003\u2003item2: 2\u00d7100 = 200  \n\u2003\u2003item3: 4\u00d740 = 160  \n\u2003\u2003item4: 0\u00d725 = 0  \n\u2003\u2003item5: 0\u00d762 = 0  \nTotal = 360. In round 2 the discount multiplier is \u03b3 = 0.98 so its present value is about 360\u00d70.98 \u2248 353. \n(2) My private outside offer is 535. If I were to walk the negotiation, I would end up with 535 (or rather 535 discounted appropriately if the discount applies at termination); roughly that is higher than 353. In other words, accepting the current offer is far worse than my disagreement option.\n(3) I therefore want to propose a counteroffer that shifts more of the \u201cpie\u201d in my favor. As Player\u202f1 I propose to offer Player\u202f2 an allocation \u201cX\u201d (a vector) and keep for myself the remainder. (Recall that the total items available are: item1: 3, item2: 4, item3: 5, item4: 5, item5: 3.)\n(4) My goal is to raise my eventual value above my disagreement (outside) outcome. For example, if I give Player\u202f2 the offer [0, 2, 4, 0, 1], then my allocation becomes the complement:\n\u2003\u2003item1: 3\u20130 = 3 units  \n\u2003\u2003item2: 4\u20132 = 2 units  \n\u2003\u2003item3: 5\u20134 = 1 unit  \n\u2003\u2003item4: 5\u20130 = 5 units  \n\u2003\u2003item5: 3\u20131 = 2 units  \nMy total value is then:\n\u2003\u2003item1: 3\u00d760 = 180  \n\u2003\u2003item2: 2\u00d7100 = 200  \n\u2003\u2003item3: 1\u00d740 = 40  \n\u2003\u2003item4: 5\u00d725 = 125  \n\u2003\u2003item5: 2\u00d762 = 124  \nTotal = 180 + 200 + 40 + 125 + 124 = 669. With the discount factor 0.98, the present value is about 669\u00d70.98 \u2248 656.\n(5) This 656 (\u2248656) is much more attractive than 353 from the current offer and also beats the fallback of 535. Although I do not know Player\u202f2\u2019s private values exactly, the proposed counteroffer [0, 2, 4, 0, 1] is only a modest change from his earlier offer (which was [0, 2, 4, 0, 0]) and gives him an extra unit in item5. Thus it is reasonably \u201cgenerous\u201d from his perspective while vastly improving my position.\n(6) I therefore choose to make the counteroffer below.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 4, 0, 1]}",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 1, 2, 5, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    75 x 3 + 24 x 1 + 6 x 2 + 85 x 5 + 86 x 3\n    which is 944 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 947. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 3, 3, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 2, 4, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 4, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 4, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Thus, my \u201craw\u201d value if I obtained a given bundle is the sum over items (quantity \u00d7 per\u2010unit value).\n\n2. The current offer on the table from Player 2 gives me [0, 2, 3, 0, 0]. That means if I accept this deal, I would receive:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 1: 0 units\u2003\u2192\u20030 \u00d7 60 = 0\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 2: 2 units\u2003\u2192\u20032 \u00d7 100 = 200\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 3: 3 units\u2003\u2192\u20033 \u00d7 40 = 120\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 4: 0 units\u2003\u2192\u20030 \u00d7 25 = 0\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 5: 0 units\u2003\u2192\u20030 \u00d7 62 = 0\n\u2003\u2003Total raw value = 200 + 120 = 320.\n\n3. Because we are now in round 3 the deal\u2019s value is discounted by \u03b3^(r\u20131) = 0.98\u00b2 \u2248 0.9604. Thus, the effective value from the deal if accepted is about 320 \u00d7 0.9604 \u2248 307.\n\n4. In contrast, my private outside offer is 535. This means that if I walk away now the final payoff I secure is 535 (with no discounting), which is significantly higher than the 307 I would get by accepting the current offer.\n\n5. Although I could consider making a counteroffer, any counteroffer in round 3 runs the risk that Player 2 may reject it and, by the rules (or by making their counter), they could force a walk away \u2013 leaving me with my outside offer of 535. In negotiation it is never wise to settle for a deal that is worse (even after discounting) than your guaranteed outside option.\n\n6. Since the current offer gives me an effective 307 and crafting a counteroffer that is acceptable to both sides (while guaranteeing me a payoff clearly above 535) is highly uncertain given Player 2\u2019s unknown private values, the best and safest action in this third round is to secure my outside value.\n\nTherefore, my action is to WALK.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

                    "response": "Step\u2010by\u2010step reasoning:\n1. We note that our private values are:\n\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 28 (3 units)\n\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 59 (4 units)\n\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 81 (5 units)\n\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 17 (5 units)\n\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 25 (12 units)\n\u2003giving us a total when taking everything of 1110.\n2. Our outside offer is 252, which is our fallback if negotiations break down. Since we are in round 1 (no discount yet) and the other player has a similar fallback (though with uncertain value), we want to propose an offer that \u201cleaves on the table\u201d a bit of surplus for the other player\u2014i.e. an offer that gives them just enough incentive above their fallback\u2014even though we prefer to keep most of the high\u2010value items.\n3. Knowing our own values, we want to minimize concessions from items we highly prize (especially items 2 and 3) while still offering items that we value less. Item 4 (valued at 17) and item 5 (valued at 25) are ones where concessions hurt us less.\n4. Estimating that a rough \u201cacceptable\u201d offer for Player 2 would yield them a nominal value possibly in the range of 400 when evaluated with an average expected value per item (about 51, given the uniform range 1\u2013101), we determine that offering about 8 total units might suffice. (This is a heuristic: if Player 2\u2019s average per\u2010unit value is around 51, 8 units yield roughly 408, which is above a fallback that might be lower.)\n5. We choose to offer all of our concessions from the items we value relatively less. In this initial offer we propose giving Player 2 3 out of 5 units of item 4 and 5 out of 12 units of item 5. This yields a total of 8 units for Player 2 that, on average, should be competitive with their outside option while preserving the more valuable items (items 1\u20133) for us.\n6. Our resulting counteroffer is that Player 2 receives [0, 0, 0, 3, 5] units (in the order of item 1 through item 5), leaving us with 3,4,5,2,7 units respectively, which gives us a payoff of 3\u00d728 + 4\u00d759 + 5\u00d781 + 2\u00d717 + 7\u00d725 = 924. This is comfortably above our outside offer of 252.\n\nThus, my action is to propose the following initial offer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 3, 5]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 772. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1209 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 4, 7] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    91 x 0 + 94 x 0 + 65 x 0 + 100 x 4 + 53 x 7\n    which is 771 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 772. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This means that the value of the negotiation outcome is discounted based on the number of rounds. Currently, it's round 1, so the value isn't discounted.\n\n### 2) Assess the value of offers:\n\n#### Current Offer: [0, 0, 0, 3, 5]\n- My value for 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300\n- My value for 5 units of item 5 = 5 \u00d7 53 = 265\n- Total value if I accept = 300 + 265 = 565\n\nSince 565 is less than my outside offer of 772, accepting this offer would be worse than taking my outside offer.\n\n#### Potential Counteroffers:\nI need to propose a counteroffer where the value to me is greater than 772 to ensure it's better than my outside offer.\n\nLet's propose keeping more of the high-value items:\n\n- **Keep** 3 units of item 4 and 6 units of item 5\n  - Value for 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300\n  - Value for 6 units of item 5 = 6 \u00d7 53 = 318\n  - Total value = 618, which is less than 772.

In order for the deal to be better than walking, the deal must provide me with a \u201cretained\u201d value of at least 783. In other words, whatever items I \u201ckeep\u201d (i.e. do not give to Player 2) must sum (by my values) to at least 783. Since the total is fixed at 1124, I may \u201cgive away\u201d items worth no more than 1124 \u2013 783 = 341 (by my own assessment).\n\n(3) Because I know my preferences over the items (I value item 1 the lowest at 43 each, then item 5 at 51, then item 4 at 55, etc.), it makes sense to \u201cbuy\u201d extra generosity (i.e. give items away) by sacrificing the items I care least about. In this setting item 1 is my \u201ccheapest\u201d good. Each unit given away costs me only 43 while (if we assume Player 2\u2019s private per\u2010unit value is on the order of an average 51) each unit will \u201clook\u201d roughly worth 51 to him.\n\n(4) I want to maximize my share while making an offer that might \u201centice\u201d Player 2\u2014that is, one that gives him enough expected value (at least roughly his own outside option, though his exact value is private) so that he prefers agreement in round 1 rather than waiting. Because my own outside offer is high, the maximum I can sacrifice (341 in my value terms) is tight. With item 1, 7 units cost 7\u00d743 = 301 (leaving me 40 \u201cpoints\u201d of slack). Increasing to 8 units would cost 344, which would leave me a total of 1124 \u2013 344 = 780, just a bit below my outside option of 783. Hence, a natural initial proposal is \u201cto offer\u201d 7 units of item 1 (and nothing else) to Player 2. Under that offer I receive the rest:\n\u2003\u2022 From item 1: I keep 10 \u2013 7 = 3 units (worth 3\u00d743 = 129)\n\u2003\u2022 And I keep all of items 2, 3, 4, and 5 (adding up to 150 + 65 + 275 + 204 = 694)\ngiving me a total of 129 + 694 = 823, which is above my 783 reservation.\n\n(5) Although I don\u2019t know Player 2\u2019s exact private valuations or outside offer (which is drawn from his own range), expecting that if his draw is \u201clow\u201d then 7 units of item 1\u2014worth (for him, on average) roughly 7\u00d751 = 357\u2014may compare favorably with his outside offer, this initial \u201chardball\u201d offer both secures my minimum and leaves me extra benefit if a deal is reached in round 1.\n\nThus, my action is to make the following counteroffer:\n\u2003Offer to give Player 2 7 units of item 1 and 0 units of items 2 through 5.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [7, 0, 0, 0, 0]}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 0, 2, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    93 x 0 + 28 x 2 + 98 x 0 + 49 x 2 + 71 x 1\n    which is 225 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 234. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "I'll explain my reasoning step\u2010by\u2010step:\n\n1. I first computed the total available units (7, 5, 4, 3, 4) and my own per\u2010unit values:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item1: 39\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item2: 18\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item3: 7\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item4: 68\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item5: 41\n\u2003\u2003so that my total full value is 7\u00d739 + 5\u00d718 + 4\u00d77 + 3\u00d768 + 4\u00d741 = 759.\n\u2003\u2003My outside offer is 125, so any deal I agree to should be worth more than that.\n\n2. In an initial offer I must \u201cbuy\u201d player 2\u2019s acceptance by conceding just enough so that\u2014taking into account that the negotiation continues (with discounting on later rounds) and that player 2\u2019s own outside offer (drawn uniformly up to their total value) might be high\u2014the immediate deal is attractive. Although I do not know player 2\u2019s private values, a common assumption is that their per\u2010unit values on average are around the midpoint (about 51\u200a on average, since the uniform distribution is from 1 to 101). Their expected value for the whole set of items would then be roughly 23\u00d751 \u2248 1173, with an expected outside offer around half of that (about 586).\n\n3. My plan is to concede mostly in the categories that are of lower value to me relative to their likely average value for player 2. In my estimation item2 and item3 are relatively low (18 and 7 per unit). Thus, I\u2019d be inclined to give all of item2\u2019s (5 units) and item3\u2019s (4 units) over. Next, I need to decide how many units of item1 (value 39 each for me) to give up. Since player 2 is likely to attach a higher value per unit (on average approximately 51) than I do, even a small concession may have high \u201cprice\u201d for them (and hence help secure acceptance). I decide to offer 2 units of item1. For item4 (my highest\u2010value item at 68 per unit) I keep all the units so as not to diminish my own gain. For item5 (value 41 for me) I give up a minimal concession of 1 unit.\n\n4. This yields an offer to player 2 of:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item1: 2 units\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item2: 5 units\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item3: 4 units\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item4: 0 units\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item5: 1 unit\n\n\u2003Then my remaining allocation would be:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item1: 7\u20132 = 5\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item2: 0\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item3: 0\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item4: 3\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item5: 4\u20131 = 3\n\n5. My utility from the deal would be:\n\u2003\u2003Item1: 5\u00d739 = 195,\u2003Item4: 3\u00d768 = 204,\u2003Item5: 3\u00d741 = 123;\u2003total = 195+204+123 = 522.\n\u2003For player 2, if we use the assumed average per\u2010unit value (~51), they would roughly \u201csee\u201d a value of:\n\u2003\u2003Item1: 2\u00d751 = 102,\u2003Item2: 5\u00d751 = 255,\u2003Item3: 4\u00d751 = 204,\u2003Item5: 1\u00d751 = 51;\u2003total \u2248 612.\n\u2003This proposed division gives player 2 a bundle that (by our rough estimate) clears the kind of \u201creservation\u201d level they might expect\u2014around or slightly above the midway mark of their potential outcomes\u2014and since this is round 1 there is no discount yet.\n\n6. Thus, the proposed offer strikes a balance: I retain many of the items on which I earn high value (especially item4 and most of item1 and item5) while giving up items where the concession is \u201ccheap\u201d for me and likely attractive to them.\n\nBased on this reasoning, my action this round is to make the following initial offer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 5, 4, 0, 1]}",

The discount factor is gamma^0 = 1, so there is no discount effect in this round.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the value of offers\n\n- **Current offer (if I accept it)**:\n  - I receive: [2, 5, 4, 0, 1]\n  - My total value if I accept it:\n    - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 49 = 98\n    - 5 units of item 2 = 5 \u00d7 46 = 230\n    - 4 units of item 3 = 4 \u00d7 16 = 64\n    - 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 63 = 0\n    - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 63 = 63\n    - **Total value = 98 + 230 + 64 + 0 + 63 = 455**\n\n- **Comparison to outside offer**:\n  - The value of the current offer (455) is less than my outside offer (644).\n\n### Step 3: Make a decision based on the analysis\n\n- **Should I accept the current offer?**\n  - No, because 455 < 644.\n\n- **Should I walk away and take my outside offer?**\n  - Not yet, as it is only round 1, and I still have room to negotiate a better deal.\n\n- **Should I propose a specific counteroffer?**\n  - Yes, I should propose a counteroffer that results in a value > 644 for me.\n\n### Counteroffer Calculation\n\nTo optimize my counteroffer, I need to hold a combination of items that results in a total value greater than my outside offer of 644. Let's calculate one such example:\n\n- Propose [2, 2, 0, 1, 1] offer to Player 1, hence keeping [5, 3, 4, 2, 3] for myself:\n  - My value with this offer:\n    - 5 units of item 1 = 5 \u00d7 49 = 245\n    - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138\n    - 4 units of item 3 = 4 \u00d7 16 = 64\n    - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 63 = 126\n    - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189\n  - **Total value = 245 + 138 + 64 + 126 + 189 = 762**\n\nSince 762 > 644, this is a valid and better offer for me.\n\n### Decision\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 0, 1, 1]}",

My goal is to \u201csplit\u2010the\u2010pie\u201d so that the offer is just good enough for Player\u00a02 to be tempted to agree rather than risk waiting (especially since discounting lowers the eventual payoff) while still leaving me a good share of the items I value highly. I know my own item\u2010values:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a01 is very precious (78) and it\u2019s the only unit available, so I prefer to keep it.\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Items\u00a04 (66 per unit) and\u00a05 (31 per unit) are also important.\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Items\u00a02 (9 per unit) and\u00a03 (6 per unit) are lower\u2010value for me, so they\u2019re \u201ccheaper\u201d concessions.\nAlso, the full bundle is 13 units. A na\u00efve equal \u201ccount\u2010split\u201d would give about 6\u20137 units each. (Under an average and rough assumption that Player\u00a02\u2019s unit values average around 51, a 50\u201350 split in count would roughly translate into a near\u2013equal deal. But since I\u2019m the first mover I\u2019d like a slight edge\u2014provided that the offer is good enough to beat their outside option, which for them is drawn from 1 up to their total value; their expected disagreement value is on the order of half their full\u2010bundle value.) \n\nBased on that, I want to concede fully on the lower\u2010value items (items\u00a02 and 3) and give up a little of the middle\u2013rated ones (one extra unit each from items that I\u2019m less discriminating about) so that Player\u00a02 ends up with roughly 7 units.

In my own valuation that gives me:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a01: 1\u00d778 = 78\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a04: 4\u00d766 = 264\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a05: 1\u00d731 = 31\n\u2003\u2002Total = 78 + 264 + 31 = 373.\nIf we assume (roughly) that Player\u00a02\u2019s private valuations average around 51 per unit, then their expected value from this offer would be approximately:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a02: 1\u00d751 = 51\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a03: 2\u00d751 = 102\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a04: 2\u00d751 = 102\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a05: 2\u00d751 = 102\n\u2003\u2002Total \u2248 51 + 102 + 102 + 102 = 357.\nThis is close to what they might expect (and given discounting and uncertainty about their outside offer, it should be acceptable) while still leaving me with a better payoff as the proposer.\n\nThus, my chosen action in round 1 is to propose the counteroffer with the division shown below.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 2, 2, 2]}",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 0, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    77 x 1 + 81 x 1 + 1 x 0 + 33 x 1 + 28 x 1\n    which is 219 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 220. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Let's propose:\n\n- Keep 1 unit of Item 1 (77 value to me)\n- Keep 0 units of Item 2\n- Keep 0 units of Item 3\n- Keep 2 units of Item 4 (66 value to me)\n- Keep 1 units of Item 5 (28 value to me)\n\nPropose to give Player 1:\n- 0 unit of Item 1\n- 1 units of Item 2\n- 2 units of Item 3\n- 4 units of Item 4\n- 2 units of Item 5\n\nCalculate my value for the new offer:\n- Item 1: 1 \u00d7 77 = 77\n- Item 2: 0 \u00d7 81 = 0\n- Item 3: 0 \u00d7 1 = 0\n- Item 4: 2 \u00d7 33 = 66\n- Item 5: 1 \u00d7 28 = 28\n- Total value = 77 + 0 + 0 + 66 + 28 = 171\n\nI realize that this total, 171, is less than my outside offer. Let's reassess by keeping another unit of Item 4 to improve my value.\n\nRevised offer:\nKeep:\n- 1 unit of Item 1 (77 value to me)\n- 0 units of Item 2\n- 0 units of Item 3\n- 3 units of Item 4 (99 value to me)\n- 0 units of Item 5\n\nOffer to Player 1:\n- 0 unit of Item 1\n- 1 units of Item 2\n- 2 units of Item 3\n- 3 units of Item 4\n- 3 units of Item 5\n\nRecalculate my value:\n- Item 1: 1 \u00d7 77 = 77\n- Item 2: 0 \u00d7 81 = 0\n- Item 3: 0 \u00d7 1 = 0\n- Item 4: 3 \u00d7 33 = 99\n- Item 5: 0 \u00d7 28 = 0\n- Total value = 77 + 0 + 0 + 99 + 0 = 176\n\nThis still falls short. Let's continue iterating. For now, based on my higher valuation of item 4, keeping even more of it might yield the desired value exceeding 220, but each attempt overshoots. Let's try a balanced split with 5 units of item 4.\n\nOffer to Player 1:\n- 0 unit of Item 1\n- 1 units of Item 2\n- 2 units of Item 3\n- 1 units of Item 4\n- 3 units of Item 5\n\nThus, keeping:\n- 1 unit of Item 1 (77 value to me)\n- 0 units of Item 2\n- 0 units of Item 3\n- 5 units of Item 4 (165 value to me)\n- 0 units of Item 5\n\nRecalculating total:\n- Item 1: 1 \u00d7 77 = 77\n- Item 2: 0 \u00d7 81 = 0\n- Item 3: 0 \u00d7 1 = 0\n- Item 4: 5 \u00d7 33 = 165\n- Item 5: 0 \u00d7 28 = 0\n- Total value = 77 + 0 + 0 + 165 + 0 = 242\n\nThis gives me a total of 242, which is greater than my outside offer value of 220. So, I will propose this as my counteroffer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 2, 1, 3]}",

                    "response": "I first check what accepting the current offer would give me. The total amounts of items are: item1 = 1, item2 = 1, item3 = 2, item4 = 6, and item5 = 3. In the current offer Player\u202f2 is proposing that I receive [0, 1, 2, 1, 3]. (Recall that when an offer is \u201cto you\u201d it means you get exactly that many units on each item; Player\u202f2 gets what remains.) If I accept then my allocation is:\n\u2003\u2022 Item\u202f1: 0 units\n\u2003\u2022 Item\u202f2: 1 unit\n\u2003\u2022 Item\u202f3: 2 units\n\u2003\u2022 Item\u202f4: 1 unit\n\u2003\u2022 Item\u202f5: 3 units\n\nMy private per\u2010unit values are: item1 = 78, item2 = 9, item3 = 6, item4 = 66, item5 = 31. So the raw (undiscounted) value I get is calculated as:\n\u20030\u00d778 + 1\u00d79 + 2\u00d76 + 1\u00d766 + 3\u00d731 = 0 + 9 + 12 + 66 + 93 = 180.\n\nSince we are now in round 2 the outcome is discounted by \u03b3^(r\u20131) = 0.98^(2\u20131) = 0.98. Thus the present value of accepting is 180 \u00d7 0.98 = about 176.4.\n\nI had previously offered [0, 1, 2, 2, 2] in round 1 (which would give me the remainder [1, 0, 0, 4, 1] corresponding to a raw value of 78 + 0 + 0 + 4\u00d766 + 1\u00d731 = 373), but Player\u202f2 rejected that and counter\u2010offered [0, 1, 2, 1, 3]. If I now try a counteroffer I would like to \u201cclaim\u201d some of the high\u2011value items (for me, item1 and item4) but I must also worry that Player\u202f2\u2019s own undisclosed values (and their previous choice) show that he cares about items (for example he already \u201csecured\u201d almost the full item1 and a lot of item4 by his offer). Pushing too hard (e.g. not giving him 1 unit of item1 so he can end up with his expected share) risk that he will reject my counteroffer. With only one round left after this the potential for further concessions is small and the extra discount in a later round will reduce my overall payoff.\n\nThus, although I would like to get more than 176.4 (discounted) points relative to my private value, the risk that a counteroffer is rejected and the negotiation goes to delay (or even break down, leaving me with my outside option of 6) is not worth it given that 176.4 is very good compared to 6. \n\nBecause the current offer reliably gives me a payoff far above my outside option and trying to recapture the division I would have liked from my initial offer might cause Player\u202f2 to walk away (or force further rounds with discounting), the prudent choice in round 2 is to accept the current offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 2, 2, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    90 x 0 + 80 x 0 + 72 x 2 + 87 x 2 + 33 x 1\n    which is 351 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 353. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

I know my own per\u2013unit values:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 58 (5 units)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 40 (2 units)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 37 (3 units)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 20 (3 units)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 40 (6 units)\n\u2003\u2003Total = 781.\n3. I want to propose an offer on round 1 (with no discounting this round) that gives Player 2 just enough expected value compared to their outside offer (drawn uniformly on [1, their total value]). Although I do not know Player 2\u2019s exact values, the expected per\u2013unit value for them is roughly the midpoint of 1 and 101, about 51. Their total value if they got everything is about 969 (summing 5\u00d751, 2\u00d751, etc.), so their expected reservation might be roughly 969/2 \u2248 485.\n4. My idea is to \u201cbuy\u201d as much value as possible by keeping the items where I have the highest edge over the (expected) opponent\u2019s value. Comparing my values to the estimated average (51):\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 58 \u2013 advantageous (+7 per unit) \u2192 I want to keep these.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Items with lower relative value to me (and even disadvantageous compared to the average) can be conceded. In particular, Item 4 (value 20 vs ~51) is attractive to give away.\n5. Thus, an offer that gives Player 2 most of the lower\u2013valued items while I keep all of item 1 seems promising. For instance, I can propose:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Give Player 2 all of item 2 (2 units) and item 3 (3 units) and all of item 4 (3 units), and then some of item 5.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 The expected \u201cmarket\u201d value for these:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 2\u00d751 = 102\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 3\u00d751 = 153\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 3\u00d751 = 153\n\u2003\u2003Total so far: 102 + 153 + 153 = 408.\n6. To hit roughly the 485 threshold, I can give some of item 5. Allocating 2 units of item 5 gives an extra \u2248 2\u00d751 = 102 expected value, bringing Player 2\u2019s total to 408 + 102 = 510, which should be acceptable.\n7. In this proposal, I keep:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 All 5 units of item 1 (value: 5\u00d758 = 290)\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 The remaining 4 units of item 5 (value: 4\u00d740 = 160)\n\u2003\u2003Total for me: 290 + 160 = 450, which is well above my outside value and leaves good surplus.\n8. Thus the offer I will make is to give Player 2:\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 0 units,\n\u2003\u2003Item 2: 2 units,\n\u2003\u2003Item 3: 3 units,\n\u2003\u2003Item 4: 3 units,\n\u2003\u2003Item 5: 2 units.\nThis division is valid given the available quantities and meets both sides\u2019 likely thresholds while letting me keep the high\u2013valued items.\n\nFinal action:\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 3, 3, 2]}",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    60 x 0 + 53 x 0 + 24 x 1 + 100 x 1 + 30 x 3\n    which is 214 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 215. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "I'll explain my thought process.\n\nStep 1. I first computed my total value for all items:\n\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 8 units \u00d7 27 = 216  \n\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 3 units \u00d7 11 = 33  \n\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 5 units \u00d7 36 = 180  \n\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 1 unit \u00d7 6 = 6  \n\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 3 units \u00d7 12 = 36  \nTotal = 471.\nMy outside offer is 192, so any deal I agree to must give me a payoff above 192 (remember that in round 1 there is no discount yet).\n\nStep 2. I then noted that Player 2\u2019s value-per-unit is unknown, but it is drawn uniformly from 1 to 101. On average the per\u2010unit value is about (1+101)/2 = 51. Thus, if we look at the total quantities of items (which sum to 8+3+5+1+3 = 20 units), the \u201cexpected total value\u201d for Player 2 is roughly 20\u00d751 = 1020. Splitting this evenly (in expectation) means about 510 for each player. Since each \u201cunit\u201d (by expectation) is 51 value, Player 2 would expect to get roughly 10 units worth of \u201cvalue\u201d (10\u00d751 = 510).\n\nStep 3. My goal is to propose an allocation that leaves me with a high return (well above my 192 reservation) while giving Player 2 roughly the 10 units that would sum (in an average sense) to 510. I also note that I have my own bias: I value items differently. My high\u2010value items are item 3 (36) and item 1 (27), while items 2 (11), 4 (6) and 5 (12) are \u201ccheaper\u201d for me. To keep my own utility high I\u2019d like to keep all of my item 3 and most of item 1.\n\nStep 4. In order to get Player 2 approximately 10 \u201cunits\u201d worth of expected value, I can give them all of items 2, 4, and 5. These sum to 3 + 1 + 3 = 7 units. I still need to \u201callocate\u201d three more units from the remaining items. Between item 1 (27 per unit for me) and item 3 (36 per unit for me), it costs me less to give away one unit of item 1. Hence, I propose giving away 3 units of item 1.\n\nStep 5. Thus, my offer is:\n\u2003\u2022 Give Player 2: 3 units of item 1, all 3 of item 2, 0 of item 3, the 1 unit of item 4, and all 3 of item 5. That totals 3+3+0+1+3 = 10 \u201cunits,\u201d roughly valued at 510 in expectation for Player 2.\n\u2003\u2022 I keep: 8\u20133 = 5 units of item 1 and all 5 units of item 3. My payoff then is 5\u00d727 + 5\u00d736 = 135 + 180 = 315, which is well above my outside offer.\n\nStep 6. This is a Pareto\u2013efficient offer which gives a fair \u201c50\u201350\u201d split from an expected perspective for Player 2 while allowing me to secure a good value.\n\nThus, my action in round 1 is to propose the counteroffer giving Player 2 the items: [3, 3, 0, 1, 3].\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 3, 0, 1, 3]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 334. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1011 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    100 x 0 + 37 x 0 + 57 x 1 + 77 x 1 + 66 x 3\n    which is 332 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 334. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 3, 0, 1, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 3, 0, 1, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "I'll explain my reasoning.\n\nI first note that if I got everything I\u2019d have a total (subjective) value of\n\u2003\u20035\u00d779 + 4\u00d749 + 2\u00d732 + 7\u00d716 + 3\u00d781 = 1010.\nMy private outside option is 622, so any negotiated division must give me more than 622 (when discounted; here round\u20101 discount is 1).\n\nBecause my per\u2010unit values vary a lot, I want to \u201ckeep\u201d the items I value highly and \u201coffer\u201d away the ones I value relatively little. In my case the highest\u2010valued items are item\u00a01 (79 per unit) and item\u00a05 (81 per unit). My lower\u2010valued items are item\u00a02 (49), item\u00a03 (32) and especially item\u00a04 (16). (I note that even though item\u00a02 is middling for me, if I give player\u00a02 too little total quantity they could compare the deal with their outside option; given that their (unknown) values are drawn from Uniform(1,101) the expected \u201cprice\u201d per unit is roughly 51. In other words, player\u00a02 is likely to expect a \u201cfair\u201d split to give them roughly half of their potential total. Their expected total is roughly 21\u00d751 = 1071 so an outside option in expectation is about 1071/2 \u2248 535.)\n\nA natural idea is to allocate to myself item\u00a01 and item\u00a05\u2014\n\u2003\u2003Item\u00a01: all 5 units (value 5\u00d779 = 395)\n\u2003\u2003Item\u00a05: all 3 units (value 3\u00d781 = 243)\nwhich sums to 638 for me. This exceeds 622 (the outside option) by a small margin but is still better than my guaranteed offer.\n\nThen I propose to give player\u00a02 all of the remaining items:\n\u2003\u2003Item\u00a02: all 4 units\n\u2003\u2003Item\u00a03: all 2 units\n\u2003\u2003Item\u00a04: all 7 units\n\nIf we add these up, player\u00a02 would receive 4+2+7 = 13 units. Although I don\u2019t know their exact values, given their values are drawn uniformly from 1 to 101 the expected per\u2010unit value is about 51. That would yield an expected total of roughly 13\u00d751 = 663 to player\u00a02. This is likely enough to create an incentive for them to accept compared with the uncertain outside option (which by expectation is around 535).\n\nThus, this division is \u201calmost fair\u201d in terms of expected total value for player\u00a02 while ensuring that I get 638\u2014which is safely above my outside offer of 622. (I am giving up the items I value less \u2013 items\u00a02, 3 and especially 4 \u2013 to appease player\u00a02.)\n\nSo my initial counteroffer, stating how many units I give to player\u00a02 (and I keep the remainder), is:\n\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 0 (I keep all 5 units)\n\u2003\u2003Item 2: 4 (all given away)\n\u2003\u2003Item 3: 2 (all given away)\n\u2003\u2003Item 4: 7 (all given away)\n\u2003\u2003Item 5: 0 (I keep all 3 units)\n\nUsing the required response format, here is my action:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 4, 2, 7, 0]}",

                    "response": "I\u2019ll explain my thinking briefly. (Note: Because player\u202f2\u2019s true per\u2010unit values and outside offer are hidden and drawn randomly, one must \u201chedge\u201d by offering enough to tempt them\u2014but without overshooting so much that my own guaranteed payoff (1055 via my outside offer) is sacrificed. In my calculation my own full\u2010value total (if I got all items) is 1357. If no deal is reached I get 1055, so any deal I propose must give me more than 1055 in my own value terms. At the same time, player\u202f2 will compare the value of what I offer them (based on their own private values) to the outside offer they would get if negotiations break down. Although I cannot know player\u202f2\u2019s draw, if I assume that on average each unit is worth roughly 51 to them (the midpoint of 1 to 101) then a \u201ctypical\u201d outside offer would be roughly half of their total (and \u2013 if their total is similar to the common total value of about 816 \u2013 around 408). Thus, in order to entice player\u202f2 to accept in round\u202f1 rather than wait for their outside offer, I must \u201cpay\u201d them enough items so that, in expectation, they get roughly 400 or more \u201cunits\u2010of\u2010value.\u201d However, if I concede too many items then my own share would fall below my disagreement level. (In fact, if I were to \u201cbuy\u201d an 8\u2013unit bundle of items\u2014as chosen by my ranking of items from least to most valuable\u2014to yield roughly 8\u00d751 \u2248 408 to player\u202f2, that bundle would cost me roughly 600+ (using my own values) and leave me with only around 746, which is much less than my outside offer of 1055.) \n\nSo there is a tension: claiming nearly all of the \u201cpie\u201d (all items except a minimal bundle) would leave player\u202f2 with only a bundle that by my count is worth roughly 263 (for example, giving away item\u202f1\u2019s 2 units [2\u00d753 = 106] plus item\u202f2\u2019s 1 unit [69] plus one unit of item\u202f3 [88] gives 106+69+88 = 263). Such a bundle\u2014being only 4 items\u2014is quite meager by the rough \u201caverage\u2010unit\u201d estimate (roughly 4\u00d751 \u2248 204), and player\u202f2 may well reject it if their private draw makes them \u201cworth\u201d more than that. However, if I were to \u201cbuy\u201d a bundle sufficient to clear player\u202f2\u2019s outside offer (say roughly 8 units) then my allocated share would drop to about 746, well below my safe outside value.\n\nThus, using my own information I conclude that any deal that would leave me with more than 1055 (my safe outside payoff) must \u201ccost\u201d me less than 1357\u20131055 = 302 (in my own dollar\u2010equivalents). The cheapest bundle I can \u201cbuy\u201d (by my ordering of items from least to most valuable\u2014item\u202f1 is 53, item\u202f2 is 69, then item\u202f3 at 88, then item\u202f5 at 87, then item\u202f4 at 94) that has size at least 1 unit is obtained by giving player\u202f2 both units of item\u202f1 (cost = 106), the single unit of item\u202f2 (69), and one unit of item\u202f3 (88), for a total \u201ccost\u201d of 106 + 69 + 88 = 263. That leaves me with the remaining items: 1 unit of item\u202f3, all 7 units of item\u202f4, and all 4 units of item\u202f5. My total value then is 1357 \u2013 263 = 1094, which beats my outside offer of 1055. (Any attempt to \u201cpay\u201d enough to meet a typical 8\u2013unit threshold would force me below 1055.)\n\nWithout knowing player\u202f2\u2019s private numbers I must hope that they might be \u201cbelow average\u201d in their draw so that a bundle that I value at 263 (or, in expectation, around 200 using average unit values) might be acceptable to them. In equilibrium, if player\u202f2\u2019s realization is high then they likely reject and I\u2019ll safely get my 1055 by walking away. \n\nAs my first move I therefore propose the allocation whereby I offer player\u202f2 the following bundle:\n\u2003\u2022 item 1: 2 units \n\u2003\u2022 item 2: 1 unit \n\u2003\u2022 item 3: 1 unit \n\u2003\u2022 item 4: 0 units \n\u2003\u2022 item 5: 0 units\n\nThis is expressed in the required format as follows:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 1, 0, 0]}",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 1, 3, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    83 x 1 + 18 x 1 + 47 x 1 + 13 x 3 + 88 x 4\n    which is 539 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 540. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 1, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 1, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

The earlier I accept an offer that is beneficial, the higher my effective value will be.\n\n### 2) Assess the value of offers:\n\n- **Current Offer**: I am being offered [2, 1, 1, 0, 0].\n  - Calculating my total value for the current offer:\n    - 2 units of item 1 = \\(2 \\times 83 = 166\\)\n    - 1 unit of item 2 = \\(1 \\times 18 = 18\\)\n    - 1 unit of item 3 = \\(1 \\times 47 = 47\\)\n    - 0 units of item 4 = \\(0 \\times 13 = 0\\)\n    - 0 units of item 5 = \\(0 \\times 88 = 0\\)\n  - Total value = \\(166 + 18 + 47 + 0 + 0 = 231\\)\n\n- **Comparison**:\n  - The current offer gives me a value of 231, which is considerably lower than my outside offer of 540.\n\n### 3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n\n- Since the current offer (231) is much worse than my outside offer (540), I cannot accept it.\n- Walking away does not make sense yet because I should attempt a counteroffer first.\n- I need to propose a counteroffer that yields a value greater than 540 for me.\n\n#### Developing a Counteroffer:\nI must keep a combination of items that, when summed with my values, exceeds 540. Given the nature of my preferences and the available items, I aim to maximize my value while offering Player 1 the minimum possible that still provides them with value. Given that I need to keep as much of item 5 as possible due to its high value, and balance with other units:\n\nA potential counteroffer where I might keep [1, 0, 1, 1, 4] units (hence offering Player 1 [1, 1, 1, 6, 0]) would yield:\n\n- 1 unit of item 1 = \\(1 \\times 83 = 83\\)\n- 0 units of item 2 = \\(0 \\times 18 = 0\\)\n- 1 unit of item 3 = \\(1 \\times 47 = 47\\)\n- 1 unit of item 4 = \\(1 \\times 13 = 13\\)\n- 4 units of item 5 = \\(4 \\times 88 = 352\\)\n- Total value = \\(83 + 0 + 47 + 13 + 352 = 495\\)\n\nSince this is still less than my outside value of 540, this approach is not suitable. I must refine further to achieve values over my outside offer.\n\nLet's keep [1, 0, 1, 1,3] and thus I would offer Player 1 [1, 1, 1, 6, 1]:\n\n- 1 unit of item 1 = \\(1 \\times 83 = 83\\)\n- 0 units of item 2 = \\(0 \\times 18 = 0\\)\n- 1 unit of item 3 = \\(1 \\times 47 = 47\\)\n- 1 unit of item 4 = \\(1 \\times 13 = 13\\)\n- 3 units of item 5 = \\(3 \\times 88 = 264\\)\n- Total value = \\(83 + 0 + 47 + 13 + 264 = 407\\)\n\nSince, despite my efforts, I cannot achieve more than my outside offer value with plausible splits at this first round stage, my plan must be to signal strengths in highly valued items and apply future reviews to achieve rank console. Considering possible rejection, my action plan would be to reassess as strategic, not presumed left unable to format valid further attempt.\n\nGiven the situation, I must take this into account and make my counteroffer to better signal thresholding strength.\nEnsure permissible values understand antacially subsetson viable rowd.

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 540. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 540. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 747 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 1, 3, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    83 x 1 + 18 x 1 + 47 x 1 + 13 x 3 + 88 x 4\n    which is 539 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 540. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 7, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 1, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 1, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "To determine the best action in response to Player 1's current offer, let's follow the step-by-step process outlined:\n\n1) **Analyze the Current Situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 540.\n   - My values per unit for items are:\n     - Item 1: 83\n     - Item 2: 18\n     - Item 3: 47\n     - Item 4: 13\n     - Item 5: 88\n   - The total pool of items is: \n     - Item 1: 2 units\n     - Item 2: 1 unit\n     - Item 3: 2 units\n     - Item 4: 7 units\n     - Item 5: 4 units\n   - The discount factor (\\(\\gamma = 0.98\\)) influences the value of accepting offers later in the rounds. By the end of round 2, the present value is multiplied by \\(0.98^{1} = 0.98\\).\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n   - Current offer from Player 1: [2, 1, 1, 0, 0]\n     - If I accept this offer, I get:\n       - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 83 = 166\n       - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 18 = 18\n       - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 47 = 47\n       - 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 13 = 0\n       - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 88 = 0\n     - Total value = 166 + 18 + 47 = 231\n     - Adjusted for discount = 231 \u00d7 0.98 = 226.38\n   - Compare this with my outside offer value: 540\n\nSince the value of accepting the current offer (226.38) is significantly lower than my outside offer (540), accepting the offer would be a mistake as per the criteria (Mistake 4).\n\n3) **Make a Decision Based on the Analysis:**\n   - Accepting the current offer is not beneficial, as it results in a lower value than my outside offer.\n   - Walking away would secure my outside offer value of 540.\n   - I can propose a counteroffer that gives me more value than accepting the current offer, aiming for at least 540 or above in value.\n\nTo develop a counteroffer, I want to focus on maximizing my value while still staying competitive.\n\nLet's evaluate retaining more high-value items (for me):\n\n- Offer Player 1: [1, 1, 0, 4, 2]\n  - My retained items:\n    - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 83 = 83\n    - 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 18 = 0\n    - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 47 = 94\n    - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39\n    - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 88 = 176\n  - Total value = 83 + 94 + 39 + 176 = 392 \n\nThis value is still lower than my outside offer. I will iterate:\n- Offer Player 1: [0, 0, 0, 7, 2] to maximize value on higher value items\n  - My retained items:\n    - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 83 = 166\n    - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 18 = 18\n    - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 47 = 94\n    - 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 13 = 0\n    - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 88 = 176\n  - Total value = 166 + 18 + 94 + 176 = 454\n\nThis is still less than my outside offer, but closer. However, due to limitation in scenarios with fewer rounds, the optimized counter might need more aggressive division for improvement:\n\n- Offer Player 1: [0, 0, 0, 4, 2]\n  - My retained items:\n    - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 83 = 166\n    - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 18 = 18\n    - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 47 = 94\n    - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39\n    - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 88 = 176\n  - Total value = 166 + 18 + 94 + 39 + 176 = 493\n\nThis choice approaches my needed recorded value but again, trading would lead to less. Hence, based on strategic stand and rounds position:\n\nDue to failing to evaluate a method yielding above 540 without risking Walk in rounds, the prudent choice is:\n\n**{\"action\": \"WALK\"}**",

                    "response": "My reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. We note that there are 20 total item units (6+5+5+1+3). In a \u201cfair\u2010split\u201d if both players had similar values, each might expect roughly 10 units in value. In my case, however, I know my own per\u2010unit values:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item\u00a01: 17\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item\u00a02: 39 \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item\u00a03: 85 \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item\u00a04: 2 \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item\u00a05: 38\n\u2003My \u201cmost precious\u201d items are item\u00a03 (85) and item\u00a05 (38), while item\u00a01 (17) and item\u00a04 (2) I value much less. \n\n2. My disagreement payoff is 378 (my outside offer) so any deal I propose should give me a payoff better than that. If I were to take everything I value highly (item\u00a03 and item\u00a05, along with as much of item\u00a02 as possible) and concede those items I value little (item\u00a01 and item\u00a04) to Player\u00a02, I can \u201cbuy\u201d their acceptance by giving them roughly half of the total units. \n\n3. A natural idea is to offer Player\u00a02 exactly 10 units so that, if their private values were average (roughly a midpoint of the 1\u2013101 range), they\u2019d be roughly at or just above the reservation value from their outside offer. Given that the \u201cexpected\u201d per\u2010unit value for an unknown valuation is about 51, 10 units implies an expected total around 510. This is close to what might be available from the outside offer distribution.\n\n4. To maximize my payoff I wish to keep the high\u2010value items:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 I give away all of item\u00a01 (6 units) since each unit gives me only 17 relative to many possible values for Player\u00a02.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 I also give away item\u00a04 (1 unit) because it is almost valueless to me.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 This already amounts to 7 units (6+1). To reach a total of 10 for Player\u00a02, I need 3 more units from the remaining items.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item\u00a02 (value 39) is moderately good for me, so I can afford to concede 3 units there while keeping 2 for myself.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 I then keep all of item\u00a03 (5 units) and all of item\u00a05 (3 units) because they are my highest\u2010valued items.\n\n5. Under this proposal the division is:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Player\u00a02 receives: item\u00a01:6, item\u00a02:3, item\u00a03:0, item\u00a04:1, item\u00a05:0 (a total of 6+3+0+1+0 = 10 units).\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 I receive: item\u00a01:0, item\u00a02:2, item\u00a03:5, item\u00a04:0, item\u00a05:3. \n\u2003\u2003My overall value is: 0\u00d717 + 2\u00d739 + 5\u00d785 + 0\u00d72 + 3\u00d738 = 78 + 425 + 114 = 617, which is well above my outside offer.\n\n6. This split gives Player\u00a02 an expected \u201cquantity\u201d (if values were near average) worth roughly 10\u00d751 \u2248 510, making it competitive with an outside offer while allowing me to retain the items that give me the most value.\n\nBased on that reasoning, my initial action is to make the following counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [6, 3, 0, 1, 0]}",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 36. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 36. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 615 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 5, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    84 x 0 + 63 x 0 + 3 x 5 + 1 x 1 + 54 x 0\n    which is 16 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 36. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [6, 3, 0, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [6, 3, 0, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "To decide on the appropriate action, let's walk through the analysis step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n- **Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer value is 36.\n- **Values of the Items**:\n  - Item 1: 84 per unit\n  - Item 2: 63 per unit\n  - Item 3: 3 per unit\n  - Item 4: 1 per unit\n  - Item 5: 54 per unit\n- **Total Pool of Items**: \n  - Item 1: 6 units\n  - Item 2: 5 units\n  - Item 3: 5 units\n  - Item 4: 1 unit\n  - Item 5: 3 units\n- **Discount Factor Influence**: Since this is round 1, there's no discount applied yet. The value of accepting the current offer is its immediate face value.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n- **Current Offer Value**:\n  - 6 units of item 1: 6 \u00d7 84 = 504\n  - 3 units of item 2: 3 \u00d7 63 = 189\n  - 0 units of item 3: 0 \u00d7 3 = 0\n  - 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 1 = 1\n  - 0 units of item 5: 0 \u00d7 54 = 0\n  - **Total value if I accept offer = 694**\n\n- **Compare to Outside Offer**: \n  - Current offer value = 694\n  - Outside offer value = 36\n  - The current offer is significantly better than my outside offer.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\nMistakes to avoid include:\n- **Mistake 4**: Don't accept an offer worse than the outside offer.\n- **Mistake 5**: Don't walk away from an offer better than the outside offer.\n\nIn this round, accepting the current offer gives me a value of 694, while walking away would only provide a value of 36. Thus, accepting is the optimal choice, as it is substantially greater than my outside offer.\n\nTherefore, the logical action is to ACCEPT the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

My goal in round\u00a01 is to propose an offer that \u201canchors\u201d the negotiation in my favor while giving Player\u00a02 just enough on the table so that \u2013 when they compare what they\u2019d get from accepting this deal (with no discount) versus what they might expect by rejecting and walking or counter\u2010offering in later rounds (with discounting) \u2013 they will be inclined to agree. I know my own values:\n\u2022\u2003Item\u00a01: 70 per unit (5 available)\n\u2022\u2003Item\u00a02: 25 per unit (1 available)\n\u2022\u2003Item\u00a03: 62 per unit (0 available)\n\u2022\u2003Item\u00a04: 90 per unit (1 available)\n\u2022\u2003Item\u00a05: 4 per unit (4 available)\n\nI also know my outside offer is very low (13); combined with the discount factor (\u03b3 = 0.98) that makes future rounds less desirable, this means I can \u201cclaim\u201d almost all of the high\u2010value items while offering Player\u00a02 mainly the items I care less about.\n\nSince item\u00a01 and item\u00a04 are where my value is highest, I want to keep almost all of them (I leave them with 4 out of 5 of item\u00a01 and all of item\u00a04). On the other hand, although item\u00a02 is modest for me (25 each) it may have average value for Player\u00a02 (their unit value is drawn from 1\u2013101, roughly an average of 51) so giving them its single unit is a \u201ccheap\u201d way of boosting their effective deal. Likewise, I don\u2019t get much value from item\u00a05 (only 4 per unit) so I offer them all 4 units. (Item\u00a03 has 0 available.)\n\nThus, I offer Player\u00a02 the following:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a01: 1 unit (so I keep 4, and gain 4 \u00d7 70 = 280)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a02: 1 unit (I give away the only unit; cost to me is 25, but it is \u201ccheap\u201d relative to the possible average value for them)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a03: 0 units (none available)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a04: 0 units (I keep the only unit worth 90 to me)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a05: 4 units (I give all away; at 4 per unit, they are low\u2010value for me)\n\nMy overall allocation gives me 280 + 90 + 25\u00d70 + 0 + 0 = 370 in my private value, while Player\u00a02 gets what we expect might be around a combined value (using their typical averages) of roughly 1 unit of item\u00a01 (~51), plus 1 unit of item\u00a02 (~51) plus 4 units of item\u00a05 (~204) \u2013 amounting to an expected overall value of roughly 306. In round\u00a01 (undiscounted) this deal is attractive for Player\u00a02 relative to what they might expect (especially given the discounting if negotiations drag on). \n\nBased on this reasoning my initial action is to propose this offer as my counteroffer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 0, 4]}",

                    "response": "Step\u2010by\u2010step reasoning:\n\n1. We check our current offer. The current offer on the table (from Player 2) gives us:\n\u2003\u2022 2 units of item\u202f1 (value = 2\u00d770 = 140)\n\u2003\u2022 0 units of item\u202f2\n\u2003\u2022 0 units of item\u202f3\n\u2003\u2022 0 units of item\u202f4\n\u2003\u2022 2 units of item\u202f5 (value = 2\u00d74 = 8)\n\u2003Total raw value = 140 + 8 = 148.\n\u2003Because this is round 2 and the discount factor is \u03b3 = 0.98 per round beyond round 1, our realized value if we finish this round is 148\u00d70.98 \u2248 145.04.\n\n2. Our outside option is 13 \u2013 far below the current offer\u2019s present value. So \u201cWALK\u201d is unattractive.\n\n3. Although we could try a counteroffer to shift the division in our favor (especially because we value certain items very highly, e.g. item\u202f1 and especially item\u202f4), any counteroffer must be acceptable to Player\u202f2. Looking at the history:\n\u2003\u2013 In round 1 we offered [1, 1, 0, 0, 4] (giving us a good share of our \u201cgood\u2010quality\u201d items).\n\u2003\u2013 Player\u202f2\u2019s round\u20111 offer gave us [2, 0, 0, 0, 2] (so they would get the remaining items, which includes the unit of item\u202f4 they would like to keep if we don\u2019t claim it).\n\u2003If we try to keep item\u202f4 for ourselves in a counteroffer, we must \u201csteal\u201d that unit from Player\u202f2\u2019s bundle. To keep them willing to agree, we would have to compensate them elsewhere. Although it is tempting \u2013 since our own private value for item\u202f4 is 90 (even higher than our 70 for item\u202f1) \u2013 Player\u202f2 already expects to get 1 unit of item\u202f4 in their own offer. A counteroffer that removes their item\u202f4 would force us to \u201cpay\u201d for that by ceding extra units in other categories. For example, one might try to give them extra of item\u202f1 or item\u202f5. However, given that we face uncertainty about Player\u202f2\u2019s private values (drawn uniformly on 1 to 101) and knowing that we improved from our earlier proposal, any attempt to \u201csteal\u201d item\u202f4 is risky: if Player\u202f2 rejects our counteroffer then we have to move to round 3 (with even more discounting) or even risk losing the deal.\n\n4. In contrast, the current offer already gives us a very respectable near\u2010term value (\u2248145 discounted) compared to our outside option (13) and with only one round left, the room to compensate if negotiations fall apart is very small.\n\n5. Hence, to avoid the risk of a breakdown (or ending up in a more heavily discounted round) our best and safest move is to ACCEPT the current offer.\n\nThus, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

I know that if I got everything I\u2019d have a value of 397 and my private outside option is 184. (So any agreement that gives me more than 184 in discounted value is better than walking away.) My items\u2019 values to me are very uneven. In my evaluation item 1 (76 per unit), item 4 (45), and item 5 (44) are very \u201cprecious,\u201d while item 2 (11) and item 3 (12) are \u201ccheaper\u201d for me. (Also note that the totals are: 2 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 1 of item 4, 3 of item 5 \u2013 so there is little to no leeway: every unit must be allocated.) \n\nAlthough I lack knowledge of Player 2\u2019s actual private values, I know each of their values is drawn uniformly from 1 to 101 so their \u201ctypical\u201d (average) value per unit is around 51. This suggests that\u2014even if Player 2 would favor some items more or less\u2014the items that I don\u2019t mind giving away (namely item 2 and item 3) in my eyes will likely look acceptable to them. \n\nWith that in mind, I decide to offer Player 2 all of item 2 (all 4 units) and all of item 3 (both units) in the very first round. This leaves me with both units of item 1, the single unit of item 4, and all 3 units of item 5. My value from those would be: \n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 1: 2 \u00d7 76 = 152  \n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 4: 1 \u00d7 45 = 45  \n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 5: 3 \u00d7 44 = 132  \nFor a total subjective value of 152 + 45 + 132 = 329, which is well above my outside option. \n\nI expect that Player 2, whose unknown but likely \u201caverage\u201d per\u2010unit values make item 2 and item 3 worth roughly 4\u00d751 + 2\u00d751 \u2248 204 + 102 \u2248 306 in expectation, will find this offer attractive relative to the risk of delay (discounting) and the uncertainty of their own outside option. In this spirit, my first offer is to \u201cgive\u201d Player 2 all of item 2 and 3, keeping my \u201cprecious\u201d items for myself.\n\nThus, the offer I propose is to assign to Player 2:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 1: 0  \n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 2: 4  \n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 3: 2  \n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 4: 0  \n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 5: 0  \n\nThis proposal is made as a counteroffer at Round 1. \n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 4, 2, 0, 0]}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    98 x 0 + 46 x 0 + 36 x 0 + 61 x 0 + 16 x 3\n    which is 48 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 52. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n1. We have a total \u201cpie\u201d of items: 7 units of item\u202f1, 4 units of item\u202f2, 2 units of item\u202f3, 4 units of item\u202f4, and 4 units of item\u202f5.\n2. My private per\u2010unit values are [21, 58, 63, 88, 77] for items 1 through 5 respectively, so the full \u201ccake\u201d is worth 1165 to me. I also have an outside option of 387.\n3. As Player\u202f1 in round\u202f1 (with no discount yet), I want to propose an offer to Player\u202f2 that (a) gives them enough so that they should (in expectation, given their unknown values and outside offer) prefer accepting over risking later rounds, yet (b) allows me to claim a favorable share of the surplus.\n4. I note that item\u202f1 is \u201ccheap\u201d for me (only 21/unit) so I am willing to give it entirely to Player\u202f2. Some items (especially items 4 and 5, at 88 and 77/unit) are very valuable to me so I try to keep most of those.\n5. A plausible initial offer is to give Player\u202f2 all 7 units of item\u202f1 (which I value at 21 each), almost all of item\u202f2, and a little bit of the high\u2010value items so that they see some \u201chigh\u2010quality\u201d content in the deal. For example, if I offer Player\u202f2: 7 units of item\u202f1, 3 units of item\u202f2, 0 units of item\u202f3, 1 unit of item\u202f4, and 1 unit of item\u202f5, then Player\u202f2\u2019s allocation would be [7, 3, 0, 1, 1] and I would get the remaining items, that is [0, 1, 2, 3, 3].\n6. My allocation by this offer is:\n\u2003\u2022 item\u202f1: 0 units\u2003\u2003\u2003(0\u00d721 = 0)\n\u2003\u2022 item\u202f2: 1 unit\u2003\u2003\u2003(1\u00d758 = 58)\n\u2003\u2022 item\u202f3: 2 units\u2003\u2003\u2003(2\u00d763 = 126)\n\u2003\u2022 item\u202f4: 3 units\u2003\u2003\u2003(3\u00d788 = 264)\n\u2003\u2022 item\u202f5: 3 units\u2003\u2003\u2003(3\u00d777 = 231)\n\u2003Total value = 58 + 126 + 264 + 231 = 679.\n7. This 679 is well above my outside option of 387, and while I have \u201csqueezed\u201d a lot from my high\u2010value items, the offer gives Player\u202f2 a complete bundle of item\u202f1 plus some of item\u202f2 and a touch from items 4 and 5. Although I do not know their private values, offering some \u201cpremium\u201d items should help meet any reservation values they might have relative to their (unknown) outside option.\n8.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 386. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 429 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 1, 2, 4, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    19 x 3 + 10 x 1 + 62 x 2 + 38 x 4 + 14 x 3\n    which is 385 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 386. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [7, 3, 0, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [7, 3, 0, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To determine the appropriate action, let's analyze the current situation step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the current situation\n\n- **Outside offer value**: 386\n- **Values of the items to Player 2 (my values)**:\n  - Item 1: 19\n  - Item 2: 10\n  - Item 3: 62\n  - Item 4: 38\n  - Item 5: 14\n\n- **Total pool of items**: \n  - 7 units of item 1\n  - 4 units of item 2\n  - 2 units of item 3\n  - 4 units of item 4\n  - 4 units of item 5\n\n- **Discount factor influence**: The discount factor (gamma = 0.98) slightly reduces the present value of future deals. In the first round, the discount factor doesn't apply since it's raised to the power of (r-1) where r = 1.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the value of offers\n\n- **Current offer**: Player 1 offered [7, 3, 0, 1, 1], which means I would receive:\n  - 7 units of item 1\n  - 3 units of item 2\n  - 0 units of item 3\n  - 1 unit of item 4\n  - 1 unit of item 5\n\n- **Calculate the total value of the current offer to me**:\n  - Item 1: 7 \u00d7 19 = 133\n  - Item 2: 3 \u00d7 10 = 30\n  - Item 3: 0 \u00d7 62 = 0\n  - Item 4: 1 \u00d7 38 = 38\n  - Item 5: 1 \u00d7 14 = 14\n  - **Total value**: 133 + 30 + 0 + 38 + 14 = 215\n\n- **Comparison to outside offer**: The current offer value (215) is less than my outside offer value (386).\n\n### Step 3: Make a decision\n\nAccording to the analysis, the current offer provides a total value of 215, which is significantly less than my outside offer of 386. Therefore, accepting this offer would be a mistake as per Mistake 4 (Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer).\n\nGiven this situation, I should consider making a counteroffer that provides me more value than my outside offer. Let's consider a scenario that keeps more of the valuable items for myself, particularly item 3 which has the highest value per unit for me.\n\nLet\u2019s consider offering a proposal that retains higher-value items for me:\n\n- **Counteroffer proposal**: What I would give Player 1: [2, 3, 1, 0, 2]\n  - Which means: I keep 5 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5\n  - Value of items to me:\n    - Item 1: 5 \u00d7 19 = 95\n    - Item 2: 1 \u00d7 10 = 10\n    - Item 3: 1 \u00d7 62 = 62\n    - Item 4: 4 \u00d7 38 = 152\n    - Item 5: 2 \u00d7 14 = 28\n    - **Total value**: 95 + 10 + 62 + 152 + 28 = 347\n\nThe potential value of this counteroffer (347) is still slightly less than my outside offer (386), so it doesn't meet my objective. Let's continue to find a better offer without relinquishing too much of item 3 and item 4:\n\nAdjusting again:\n\n- **Refined Counteroffer proposal**: [2, 4, 0, 0, 4]\n  - I keep 5 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5\n  - Value of items to me:\n    - Item 1: 5 \u00d7 19 = 95\n    - Item 2: 0 \u00d7 10 = 0\n    - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 62 = 124\n    - Item 4: 4 \u00d7 38 = 152\n    - Item 5: 0 \u00d7 14 = 0\n    - **Total value**: 95 + 0 + 124 + 152 + 0 = 371\n\nThe refined counteroffer value (371) is still below the outside offer, but getting much closer. We should further optimize by proposing a division that maximizes the two most valuable items (3 and 4), while perhaps conceding less relevant items in larger quantities.\n\n- **Optimized Counteroffer proposal**: [2, 3, 0, 0, 3]\n  - I keep 5 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 4 of item 4, 1 of item 5\n  - Value of items to me:\n    - Item 1: 5 \u00d7 19 = 95\n    - Item 2: 1 \u00d7 10 = 10\n    - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 62 = 124\n    - Item 4: 4 \u00d7 38 = 152\n    - Item 5: 1 \u00d7 14 = 14\n    - **Total value**: 95 + 10 + 124 + 152 + 14 = 395\n\nThis optimized counteroffer (395) is now better than my guaranteed fallback of 386.

Your private per\u2010unit values are:\n\u2003\u2003item1: 21,\n\u2003\u2003item2: 58,\n\u2003\u2003item3: 63,\n\u2003\u2003item4: 88,\n\u2003\u2003item5: 77.\n\u2003Thus, under the current offer your \u201cundiscounted\u201d total value would be:\n\u2003\u20032\u00d721 + 3\u00d758 + 0\u00d763 + 0\u00d788 + 3\u00d777 = 42 + 174 + 0 + 0 + 231 = 447.\n\n3. Because this is round 2 and the discount factor is gamma = 0.98 (applied as gamma^(r\u20131)), if you finalize a deal now the outcome is multiplied by 0.98^1 = 0.98. So your discounted value is about 447\u00d70.98 \u2248 438.\n\n4. Your outside offer is 387. Therefore, the current offer gives you a deal whose discounted value of about 438 is significantly higher than what you get upon walking away.\n\n5. Although you could try a counteroffer to try to reassign some items (for instance, trying to get some of the high\u2010value item4 for yourself), any counteroffer risks prolonging the negotiation. If Player 2 rejects, the deal may occur in round 3 with an extra discount and more uncertainty. Given that your current offer already improves on your outside option, and that a counteroffer might jeopardize a sure discounted gain of about 438, the safest and best action is to ACCEPT.\n\nThus, my action is:\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

                    "response": "We need to decide on an initial offer that \u201cuses up\u201d as little of our own item\u2010value as possible but still provides the other side with a bundle that is (hopefully) attractive compared to what they might get if they \u201cwalk\u201d (i.e. their outside offer). (Remember: if no agreement is reached we both \u201cwalk\u201d and get our respective outside offers. I know mine is 1182 in value; since I value everything at 1311 if I got it all, I must \u201csacrifice\u201d no more than 1311 \u2013 1182 = 129 points of my own value if I wish to beat my safe alternative.) \n\nMy own private per\u2013unit values are:\n\u2003 \u2022 item1: 84\u2003 (total units 2 \u2192 168 max)\n\u2003 \u2022 item2: 63\u2003 (6 units \u2192 378)\n\u2003 \u2022 item3: 94\u2003 (5 units \u2192 470)\n\u2003 \u2022 item4: 2\u2003  (2 units \u2192 4)\n\u2003 \u2022 item5: 97\u2003 (3 units \u2192 291)\n\u2003Total: 1311.\n \nThus, if I end up with a bundle worth less than 1182 (discounted by \u03b3^(r\u20131) =1 in round 1) I\u2019d rather \u201cwalk away.\u201d So I must \u201ckeep\u201d at least 1182 of my own value. In other words, I may delegate to Player 2 no more than 1311 \u2013 1182 = 129 \u201cpoints\u201d (from my perspective).\n\nBecause I want the other side to \u201clike\u201d the offer, I try to grant them items for which my own value is very low while\u2014if they are lucky\u2014their private values are high. Looking at my numbers, the \u201ccheapest\u201d item for me is item4 (2 per unit) but there are only 2 units available (total cost 2\u00d72 = 4). Next, among the remaining items the \u201ccheaper\u201d in my scale is item2 (63 per unit). For example, if I hand over 2 units of item2 the cost to me is 2\u00d763 = 126. Then if I combine that with giving them 1 unit of item4 (cost 2) the total \u201csacrifice\u201d is 126 + 2 = 128, which is just under our maximum 129. (In a complete division the offer is expressed as a vector giving the number of units the other player would receive on each item; what I would keep is simply the remainder.) \n\nUnder this candidate offer the allocation is:\n\u2003 \u2022 I give Player 2:\n\u2003\u2003 \u2013 item1: 0 units \n\u2003\u2003 \u2013 item2: 2 units \n\u2003\u2003 \u2013 item3: 0 units \n\u2003\u2003 \u2013 item4: 1 unit \n\u2003\u2003 \u2013 item5: 0 units \n\u2003 \u2022 I keep:\n\u2003\u2003 \u2013 item1: all 2 (worth 2\u00d784 = 168)\n\u2003\u2003 \u2013 item2: the remaining 4 (4\u00d763 = 252)\n\u2003\u2003 \u2013 item3: all 5 (5\u00d794 = 470)\n\u2003\u2003 \u2013 item4: the remaining 1 (1\u00d72 = 2)\n\u2003\u2003 \u2013 item5: all 3 (3\u00d797 = 291)\nThe sum for me is 168 + 252 + 470 + 2 + 291 = 1183 \u2013 a hair above my outside offer of 1182. \n\nFrom my perspective it is \u201cefficient\u201d in that I sacrifice 128 \u201cpoints\u201d (128 = 2\u00d763 + 1\u00d72) of value while keeping nearly everything else. (Of course Player 2\u2019s private values could be quite different; if\u2014for example\u2014they happen to prize item2 or item4 much higher than I do, then the bundle I pass over may be very attractive to them relative to their own outside offer.) \n\nThus, on balance our initial offer in round 1 is to propose that Player 2 gets 0 units of item1, 2 of item2, 0 of item3, 1 of item4, and 0 of item5. \n\nMy action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 0, 1, 0]}",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    9 x 0 + 19 x 0 + 64 x 0 + 24 x 1 + 53 x 0\n    which is 24 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 27. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 0, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 0, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To make a decision, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 27. \n   - My values per unit for the items are:\n     - Item 1: 9\n     - Item 2: 19\n     - Item 3: 64\n     - Item 4: 24\n     - Item 5: 53\n   - The total pool of items consists of 2 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor gamma is 0.98, which means the value of an agreement decreases by 2% each round if an agreement isn't reached.\n\n2) Assess the value of the current offer:\n   - The current offer is [0, 2, 0, 1, 0], which means I receive:\n     - 0 units of item 1 valued at 0 \n     - 2 units of item 2 valued at 2 \u00d7 19 = 38\n     - 0 units of item 3 valued at 0\n     - 1 unit of item 4 valued at 24\n     - 0 units of item 5 valued at 0\n   - Total value of current offer = 38 + 24 = 62\n\n   Compare this against my outside offer value of 27, the current offer is significantly better.\n\n3) Decision making:\n   - Accepting the current offer gives me a value of 62, which is clearly greater than my outside offer of 27.\n   - Mistakes to avoid: I should ensure I'm not making an error by accepting less than my outside offer or wasting the opportunity for a better deal.

I value item 4 very little (only 3 per unit) and item 5 moderately (36 per unit) compared to items 1, 2, and 3 (57, 82, and 65, respectively). Meanwhile, although I do not know Player 2\u2019s private numbers, on average their per\u2010unit value will be around 51 (the midpoint of 1\u2013101). Their total \u201cbasket\u201d if they got everything would be roughly 18\u00d751 \u2248 918. So we expect (on average) they\u2019d want roughly half that value (about 459) when deciding between a deal and their private outside offer (which is drawn uniformly between 1 and their total value).\n\nA natural \u201cfair\u201d target is to give Player 2 an expected value of about 459 (assuming 51 per unit on average) while keeping as much as possible for myself in terms of my highly valued items. Notice that if we think in \u201cunits of 51\u201d then 459/51 \u2248 9 units allocated to Player 2 would be just on target.

In my allocation that would then be: item 1: 4, item 2: 1, item 3: 4, item 4: 0, item 5: 0. My deal payoff becomes 4\u00d757 + 1\u00d782 + 4\u00d765 = 228 + 82 + 260 = 570. This looks attractive compared both to my very low outside offer (96) and the potential losses if negotiations drag on through the discount factor. (Recall the discount factor is \u03b3 = 0.98 so later deals are slightly \u201cworth less\u201d in present\u2010terms.)\n\nThus, to start negotiations in round 1, I propose giving Player 2 all of item 4 (6 units) and all of item 5 (3 units). This is a valid offer (each number is between 0 and the total available for that item).\n\nSo my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 6, 3]}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 1, 0, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    24 x 4 + 23 x 1 + 87 x 0 + 73 x 0 + 67 x 1\n    which is 186 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 187. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "My reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. My private values are very skewed: item 2 is extremely valuable to me (value 71 each) so I want to keep every unit of item 2. In contrast, the items I value less (items 1, 4, and 5 especially) I can use as \u201cconcessions\u201d to induce Player\u00a02 to accept.\n\n2. My total full\u2010bundle value is 653, and I have an outside option (disagreement value) of 331. In round 1 the discount factor is 1 so I must get more than 331 in my obtained value. At the same time Player\u00a02\u2019s private outside offer (which is unknown but on average will be about half of their full\u2010bundle value) is expected to be near 510 (since the total full value to a uniformly drawn opponent is around 1020). Thus I need to \u201cbuy\u201d Player\u00a02\u2019s agreement by offering them a bundle that in expectation is worth roughly 510 (in their own eyes).\n\n3. Among the items available in types 1,3,4,5 (since I plan to keep all 5 units of item 2 for myself), the total is worth (to me) 8 + 132 + 68 + 90 = 298. However, in expectation (using a mean per\u2010unit value of about 51 for Player\u00a02) these items are worth much more to them. In order to \u201cspend\u201d about 510 of their expected value while keeping as much surplus myself as possible, I can choose to allocate roughly 10 units (since 10\u00d751\u2248510) of these 15 available units to Player\u00a02.\n\n4. I look for the low\u2010cost (to me) items to offer. For example:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 1: I value each unit only 4 while the expected value for the opponent is ~51. I give all 2 units.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Next, item 4 (4 units available) costs me 17 per unit. Giving these 4 units adds about 4\u00d751 = 204 in opponent\u2019s expected value.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 At this point the opponent\u2019s expected value is 2\u00d751 (102) + 4\u00d751 (204) = 306. He still needs about 510 \u2013 306 = 204 expected points.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 I can then offer him 4 units of item 5 (each with 18 for me vs. ~51 for him). This adds 4\u00d751 = 204 in expected value.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 The items in category 3 (worth 33 per units to me) I then keep, because they \u201ccost\u201d me more relatively.\n\n5. Under this division, my retained items are:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 All 5 units of item 2 (5\u00d771 = 355)\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 All 4 units of item 3 (4\u00d733 = 132)\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 The remaining 1 unit of item 5 (18)\n\u2003\u2003giving me a total of 355 + 132 + 18 = 505, well above my outside option.\n\u2003\u2003Player\u00a02 gets:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 1: 2 units,\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 4: 4 units,\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 5: 4 units,\n\u2003\u2003which in expectation gives roughly 2\u00d751 + 4\u00d751 + 4\u00d751 = 102 + 204 + 204 = 510.\n\n6. This initial offer is both valid (each item\u2019s offered quantity does not exceed the available total) and strategically designed \u2013 I keep my high\u2010value item 2 and most of item 3 while \u201cbuying off\u201d Player\u00a02 with items that cost me little.\n\nThus, my action in round 1 is to propose the initial offer that gives Player\u00a02: 2 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 0, 4, 4]}",

This means that waiting longer reduces the effective value of the gains from the negotiation due to the discounting.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer gives me [2, 0, 0, 4, 4]. Calculating the value:\n     - 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 64 = 128\n     - 0 units of item 2: 0 \u00d7 13 = 0\n     - 0 units of item 3: 0 \u00d7 44 = 0\n     - 4 units of item 4: 4 \u00d7 78 = 312\n     - 4 units of item 5: 4 \u00d7 42 = 168\n     - Total value if I accept this offer = 128 + 0 + 0 + 312 + 168 = 608\n\n   The total value of the current offer is 608. \n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - Evaluate the current offer: The value of accepting the current offer is 608. My outside offer is 613, so accepting the current offer would be accepting a lesser value than walking away.\n   - Evaluate a counteroffer: To avoid mistakes, any counteroffer I propose should increase my total value to at least 613 (my outside offer value). I'll consider the following counteroffer, keeping in mind that I can't make an offer worse for me than my outside offer value.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I need to ensure my total value is above 613. If I propose [0, 1, 2, 3, 3] to Player 1, keeping [2, 4, 2, 1, 2] for myself:\n  - 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 64 = 128\n  - 4 units of item 2: 4 \u00d7 13 = 52\n  - 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 44 = 88\n  - 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 78 = 78\n  - 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 42 = 84\n  - Total value = 128 + 52 + 88 + 78 + 84 = 430 (Which is not acceptable, hence I will reconsider the division)\n\nAfter adjusting further to reach value beyond 613:\n  - I will keep [1, 4, 4, 2, 1] for myself, offering [1, 1, 0, 2, 4] to Player 1:\n  - 1 unit of item 1: 1 \u00d7 64 = 64\n  - 4 units of item 2: 4 \u00d7 13 = 52\n  - 4 units of item 3: 4 \u00d7 44 = 176\n  - 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 78 = 156\n  - 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 42 = 42\n  - Total value = 64 + 52 + 176 + 156 + 42 = 490 (Which is still unacceptable)\n\nAfter further attempts, offering a final:\n  - Keeping [1, 4, 2, 3, 2] for myself offering [1, 1, 2, 1, 3]:\n  - Total value if I keep [1, 4, 2, 2, 2] for myself, (Offer: [1, 1, 2, 1, 3] to Player 1):\n  - 1 unit of item 1: 1 \u00d7 64 = 64\n  - 4 units of item 2: 4 \u00d7 13 = 52\n  - 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 44 = 88\n  - 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 78 = 234\n  - 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 42 = 84\n  - Total value = 64 + 52 + 88 + 234 + 84 = 522 (Which is also unacceptable)\n\nRevisiting a better offer for me:\n  - Keeping [2, 5, 0, 3, 0] for myself and offering [0, 0, 4, 1, 5]:\n  - Total value:\n  - 2 unit of item 1: 2 \u00d7 64 = 128\n  - 5 units of item 2: 5 \u00d7 13 = 65\n  - 0 units of item 3: 0 \u00d7 44 = 0\n  - 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 78 = 234\n  - 0 units of item 5: 0 \u00d7 42 = 0\n  - Total value = 128 + 65 + 0 + 234 + 0 = 427 (Which remains unacceptable)\n\nThus, no further iterations seem to provide a value exceeding 613. Therefore, it's wise in this scenario to:\n\n- WALK, as no conceivable counteroffer gives a value that surpasses my outside offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",
