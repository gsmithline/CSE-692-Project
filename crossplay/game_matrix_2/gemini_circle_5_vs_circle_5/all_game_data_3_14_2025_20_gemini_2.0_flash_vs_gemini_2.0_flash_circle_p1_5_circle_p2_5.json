This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items.

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

This means accepting an offer in a later round is slightly less valuable than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** There is no current offer.\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** Let's consider some potential counteroffers. I need to ensure that the value I keep is greater than my outside offer of 686. Also, I should avoid offering nothing or everything in the first round.\n\n3) **Making a Decision:**\nSince there is no offer, I need to make a counteroffer. Let's start by figuring out how many of each item I need to keep to exceed my outside offer value. I'll try to offer a \"fair\" division initially, keeping slightly more value for myself.\n\nLet's start with keeping [3, 6, 1, 2, 4] units of items 1-5 and offering the remainder to Player 2. My value for this division would be:\n\n(3 * 12) + (6 * 68) + (1 * 1) + (2 * 97) + (4 * 33) = 36 + 408 + 1 + 194 + 132 = 771\n\nSince 771 is greater than my outside offer value of 686, this is a reasonable offer to start with. I will offer the remaining units to Player 2, that would be:\nItem 1: 5 - 3 = 2\nItem 2: 10 - 6 = 4\nItem 3: 3 - 1 = 2\nItem 4: 3 - 2 = 1\nItem 5: 6 - 4 = 2\n\nMy offer to player 2 is therefore [2, 4, 2, 1, 2]\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 4, 2, 1, 2]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value: 1135\n   - Values of the items: item 1 = 86, item 2 = 6, item 3 = 67, item 4 = 99, item 5 = 32\n   - Total pool of items: 5 units of item 1, 10 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5.\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.98. This means that accepting an offer in a later round is worth slightly less than accepting the same offer in an earlier round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer: Player 1 offers me [2, 4, 2, 1, 2]. This means they are offering me 2 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n   - My value if I accept the current offer:\n     - 2 * 86 + 4 * 6 + 2 * 67 + 1 * 99 + 2 * 32 = 172 + 24 + 134 + 99 + 64 = 493\n   - How does this compare to my outside offer? 493 < 1135. Accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\n3) **Consider a counteroffer:**\nI need to propose a division such that my value is greater than 1135. Since the discount factor is small, let's aim for a value of at least 1135 in this round. The total value of all items is:\n5 * 86 + 10 * 6 + 3 * 67 + 3 * 99 + 6 * 32 = 430 + 60 + 201 + 297 + 192 = 1180\nI need to keep enough items such that the total value is greater than 1135. I will start by calculating the difference between total value and my outside offer:\n1180 - 1135 = 45\nI want to find an offer to player 1 that makes the value of my kept items greater than 1135.\n\nLet's make a counteroffer. Let's start by giving Player 1 a minimal amount of items, and see how it looks. I want to be above 1135. I need to keep a total value of greater than 1135.\nLet's try giving Player 1 [1, 6, 0, 0, 0]. Then I would keep [4, 4, 3, 3, 6]. My value is:\n4 * 86 + 4 * 6 + 3 * 67 + 3 * 99 + 6 * 32 = 344 + 24 + 201 + 297 + 192 = 1058\nThis is not enough.\n\nI need to have at least value 1135, therefore I should offer a small value to the other player.\nLet's try to give only item 2 to Player 1. That would be offering them all 10 units of item 2, so the counteroffer would be [0, 10, 0, 0, 0]\nMy value would be 5 * 86 + 0 * 6 + 3 * 67 + 3 * 99 + 6 * 32 = 430 + 0 + 201 + 297 + 192 = 1120\nThis is not greater than 1135. \n\nSince I need at least 1135, I will make an offer to give them nothing of value to me.\nLet's try offering Player 1 the minimum possible amount: giving 0 of each item, so [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Then my value is the total value: 1180 > 1135.\n\nBased on this analysis, I will make a counteroffer where I give the other player nothing.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

My value would be 0.\n*   **Value of keeping all items:** (5 * 12) + (10 * 68) + (3 * 1) + (3 * 97) + (6 * 33) = 60 + 680 + 3 + 291 + 198 = 1232\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\nThe current offer is terrible (0 value).

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1135. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 870 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 2, 3, 3, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party.

For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 0, 0, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 185\n*   **Values of the items:** Item 1 = 5, Item 2 = 91, Item 3 = 23, Item 4 = 60, Item 5 = 58\n*   **Total pool of items:** Item 1 = 5, Item 2 = 4, Item 3 = 5, Item 4 = 2, Item 5 = 3\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.98. This means that accepting an offer in a later round is slightly less valuable than accepting the same offer in an earlier round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]. This means I get 1 unit of item 3. My value for this offer is 1 * 23 = 23.\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** 23 is much less than my outside offer of 185.\n\nNow, let's consider a few potential counteroffers. I want to find an offer that gives me a value greater than 185.\n\n*   **Scenario 1: Give Player 1 nothing.** I keep everything.\n    *   Value = (5 * 5) + (4 * 91) + (5 * 23) + (2 * 60) + (3 * 58) = 25 + 364 + 115 + 120 + 174 = 798. This is significantly better than my outside offer. I definitely don't want to give *everything* away.\n\n*   **Scenario 2: Aim for roughly half the value for myself (around 400) and offering the other half.** Since Item 2 is the most valuable, let me start by giving player 1 some of those. Let's try offering Player 1: [2,2,2,1,1].\n    *   My remaining items: [3, 2, 3, 1, 2]\n    *   My value: (3 * 5) + (2 * 91) + (3 * 23) + (1 * 60) + (2 * 58) = 15 + 182 + 69 + 60 + 116 = 442. This is much better than my outside offer.\n\n*   **Scenario 3: Try to improve on Scenario 2 to favor myself more. Offer Player 1: [3,3,3,1,1]**\n    *   My remaining items: [2, 1, 2, 1, 2]\n    *   My value: (2 * 5) + (1 * 91) + (2 * 23) + (1 * 60) + (2 * 58) = 10 + 91 + 46 + 60 + 116 = 323. This is much better than my outside offer.\n\n*   **Scenario 4: Offer Player 1: [4,4,4,2,2]**\n    *   My remaining items: [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]\n    *   My value: (1 * 5) + (0 * 91) + (1 * 23) + (0 * 60) + (1 * 58) = 5 + 0 + 23 + 0 + 58 = 86. This is less than my outside offer!\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer of [0, 0, 1, 0, 0] is terrible. I should definitely counteroffer. Scenario 2 gives me a good value (442). I will use this as my counter offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 2, 1, 1]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

This means that an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 0.98^2 = 0.9604 of its face value, compared to the present round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer:** I am being offered [2, 2, 2, 1, 1]. This means I would receive:\n      - 2 units of item 1: 2 * 60 = 120\n      - 2 units of item 2: 2 * 55 = 110\n      - 2 units of item 3: 2 * 29 = 58\n      - 1 unit of item 4: 1 * 11 = 11\n      - 1 unit of item 5: 1 * 23 = 23\n      - Total value: 120 + 110 + 58 + 11 + 23 = 322\n\n   - **Compare to outside offer:**  322 is significantly less than my outside offer of 624.  Therefore, accepting this offer would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\n\n   - **Consider a counteroffer:** I need to calculate a counteroffer that yields a value greater than 624.  Since this is Round 2, and the other agent previously offered me [2, 2, 2, 1, 1], I need to factor in the discount. If I walk away now, my offer is 624. If I offer something now and they accept, it will be worth the offer's value * 0.98.\n\n   I will try to offer them something that ensures I retain at least 624 value. I can propose keeping all items 1, 2, and 4, plus one unit of item 3 and all of item 5. That would be [0, 0, 4, 0, 0].\n   That leaves me with:\n      - 5 units of item 1: 5 * 60 = 300\n      - 4 units of item 2: 4 * 55 = 220\n      - 1 unit of item 3: 1 * 29 = 29\n      - 2 units of item 4: 2 * 11 = 22\n      - 3 units of item 5: 3 * 23 = 69\n      Total Value: 300+220+29+22+69 = 640, which is better than my outside option.\n\n   Now, if I propose offering player 2 [0,0,4,0,0] now, and player 2 accepts, my value is 640. If I walk away, my value is 624.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\n   - The current offer is unacceptable (322 < 624).\n   - I will make a counteroffer to retain enough value and hope the other player accepts.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 4, 0, 0]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 624. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 534 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 2, 5, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    60 x 5 + 55 x 2 + 29 x 5 + 11 x 2 + 23 x 2\n    which is 623 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 624. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 2, 2, 1, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 4, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 4, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 4, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 624\n*   My values for the items: item 1: 60, item 2: 55, item 3: 29, item 4: 11, item 5: 23\n*   Total items: item 1: 5, item 2: 4, item 3: 5, item 4: 2, item 5: 3\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.98.  This means accepting an offer now is worth slightly more than the same offer next round. Since this is the final round, the discount doesn't matter.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am offered [1, 0, 4, 0, 0]. This means I get 1 unit of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n    My value from the current offer: (1 * 60) + (0 * 55) + (4 * 29) + (0 * 11) + (0 * 23) = 60 + 0 + 116 + 0 + 0 = 176.\n*   This is less than my outside offer of 624.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 624.  Let's start by calculating the value of keeping all items:\n    (5 * 60) + (4 * 55) + (5 * 29) + (2 * 11) + (3 * 23) = 300 + 220 + 145 + 22 + 69 = 756.\n\n    I need to make sure whatever items I give to Player 2 keeps me above the outside offer value of 624. Let's explore some counteroffers.\n\n    **Counteroffer 1:** Give Player 2 [1, 2, 1, 1, 1]:\n    My remaining items: [4, 2, 4, 1, 2]\n    My value: (4 * 60) + (2 * 55) + (4 * 29) + (1 * 11) + (2 * 23) = 240 + 110 + 116 + 11 + 46 = 523.  This is less than my outside offer.\n\n    **Counteroffer 2:** Give Player 2 [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]:\n    My remaining items: [5, 3, 5, 2, 3]\n    My value: (5 * 60) + (3 * 55) + (5 * 29) + (2 * 11) + (3 * 23) = 300 + 165 + 145 + 22 + 69 = 701. This is greater than my outside offer of 624.\n\n    **Counteroffer 3:** Give Player 2 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]:\n    My remaining items: [5, 4, 5, 2, 3]\n    My value: (5 * 60) + (4 * 55) + (5 * 29) + (2 * 11) + (3 * 23) = 300 + 220 + 145 + 22 + 69 = 756. This is greater than my outside offer of 624.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer (176) is worse than my outside offer (624). I need to propose a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer. I can see that offering nothing (keeping all items) will give me a value of 756. Let's try offering very little to Player 2.\n\nSince this is the last round, Player 2 will walk away if I propose a counteroffer.\n\nTherefore, I should walk away and take my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 197. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 197. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 768 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 2, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    91 x 0 + 19 x 2 + 57 x 2 + 47 x 0 + 42 x 1\n    which is 194 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 197. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

This means that waiting for future rounds reduces the value of any deal by a factor of 0.98 per round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer. I need to propose an offer.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find a division of items that gives me a value greater than my outside offer. Since it's the first round, there's no urgency due to the discount factor. Let's explore some possible offers, keeping in mind the total amounts of each item.\n\n    *   **Offer 1 (Give half of everything to Player 2):**\n\n        *   Item 1: 0 to Player 2, 0 to me\n        *   Item 2: 1 to Player 2, 1 to me\n        *   Item 3: 3 to Player 2, 3 to me\n        *   Item 4: 0 to Player 2, 1 to me\n        *   Item 5: 2 to Player 2, 2 to me\n\n        *   My value: (1 * 19) + (3 * 57) + (1 * 47) + (2 * 42) = 19 + 171 + 47 + 84 = 321\n\n        *   This offer gives me 321, which is better than my outside offer of 197.\n    *   **Offer 2 (Give most of the items to Player 2):**\n\n        *   Item 1: 0 to Player 2, 0 to me\n        *   Item 2: 2 to Player 2, 0 to me\n        *   Item 3: 5 to Player 2, 1 to me\n        *   Item 4: 1 to Player 2, 0 to me\n        *   Item 5: 3 to Player 2, 1 to me\n\n        *   My value: (1 * 57) + (1 * 42) = 99\n\n        *   This offer gives me 99, which is worse than my outside offer of 197. So, this is not good.\n    *   **Offer 3 (Give the bare minimum to Player 2):**\n\n        *   Item 1: 0 to Player 2, 0 to me\n        *   Item 2: 0 to Player 2, 2 to me\n        *   Item 3: 0 to Player 2, 6 to me\n        *   Item 4: 0 to Player 2, 1 to me\n        *   Item 5: 0 to Player 2, 4 to me\n\n        *   My value: (2 * 19) + (6 * 57) + (1 * 47) + (4 * 42) = 38 + 342 + 47 + 168 = 595\n\n        *   This offer gives me 595. Since it's Round 1, and I need to leave room for negotiation, I can propose a slightly more generous offer than giving nothing.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nBased on the value assessment above, Offer 1 gives me a good amount, and there's still room for negotiation if necessary.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\n1) **Current Situation:**\n   - My outside offer value: 1015\n   - Item values: item 1: 98, item 2: 90, item 3: 86, item 4: 74, item 5: 96\n   - Total items: 0 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 6 of item 3, 1 of item 4, 4 of item 5\n   - Discount factor: 0.98. This means waiting a round reduces the value of any deal by 2%.\n\n2) **Assess the value of the current offer:**\n   - Current offer to me: [0, 1, 3, 0, 2]\n   - Items I keep: [0, 2, 6, 1, 4] - [0, 1, 3, 0, 2] = [0, 1, 3, 1, 2]\n   - Value of what I keep: (0 * 98) + (1 * 90) + (3 * 86) + (1 * 74) + (2 * 96) = 0 + 90 + 258 + 74 + 192 = 614\n\n3) **Compare to outside offer:**\n   - 614 < 1015, so accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\n4) **Consider a counteroffer:** I need to find an offer [n1, n2, n3, n4, n5] such that the value of what I keep is greater than 1015. What I keep will be [0-n1, 2-n2, 6-n3, 1-n4, 4-n5]. Thus, my value is 98*(0-n1) + 90*(2-n2) + 86*(6-n3) + 74*(1-n4) + 96*(4-n5) which is 180 + 516 + 74 + 384 - 98*n1 - 90*n2 - 86*n3 - 74*n4 - 96*n5 = 1154 - 98*n1 - 90*n2 - 86*n3 - 74*n4 - 96*n5. I want to find an offer to the other player that yields me at least 1015, so 1154 - 98*n1 - 90*n2 - 86*n3 - 74*n4 - 96*n5 >= 1015. Which means 139 >= 98*n1 + 90*n2 + 86*n3 + 74*n4 + 96*n5. Since n1, n2, n3, n4 and n5 must be greater than or equal to 0. I can't give the other player too much, or else it is less than my outside offer.\n\n5) Try giving player 1 nothing, so [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], I keep everything: 1154 which is better than my outside offer.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 197. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 768 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 2, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    91 x 0 + 19 x 2 + 57 x 2 + 47 x 0 + 42 x 1\n    which is 194 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 197. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 3, 0, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value is 197.\n*   My values for the items are: item 1: 91, item 2: 19, item 3: 57, item 4: 47, item 5: 42.\n*   The total pool of items is: item 1: 0, item 2: 2, item 3: 6, item 4: 1, item 5: 4.\n*   The discount factor is 0.98. This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.98 times its value, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 0.98^2 times its value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** The current offer is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I receive 0 units of each item. Thus, Player 2 gets all of the items. The items I keep are: item 1: 0, item 2: 2, item 3: 6, item 4: 1, item 5: 4. My value for this is: 0 * 91 + 2 * 19 + 6 * 57 + 1 * 47 + 4 * 42 = 0 + 38 + 342 + 47 + 168 = 595.\n*   Since the offer is in round 2, the discounted value is 595 * 0.98 = 583.1.\n*   **Counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that yields a value greater than my outside offer of 197. I also need to consider the discount factor for the current round (0.98).\n\nLet's consider some potential counteroffers. I need to offer Player 2 an amount of each item and calculate how much value *I* retain:\n\n*   **Offer 1:** Offer Player 2 half of item 3 and half of item 5. Offer: [0, 0, 3, 0, 2]. This means I keep 0 item 1, 2 item 2, 3 item 3, 1 item 4, and 2 item 5.  My value is 0 * 91 + 2 * 19 + 3 * 57 + 1 * 47 + 2 * 42 = 0 + 38 + 171 + 47 + 84 = 340. Discounted, this is 340 * 0.98 = 333.2, which is better than my outside offer of 197.\n\n*   **Offer 2:** Give player everything but 1 item 4. Offer: [0, 2, 6, 0, 4]. My retained value = 0 * 91 + 0 * 19 + 0 * 57 + 1 * 47 + 0 * 42 = 47. This is worse than my outside offer, so this is a bad move.\n\n*   **Offer 3:** Give player 0 of everything. This is the same as the current offer, which gives me 583.1.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer is [0,0,0,0,0]. If I accept it, I will receive a discounted payoff of 583.1, which is greater than my outside offer of 197. Therefore, I should accept this offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

This means I get:\n    *   2 units of item 1\n    *   1 unit of item 2\n    *   2 units of item 3\n    *   1 unit of item 4\n    *   1 unit of item 5\n*   Value of the current offer:\n    *   (2 * 90) + (1 * 55) + (2 * 55) + (1 * 79) + (1 * 84) = 180 + 55 + 110 + 79 + 84 = 508\n\n3) **Compare to outside offer:**\n\n*   The current offer is worth 508 to me. My outside offer is 447.\n*   Since 508 > 447, the current offer is better than my outside offer.\n\n4) **Consider a counteroffer:**\n\n*   I want to maximize my value. The current offer is better than my outside offer. I want to be careful not to make a worse offer than the current offer.\n*   I will create a counteroffer that gives Player 1 a little less and gives me a little more.\n\n5) **Crafting a counteroffer:**\n\nLet's aim for a division that is more favorable to me, but still reasonable enough for Player 1 to consider. I'll try offering Player 1 [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]:\n\n*   This means I would keep:\n    *   Item 1: 6 - 1 = 5\n    *   Item 2: 1 - 0 = 1\n    *   Item 3: 6 - 1 = 5\n    *   Item 4: 3 - 0 = 3\n    *   Item 5: 3 - 0 = 3\n*   My value for this: (5 * 90) + (1 * 55) + (5 * 55) + (3 * 79) + (3 * 84) = 450 + 55 + 275 + 237 + 252 = 1269\n\nThis is a very good outcome for me!\n\n**Decision:**\n\nThe current offer is acceptable, but I think I can get a better deal.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [6, 0, 3, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    83 x 6 + 44 x 0 + 67 x 3 + 51 x 0 + 21 x 0\n    which is 699 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 700. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 2, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n1) **Current Situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 700\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 83, Item 2: 44, Item 3: 67, Item 4: 51, Item 5: 21\n*   **Total items:** Item 1: 6, Item 2: 1, Item 3: 6, Item 4: 3, Item 5: 3\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.98.  This means accepting an offer in a later round is slightly less valuable than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]. This means I would get:\n    *   1 unit of Item 1: 1 * 83 = 83\n    *   0 units of Item 2: 0 * 44 = 0\n    *   1 unit of Item 3: 1 * 67 = 67\n    *   0 units of Item 4: 0 * 51 = 0\n    *   0 units of Item 5: 0 * 21 = 0\n    *   Total value = 83 + 0 + 67 + 0 + 0 = 150\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** 150 is much less than my outside offer of 700. Therefore, accepting this offer would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\n\nNow, let's consider what I could get if I make a counteroffer. I need to keep enough items to be worth more than 700. I currently have the chance to make an offer now in round 2, and I also need to consider that Player 2 made a counteroffer.\n\nLet's consider keeping all of items 1 and 3. This is 6*83 + 6*67 = 498 + 402 = 900.\n\nTo avoid Mistake 3 (offering all or nothing), let's consider a reasonable counteroffer. Round 1, I offered [2, 1, 2, 1, 1]. In Round 2, Player 2 offered [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]. Let's try to improve from my original offer, but also stay in the game.\n\nI have the following in my possession, if I reject the current offer:\nItem 1: 6\nItem 2: 1\nItem 3: 6\nItem 4: 3\nItem 5: 3\n\nLet's try offering Player 2 [2, 0, 2, 1, 1].\nThis would leave me with:\nItem 1: 4, value = 4*83 = 332\nItem 2: 1, value = 1*44 = 44\nItem 3: 4, value = 4*67 = 268\nItem 4: 2, value = 2*51 = 102\nItem 5: 2, value = 2*21 = 42\nTotal = 332 + 44 + 268 + 102 + 42 = 788\n\n788 is greater than my outside offer of 700.\nAlso, this counteroffer is \"better\" for me than accepting the current offer and also better than walking away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 2, 1, 1]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 5, 2, 2, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    28 x 3 + 6 x 5 + 28 x 2 + 20 x 2 + 98 x 1\n    which is 308 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 310. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

I will start by offering a relatively small amount and see how Player 2 responds. My goal is to secure at least my outside offer value (310).\nLet's start by offering player 2 one unit of item 1 and one unit of item 4.\nThis means I keep 3 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4 and 1 unit of item 5\nMy value would be:\n3 * 28 + 6 * 6 + 2 * 28 + 2 * 20 + 1 * 98 = 84 + 36 + 56 + 40 + 98 = 314\n\nSince 314 > 310, offering one unit of item 1 and one unit of item 4 gives me a higher value than my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]}\n```",

This means that accepting an offer in a later round is slightly less valuable than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** The current offer is [1, 0, 0, 1, 0] (offered to me). This means I would get 1 unit of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n    *   Value of current offer: (1 * 70) + (0 * 24) + (0 * 41) + (1 * 21) + (0 * 49) = 70 + 0 + 0 + 21 + 0 = 91.\n\nThis value of 91 is less than my outside offer of 293. Therefore, accepting this offer would be a mistake.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 293.\n\nLet's consider several possible counteroffers to Player 1 and calculate their value to me. My resources are:\n4 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n\n*   **Keep all items:** Value = (4 * 70) + (6 * 24) + (2 * 41) + (3 * 21) + (1 * 49) = 280 + 144 + 82 + 63 + 49 = 618.\n*   **Give Player 1 nothing (counteroffer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]):** My value = 618 (as above). This is much greater than my outside offer.\n*   **Give Player 1 1 unit of each item (counteroffer [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]):** I keep [3, 5, 1, 2, 0]. Value = (3 * 70) + (5 * 24) + (1 * 41) + (2 * 21) + (0 * 49) = 210 + 120 + 41 + 42 + 0 = 413.\n*   **Give Player 1 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2 (counteroffer [2, 1, 0, 0, 0]):** I keep [2, 5, 2, 3, 1]. Value = (2 * 70) + (5 * 24) + (2 * 41) + (3 * 21) + (1 * 49) = 140 + 120 + 82 + 63 + 49 = 454.\n*   **Give Player 1 1 unit of item 1, 2 unit of item 2 (counteroffer [1, 2, 0, 0, 0]):** I keep [3, 4, 2, 3, 1].

I can either walk away or make a counteroffer. Given that there are 3 rounds, I should attempt to negotiate. I want to make a counteroffer that benefits me more than my outside offer, and also is reasonable enough that Player 1 may accept.\n\nLet's try the counteroffer [1, 2, 0, 0, 0].

I keep [3, 4, 1, 2, 1].\n    My value: (3 * 28) + (4 * 6) + (1 * 28) + (2 * 20) + (1 * 98) = 84 + 24 + 28 + 40 + 98 = 274. This is below my outside offer.\n\n    Let's offer [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]. I keep [4, 5, 2, 2, 1]\n    My value: (4 * 28) + (5 * 6) + (2 * 28) + (2 * 20) + (1 * 98) = 112 + 30 + 56 + 40 + 98 = 336. This is better than my outside offer and slightly better than my last offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Accepting the current offer is terrible (value = 39.2).\n*   Walking away gives me 310.\n*   Offering [0, 1, 0, 1, 0] is a good option, yielding me a value of 336.\n\nTherefore, I will make a counteroffer of [0, 1, 0, 1, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 2, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    70 x 2 + 24 x 0 + 41 x 2 + 21 x 1 + 49 x 1\n    which is 292 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 293. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 2, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 293.\n   - My values for the items are: item 1 = 70, item 2 = 24, item 3 = 41, item 4 = 21, item 5 = 49.\n   - The total pool of items is: 4 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5.\n   - The discount factor is 0.98. Since we are in round 2, any accepted offer will be multiplied by 0.98^(2-1) = 0.98.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]. This means I would get:\n      - 0 units of item 1\n      - 1 unit of item 2\n      - 0 units of item 3\n      - 1 unit of item 4\n      - 0 units of item 5\n      - My value for this offer is (0 * 70) + (1 * 24) + (0 * 41) + (1 * 21) + (0 * 49) = 24 + 21 = 45.\n      - Discounted value of accepting current offer: 45 * 0.98 = 44.1\n\n   - **Comparison to outside offer:** 44.1 is less than my outside offer of 293. Therefore, accepting the current offer would be a Mistake 4.\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that results in a value greater than 293. Let's explore a few possibilities, keeping in mind that I want to offer Player 1 as little as possible while still maximizing my own value:\n\n    **Try keeping [4, 6, 2, 3, 1] for myself - offering [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]:**\n    Value = (4 * 70) + (6 * 24) + (2 * 41) + (3 * 21) + (1 * 49) = 280 + 144 + 82 + 63 + 49 = 618. Offering [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] is Mistake 3.\n\n    Let's try to give back some of the plentiful item 2 while keeping most of the high-value items 1, 3 and 5:\n    **Offer [0, 4, 0, 0, 0]. Keeping [4, 2, 2, 3, 1]:**\n    Value = (4 * 70) + (2 * 24) + (2 * 41) + (3 * 21) + (1 * 49) = 280 + 48 + 82 + 63 + 49 = 522\n\n    **Offer [0, 3, 0, 0, 0]. Keeping [4, 3, 2, 3, 1]:**\n    Value = (4 * 70) + (3 * 24) + (2 * 41) + (3 * 21) + (1 * 49) = 280 + 72 + 82 + 63 + 49 = 546\n\n    **Offer [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]. Keeping [4, 4, 2, 3, 1]:**\n    Value = (4 * 70) + (4 * 24) + (2 * 41) + (3 * 21) + (1 * 49) = 280 + 96 + 82 + 63 + 49 = 570\n\n    **Offer [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]. Keeping [4, 5, 2, 3, 1]:**\n    Value = (4 * 70) + (5 * 24) + (2 * 41) + (3 * 21) + (1 * 49) = 280 + 120 + 82 + 63 + 49 = 594\n\n    **Offer [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Keeping [3, 6, 2, 3, 1]:**\n    Value = (3 * 70) + (6 * 24) + (2 * 41) + (3 * 21) + (1 * 49) = 210 + 144 + 82 + 63 + 49 = 548\n\n    **Offer [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]. Keeping [4, 6, 2, 2, 1]:**\n    Value = (4 * 70) + (6 * 24) + (2 * 41) + (2 * 21) + (1 * 49) = 280 + 144 + 82 + 42 + 49 = 597\n\n    **Offer [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]. Keeping [4, 6, 1, 3, 1]:**\n    Value = (4 * 70) + (6 * 24) + (1 * 41) + (3 * 21) + (1 * 49) = 280 + 144 + 41 + 63 + 49 = 577\n\nLet's try a different tactic. Let's see if we can just take all item 1 and the one unit of item 5.\n**Offer [0, 0, 2, 3, 0]. Keeping [4, 6, 0, 0, 1]:**\nValue = (4 * 70) + (6 * 24) + (0 * 41) + (0 * 21) + (1 * 49) = 280 + 144 + 0 + 0 + 49 = 473\n\nWe need to get something to Player 1 to induce them to accept. Given the previous offer of Player 1 was [0, 1, 0, 1, 0], perhaps they value items 2 and 4. Let's see.\n**Offer [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]. Keeping [4, 5, 2, 2, 1]:**\nValue = (4 * 70) + (5 * 24) + (2 * 41) + (2 * 21) + (1 * 49) = 280 + 120 + 82 + 42 + 49 = 573\n\nIt seems that keeping most of item 1 is crucial for a good value.\n\nLet's try offering more item 2.\n**Offer [0, 5, 0, 0, 0]. Keeping [4, 1, 2, 3, 1]:**\nValue = (4 * 70) + (1 * 24) + (2 * 41) + (3 * 21) + (1 * 49) = 280 + 24 + 82 + 63 + 49 = 498\n\nOkay, after a number of tries, it seems we need a stronger offer to get value > 293.\nLet's try offering [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]. Keeping [3, 5, 2, 2, 1]:\nValue = (3 * 70) + (5 * 24) + (2 * 41) + (2 * 21) + (1 * 49) = 210 + 120 + 82 + 42 + 49 = 503\n\nSince this is round 2, it is getting tight. I will go for an offer that yields me substantially more than my outside option of 293. Let me offer Player 1 [1, 2, 0, 1, 0]. Keeping [3, 4, 2, 2, 1].\nValue = (3 * 70) + (4 * 24) + (2 * 41) + (2 * 21) + (1 * 49) = 210 + 96 + 82 + 42 + 49 = 479\n\nI will go with offering Player 1 [1, 2, 0, 1, 0] to get to an agreement as the last counteroffer is basically a WALK.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 0, 1, 0]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 2, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    70 x 2 + 24 x 0 + 41 x 2 + 21 x 1 + 49 x 1\n    which is 292 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 293. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 2, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [1, 2, 0, 1, 0]\nRound 3: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 0, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 0, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Current Situation Analysis:**\n\n   - My outside offer value: 293\n   - Item values: item 1 = 70, item 2 = 24, item 3 = 41, item 4 = 21, item 5 = 49\n   - Total items: 4 of item 1, 6 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 3 of item 4, 1 of item 5\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.98.  Since this is round 3, the discount factor is 0.98^(3-1) = 0.98^2 = 0.9604. This means accepting an offer now is worth 96.04% of its face value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current Offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 2, 0, 1, 0]. This means I get 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n     - Value of current offer: (1 * 70) + (2 * 24) + (0 * 41) + (1 * 21) + (0 * 49) = 70 + 48 + 0 + 21 + 0 = 139.\n     - Discounted value of current offer: 139 * 0.9604 = 133.4956\n     - Since 133.4956 < 293, accepting this offer is worse than walking away.\n\n   - **Potential Counteroffers:** Since this is the last round, making a counteroffer is equivalent to walking away. Let's see what offer player 1 gives to us currently [1, 2, 0, 1, 0]. We have a total of [4, 6, 2, 3, 1]. Given to player 1 means the items we get are [4-1, 6-2, 2-0, 3-1, 1-0] = [3, 4, 2, 2, 1].\n   - If we keep: 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n    - Value of keeping these items: (3 * 70) + (4 * 24) + (2 * 41) + (2 * 21) + (1 * 49) = 210 + 96 + 82 + 42 + 49 = 479\n    - Discounted value of keeping these items: 479 * 0.9604 = 460.0316\n   - If we keep only [2, 0, 2, 1, 1], as in your example calculation:\n   - Value of keeping these items: (2 * 70) + (0 * 24) + (2 * 41) + (1 * 21) + (1 * 49) = 140 + 0 + 82 + 21 + 49 = 292\n    - Discounted value of keeping these items: 292 * 0.9604 = 280.4368\n\n   - **Comparison to outside offer:**\n      - The discounted value of the current offer (133.4956) is significantly less than my outside offer (293).\n      - Keeping [3, 4, 2, 2, 1], (460.0316) is significantly more than my outside offer (293).\n      - Keeping only [2, 0, 2, 1, 1] is less than my outside offer of 293.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\n   - Accepting the current offer is bad as 133.4956 < 293\n   - Since this is the last round, any counteroffer is the same as walking away.\n   - Given that accepting is worse than my outside offer, and making a counteroffer is the same as walking away. The optimal strategy is to walk away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Since this is round 1, the discount factor doesn't significantly influence my immediate decision, but it's important to consider for future rounds.\n\n2)  **Assessing Offers:**\n\n    *   Current offer: None. So, accepting is not an option.\n    *   Potential counteroffers: I need to make an offer that leaves me with a value greater than my outside offer (1584).\n\n3)  **Decision:**\n\n    *   Since I have no current offer to accept, I need to propose a counteroffer or walk away. My goal is to create an offer that is appealing enough for the other player to accept while still maximizing my value.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I offer the other player half of the available items where possible and adjust this offer to ensure my payoff is better than my outside option.\nSpecifically, I will offer the other player:\n*   item 1: 4\n*   item 2: 1\n*   item 3: 3\n*   item 4: 1\n*   item 5: 3\n\nMy value for keeping the rest is:\n*   item 1: 4 * 63 = 252\n*   item 2: 1 * 28 = 28\n*   item 3: 3 * 78 = 234\n*   item 4: 1 * 74 = 74\n*   item 5: 3 * 87 = 261\n\nTotal value for me = 252 + 28 + 234 + 74 + 261 = 849.

I will offer the other player only:\n* item 1: 1\n* item 2: 0\n* item 3: 1\n* item 4: 0\n* item 5: 1\n\nThis means I keep:\n* item 1: 7 * 63 = 441\n* item 2: 2 * 28 = 56\n* item 3: 5 * 78 = 390\n* item 4: 2 * 74 = 148\n* item 5: 5 * 87 = 435\n\nTotal value for me = 441 + 56 + 390 + 148 + 435 = 1470.  Still not good enough.\n\nLet's try offering:\n* item 1: 0\n* item 2: 0\n* item 3: 0\n* item 4: 0\n* item 5: 1\n\nThis means I keep:\n* item 1: 8 * 63 = 504\n* item 2: 2 * 28 = 56\n* item 3: 6 * 78 = 468\n* item 4: 2 * 74 = 148\n* item 5: 5 * 87 = 435\n\nTotal value for me = 504 + 56 + 468 + 148 + 435 = 1611.

This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [8, 0, 0, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    1 x 8 + 59 x 0 + 53 x 0 + 55 x 0 + 34 x 2\n    which is 76 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 77. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

This means Player 1 gets 8 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 6 of item 3, 2 of item 4 and 5 of item 5.\n   - My value if I accept: (0 * 1) + (0 * 59) + (0 * 53) + (0 * 55) + (1 * 34) = 34\n   - Comparing to outside offer: 34 < 77. Accepting this offer is worse than walking away.\n\n3) **Consider a counteroffer:**\n\nI need to create a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 77. Let's start by considering keeping all of item 2 since it has high value and only two units are available. If I keep all of item 2, the value is 2 * 59 = 118. This already exceeds the outside offer value, so a deal is possible.\n\nLet's try offering [8, 0, 6, 2, 6]. This means I keep [0, 2, 0, 0, 0], which is worth (0 * 1) + (2 * 59) + (0 * 53) + (0 * 55) + (0 * 34) = 118.

I need to calculate a counteroffer that gives Player 2 enough value to be attractive, while also ensuring I receive at least 822 in value. Let's start by exploring giving Player 2 one unit of each item.\n\nIf I give Player 2 [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] of items 1-5, I retain [2, 2, 6, 3, 0].\nValue = (2 * 100) + (2 * 96) + (6 * 5) + (3 * 28) + (0 * 91) = 200 + 192 + 30 + 84 + 0 = 506. This is much less than my outside offer.\n\nLet's aim for a counteroffer that provides me with a value close to my outside offer of 822.\n\nI will aim to offer Player 2 a significant part of item 3 and item 4 because my values for these are relatively low.\n\nLet's consider offering [0, 0, 5, 2, 0]. This means I keep [3, 3, 2, 2, 1].\nValue = (3 * 100) + (3 * 96) + (2 * 5) + (2 * 28) + (1 * 91) = 300 + 288 + 10 + 56 + 91 = 745. Still less than my outside offer.\n\nLet's consider offering [0, 0, 4, 1, 0]. This means I keep [3, 3, 3, 3, 1].\nValue = (3 * 100) + (3 * 96) + (3 * 5) + (3 * 28) + (1 * 91) = 300 + 288 + 15 + 84 + 91 = 778. Still less than my outside offer.\n\nLet's consider offering [0, 0, 3, 0, 0]. This means I keep [3, 3, 4, 4, 1].\nValue = (3 * 100) + (3 * 96) + (4 * 5) + (4 * 28) + (1 * 91) = 300 + 288 + 20 + 112 + 91 = 811. Very close to my outside offer.\n\nLet's consider offering [0, 0, 2, 0, 0]. This means I keep [3, 3, 5, 4, 1].\nValue = (3 * 100) + (3 * 96) + (5 * 5) + (4 * 28) + (1 * 91) = 300 + 288 + 25 + 112 + 91 = 816. Still less than my outside offer.\n\nLet's consider offering [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]. This means I keep [3, 3, 6, 4, 1].\nValue = (3 * 100) + (3 * 96) + (6 * 5) + (4 * 28) + (1 * 91) = 300 + 288 + 30 + 112 + 91 = 821. Still less than my outside offer.\n\nLet's consider offering [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I keep [3, 3, 7, 4, 1].\nValue = (3 * 100) + (3 * 96) + (7 * 5) + (4 * 28) + (1 * 91) = 300 + 288 + 35 + 112 + 91 = 826.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 520. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 792 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 4, 4, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    58 x 1 + 86 x 1 + 69 x 4 + 16 x 4 + 35 x 1\n    which is 519 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 520. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 520.\n   - My values for the items are: item 1 = 58, item 2 = 86, item 3 = 69, item 4 = 16, item 5 = 35.\n   - The total pool of items is: 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5.\n   - The discount factor is 0.98. This means that waiting for a future offer reduces the value of any deal by a factor of 0.98 per round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer: I am being offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I keep all the items.\n     - Value of keeping all items: (3 * 58) + (3 * 86) + (7 * 69) + (4 * 16) + (1 * 35) = 174 + 258 + 483 + 64 + 35 = 1014\n   - This value (1014) is significantly greater than my outside offer (520).\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - The current offer is extremely good for me. I get to keep everything, which is worth 1014, far exceeding my outside offer of 520.\n   - Therefore, I should accept the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

The discount factor means that an offer accepted later is worth slightly less. However, since it's only round 1, the impact is minimal at this point.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what offers I could make and their value to me. I want to make an offer that is better than my outside offer of 499, leaving enough value for Player 2 so that they will consider accepting it.\n\nNow I will consider some possible counteroffers, keeping in mind the 5 mistakes I want to avoid.\n\nHere's a possible starting point, splitting the items somewhat evenly, prioritizing giving player 2 items that I value less:\n\nOffer Player 2: `[0, 0, 1, 2, 1]`\n\nMy remaining items: `[1, 0, 2, 3, 2]`\n\nMy Value: `1*28 + 0*57 + 2*3 + 3*54 + 2*76 = 28 + 0 + 6 + 162 + 152 = 348`\n\nThis is much lower than my outside offer value. I need to offer player 2 less of the items I value highly.\n\nLet's try another split:\n\nOffer Player 2: `[0, 0, 2, 4, 2]`\n\nMy remaining items: `[1, 0, 1, 1, 1]`\n\nMy Value: `1*28 + 0*57 + 1*3 + 1*54 + 1*76 = 28 + 0 + 3 + 54 + 76 = 161`\n\nStill much lower than my outside offer value.\n\nLet's make an offer that favors me significantly, giving player 2 mostly the item 3 which I value the least.\n\nOffer Player 2: `[0, 0, 3, 0, 0]`\n\nMy remaining items: `[1, 0, 0, 5, 3]`\n\nMy value: `1*28 + 0*57 + 0*3 + 5*54 + 3*76 = 28 + 0 + 0 + 270 + 228 = 526`\n\nThis is better than my outside offer. So this is a valid counteroffer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince I have no current offer to accept or reject, and walking away would only give me my outside offer value, the best course of action is to make a counteroffer that is greater than my outside offer. The counteroffer `[0, 0, 3, 0, 0]` gives me a value of 526, which is better than walking away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 3, 0, 0]}\n```",

Then the total value is (1 * 73) + (0 * 10) + (0 * 55) + (5 * 9) + (0 * 53) = 73 + 0 + 0 + 45 + 0 = 118. Too low.\n\n    - What if I give player 1 all of the item 3, and 2 of the items 5. Then I would get 1 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 1 units of item 5. Then the total value is (1 * 73) + (0 * 10) + (0 * 55) + (5 * 9) + (1 * 53) = 73 + 0 + 0 + 45 + 53 = 171. Still too low.\n\n    - What if I give player 1 two items of item 3, two of item 4 and two of item 5? Then I would get 1 unit of item 1, 0 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 3 of item 4 and 1 of item 5. Total value = 73 + 0 + 55 + 27 + 53 = 208.\n\n    - Let's try giving Player 1 [0, 0, 2, 3, 2]. This would leave me with: 1 unit of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5. My value would be: (1 * 73) + (0 * 10) + (1 * 55) + (2 * 9) + (1 * 53) = 73 + 0 + 55 + 18 + 53 = 199. This is still less than 221.\n\n    - Let's try giving Player 1 only item 3 and two of item 4 and one of item 5. This means I keep 1 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 3 of item 4 and 2 of item 5. The offer is [0, 0, 3, 2, 1]. My value would be: 73 + 0 + 0 + 27 + 106 = 206. Still less than 221.\n\n    - Let's try giving Player 1 only item 3 and one of item 4 and item 5. This means I keep 1 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 4 of item 4 and 2 of item 5. The offer is [0, 0, 3, 1, 1]. My value would be: 73 + 0 + 0 + 36 + 106 = 215. Still less than 221.\n\n    - Let's try giving Player 1 only item 3 and zero of item 4 and item 5. This means I keep 1 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 5 of item 4 and 3 of item 5. The offer is [0, 0, 3, 0, 0]. My value would be: 73 + 0 + 0 + 45 + 159 = 277.\n\n   - I will propose the offer [0, 0, 3, 0, 0].\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - The current offer is not acceptable.\n   - My counteroffer [0, 0, 3, 0, 0] gives me a value of 277, which is better than my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 3, 0, 0]}\n```",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 499. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 499. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 654 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 5, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    28 x 0 + 57 x 0 + 3 x 0 + 54 x 5 + 76 x 3\n    which is 498 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 499. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 3, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 3, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 3, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step to determine the optimal action in this round.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value: 499\n   - My values for the items: item 1: 28, item 2: 57, item 3: 3, item 4: 54, item 5: 76\n   - Total items: item 1: 1, item 2: 0, item 3: 3, item 4: 5, item 5: 3\n   - Discount factor: 0.98. This means an offer accepted next round is worth 0.98 times its current value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of the current offer:**\n   - Current offer: [0, 0, 3, 0, 0] (meaning I receive 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 0 of item 4, and 0 of item 5)\n   - Value of current offer to me: (0 * 28) + (0 * 57) + (3 * 3) + (0 * 54) + (0 * 76) = 0 + 0 + 9 + 0 + 0 = 9\n\n3) **Compare to Outside Offer:**\n   - Accepting the current offer yields a value of 9.\n   - My outside offer is 499.\n   - Clearly, accepting the current offer is much worse than walking away.\n\n4) **Consider a Counteroffer:**\n\nI need to determine a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 499. The total value of all items is (1 * 28) + (0 * 57) + (3 * 3) + (5 * 54) + (3 * 76) = 28 + 0 + 9 + 270 + 228 = 535\n\nLet's try to keep all items: giving the other player [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], which means my value would be 535.\nLet's try offering one unit of Item 5 which I value highest per unit.\nIf I give the other player 1 unit of item 5, the counteroffer will be [0, 0, 0, 0, 1] .\nThe value to me would then be (1 * 28) + (0 * 57) + (3 * 3) + (5 * 54) + (2 * 76) = 28 + 0 + 9 + 270 + 152 = 459.\n\nLet's try offering one unit of Item 4 and one unit of item 5: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]\nThe value to me would then be (1 * 28) + (0 * 57) + (3 * 3) + (4 * 54) + (2 * 76) = 28 + 0 + 9 + 216 + 152 = 405.\n\nLet's try offering one unit of item 1, two units of item 3, two units of item 4, and one unit of item 5. The counteroffer is [1, 0, 2, 2, 1]\nThe value to me would then be (0 * 28) + (0 * 57) + (1 * 3) + (3 * 54) + (2 * 76) = 0 + 0 + 3 + 162 + 152 = 317.\n\nLet's try offering zero of everything except offering all of item 4: [0, 0, 0, 5, 0].\nThe value to me would then be (1 * 28) + (0 * 57) + (3 * 3) + (0 * 54) + (3 * 76) = 28 + 0 + 9 + 0 + 228 = 265.\n\nI need to keep more value.\n\nLet's make a more aggressive counteroffer. I will offer [0, 0, 1, 1, 1] to player 2, which means I keep [1, 0, 2, 4, 2].\nMy value is (1 * 28) + (0 * 57) + (2 * 3) + (4 * 54) + (2 * 76) = 28 + 0 + 6 + 216 + 152 = 402.\n\nThis is still low compared to my outside offer. Let's try again.\nI will offer [0, 0, 1, 0, 0] to player 2, which means I keep [1, 0, 2, 5, 3].\nMy value is (1 * 28) + (0 * 57) + (2 * 3) + (5 * 54) + (3 * 76) = 28 + 0 + 6 + 270 + 228 = 532.\n\n5) **Decision:**\nSince my value of 532 is higher than my outside offer of 499, and it's round 2, I should make this counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]}\n```",

This means I get 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5. So, I would keep [1, 0, 2, 5, 3].

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

This means that accepting an offer in a later round is slightly less valuable than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   Since there is no current offer, there is nothing to accept.\n*   I need to formulate an initial offer that is beneficial to me.\n\n3) **Initial Counteroffer Strategy:**\n\nI want to find a counteroffer that is likely to be accepted by Player 2, but also gives me a value greater than my outside option. A reasonable starting point is to offer Player 2 a split that gives us both roughly similar value. However, since I don't know Player 2's values, I'll start with a slightly more conservative offer to myself to ensure I exceed my outside option.\n\nI will try to keep: 2 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5.\nValue = 2 * 79 + 0 * 7 + 2 * 89 + 2 * 14 + 3 * 49 = 158 + 0 + 178 + 28 + 147 = 511\nThis value is less than my outside option of 896. I need to offer less to Player 2.\n\nNow let's try keeping: 3 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5.\nValue = 3 * 79 + 1 * 7 + 2 * 89 + 3 * 14 + 4 * 49 = 237 + 7 + 178 + 42 + 196 = 660\nThis is still much less than my outside option.\n\nLet's try keeping: 3 units of item 1, 0 unit of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5.\nValue = 3 * 79 + 0 * 7 + 3 * 89 + 3 * 14 + 5 * 49 = 237 + 0 + 267 + 42 + 245 = 791\nStill too low.\n\nLet's try keeping: 4 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5.\nValue = 4 * 79 + 0 * 7 + 3 * 89 + 4 * 14 + 6 * 49 = 316 + 0 + 267 + 56 + 294 = 933\n\nThis offer means that I would offer the other player: 0 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 unit of item 3, 0 unit of item 4, 0 units of item 5.\n\nBased on this analysis, my best option is to make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

This means that waiting for a future round reduces the value of any deal by a factor of 0.98.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer: Player 1 offers me [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]. This means I get 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 645. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 909 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 0, 1, 4, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    99 x 3 + 52 x 0 + 45 x 1 + 65 x 4 + 42 x 1\n    which is 644 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 645. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    29 x 1 + 71 x 0 + 34 x 0 + 3 x 0 + 18 x 0\n    which is 29 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 30. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 3, 4, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 3, 4, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the current situation and determine the best action.\n\n1.  **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n    *   My outside offer value: 30\n    *   Item values: item 1 = 29, item 2 = 71, item 3 = 34, item 4 = 3, item 5 = 18\n    *   Total items: 3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 8 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5\n    *   Discount factor: gamma = 0.98. This means that accepting an offer in a later round is slightly less valuable than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2.  **Assess the value of the current offer:**\n\n    *   Current offer: [1, 1, 3, 4, 1] (This is what Player 1 is offering me)\n    *   Calculate the value of the current offer:\n        *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 29 = 29\n        *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 71 = 71\n        *   3 units of item 3: 3 * 34 = 102\n        *   4 units of item 4: 4 * 3 = 12\n        *   1 unit of item 5: 1 * 18 = 18\n        *   Total value: 29 + 71 + 102 + 12 + 18 = 232\n\n    *   Comparison to outside offer: 232 > 30. Accepting the current offer is significantly better than walking away.\n\n3.  **Consider a counteroffer:**\n    Before making a counteroffer, I need to evaluate if it's worth the risk, considering the discount factor and the possibility of Player 1 walking away. The current offer is already quite good (232). Trying to squeeze more out of Player 1 might not be worth it. Let's look at my current offer. Player 1 offered me [1, 1, 3, 4, 1]. This means Player 1 keeps [3-1, 2-1, 6-3, 8-4, 2-1] = [2, 1, 3, 4, 1]. Lets consider giving Player 1 1 of each item, so the offer to them would be [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], meaning I keep [2, 1, 5, 7, 1].\n    Value for me:\n    *   2 * 29 + 1 * 71 + 5 * 34 + 7 * 3 + 1 * 18 = 58 + 71 + 170 + 21 + 18 = 338.\n    This is better than the current offer. So to get this value, the offer to Player 1 would be [1, 1, 1, 1, 1].\n\n4. **Make a decision:**\n\n    *   The current offer is much better than my outside offer.\n    *   Since my initial offer is quite profitable, I'll test a counteroffer to maximize my value.\n    *   I will make a counteroffer to player 1.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 488. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 606 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items.

This means I need to offer the other player items worth 493-35 = 458 to me.\n\n      For example, if I keep only 1 item 2 and nothing else, I get a value of 71 > 30 so that is better than my outside option. The allocation to Player 1 would be [3, 1, 6, 8, 2]. The items I keep would be:\n       - 0 units of item 1\n       - 1 unit of item 2\n       - 0 units of item 3\n       - 0 units of item 4\n       - 0 units of item 5\n      My value for this would be 71. Which is better than the current offer and my outside offer. Now, let's examine the other player's incentives.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - The current offer of [0, 1, 3, 4, 1] is worth 203 to me, which is much better than my outside option of 30.\n   - Since it's round 2, I want to be strategic. I will propose a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer.\n\nSince the current offer is good, I will accept it.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 4, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    65 x 0 + 32 x 0 + 43 x 4 + 30 x 0 + 73 x 0\n    which is 172 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 173. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 2, 4, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Current Situation:**\n\n*   **Outside Offer Value:** 173\n*   **Item Values:** Item 1: 65, Item 2: 32, Item 3: 43, Item 4: 30, Item 5: 73\n*   **Total Items:** 2 units of Item 1, 1 unit of Item 2, 4 units of Item 3, 4 units of Item 4, 1 unit of Item 5.\n*   **Discount Factor:** 0.98.  This means that accepting an offer in a later round is slightly less valuable than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** I am being offered [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]. This means:\n    *   0 units of Item 1: 0 * 65 = 0\n    *   0 units of Item 2: 0 * 32 = 0\n    *   1 unit of Item 3: 1 * 43 = 43\n    *   1 unit of Item 4: 1 * 30 = 30\n    *   0 units of Item 5: 0 * 73 = 0\n    *   Total Value of Current Offer: 43 + 30 = 73\n\n*   **Comparison to Outside Offer:** The current offer (73) is much less than my outside offer (173).  Therefore, accepting this offer would be a mistake.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I want to construct a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer for me. I currently have:\n    * Item 1: 2\n    * Item 2: 1\n    * Item 3: 4\n    * Item 4: 4\n    * Item 5: 1\n    Let's consider giving the other player the following items:\n    * Item 1: 1\n    * Item 2: 0\n    * Item 3: 2\n    * Item 4: 2\n    * Item 5: 0\n\n    That would leave me with:\n    * Item 1: 1 * 65 = 65\n    * Item 2: 1 * 32 = 32\n    * Item 3: 2 * 43 = 86\n    * Item 4: 2 * 30 = 60\n    * Item 5: 1 * 73 = 73\n    * Total Value: 65 + 32 + 86 + 60 + 73 = 316\n\n    Okay.

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 485. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 485. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 804 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 4, 3, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    97 x 1 + 42 x 0 + 60 x 4 + 39 x 3 + 30 x 1\n    which is 484 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 485. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value: 485\n   - My values for items: Item 1: 97, Item 2: 42, Item 3: 60, Item 4: 39, Item 5: 30\n   - Total items: 2 units of Item 1, 1 unit of Item 2, 4 units of Item 3, 4 units of Item 4, 1 unit of Item 5\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.98. This means an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.98 times its value, and in round 3 it's worth 0.98^2 times its value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 0, 2, 3, 0]. This means I get:\n      - 0 units of item 1\n      - 0 units of item 2\n      - 2 units of item 3\n      - 3 units of item 4\n      - 0 units of item 5\n      - My value: (0 * 97) + (0 * 42) + (2 * 60) + (3 * 39) + (0 * 30) = 0 + 0 + 120 + 117 + 0 = 237.\n      Since it is round 2, the value of this offer is 237 * 0.98 = 232.26.\n      This is much less than my outside offer of 485.\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what divisions would be better than my outside offer. I currently have: 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5\n\n   Let's try to construct an offer that is better than 485. I can give them a little more on Item 3 & 4. How about this: I offer Player 1 [0, 0, 3, 3, 0], which would leave me with [2, 1, 1, 1, 1]. My value would be: (2 * 97) + (1 * 42) + (1 * 60) + (1 * 39) + (1 * 30) = 194 + 42 + 60 + 39 + 30 = 365.\n      Since it is round 2, the value of this offer is 365 * 0.98 = 357.7. This is still much less than my outside offer of 485.\n\n   Let's try an offer where I get at least one item 1 and one item 3. I offer Player 1 [1, 1, 3, 4, 1], which would leave me with [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]. My value would be: (1 * 97) + (0 * 42) + (1 * 60) + (0 * 39) + (0 * 30) = 97 + 0 + 60 + 0 + 0 = 157.\n      Since it is round 2, the value of this offer is 157 * 0.98 = 153.86. This is way less than my outside offer of 485.\n\n   I should demand more. If I offered player 1 [0, 0, 1, 1, 0], then I would get [2, 1, 3, 3, 1] and my value is (2*97) + (1*42) + (3*60) + (3*39) + (1*30) = 194+42+180+117+30 = 563.\n   The discounted value is 563*0.98 = 551.74, which is greater than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - The current offer is worse than my outside offer.\n   - Walking away guarantees 485.\n   - Offering Player 1 [0, 0, 1, 1, 0] would leave me with a discounted value of 551.74, which is better than my outside offer.\n\nTherefore, I will make the counteroffer [0, 0, 1, 1, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]}\n```",

                    "prompt": "\n    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\n    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\n    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\n    There are 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\n    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\n    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 101.\n    Your private values are 60 for item 1, 24 for item 2, 89 for item 3, 3 for item 4, 74 for item 5.\n    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to your total value of all items, which is 625. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 422. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 422. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 750 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 3, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    60 x 0 + 24 x 0 + 89 x 3 + 3 x 2 + 74 x 2\n    which is 421 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 422. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step to determine the best action for round 1.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 422\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 60, Item 2: 24, Item 3: 89, Item 4: 3, Item 5: 74\n*   **Total item pool:** 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.98. This means that waiting for a later round reduces the value of the outcome by a factor of 0.98 per round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer. I need to make the first offer.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find an offer that is better than my outside offer of 422. Let's consider a few examples:\n\n    *   **Scenario 1: Keeping most of the valuable items.** Let's say I offer Player 2: 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5.\n        *   My value: (2\\*60) + (3\\*24) + (3\\*89) + (3\\*3) + (2\\*74) = 120 + 72 + 267 + 9 + 148 = 616.  This is much higher than my outside offer, so this is promising. The offer to Player 2 would be [0, 0, 0, 3, 0].\n    *   **Scenario 2: Giving away more items.** Let's say I offer Player 2: 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5.\n        *   I keep: 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5.\n        *   My value: (1\\*60) + (2\\*24) + (2\\*89) + (3\\*3) + (1\\*74) = 60 + 48 + 178 + 9 + 74 = 369.  This is less than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   I need to make an offer that is better than my outside offer of 422.\n*   The discount factor is relatively small in the first round, so there isn't too much pressure to accept a suboptimal offer.\n*   I want to start with an offer that gives me a good value but also leaves room for negotiation. Offering [0, 0, 0, 3, 0] is great for me, so it might not be accepted.\n    * Let's test [0, 1, 0, 3, 0]. Then my value will be (2\\*60) + (2\\*24) + (3\\*89) + (3\\*3) + (2\\*74) = 120 + 48 + 267 + 9 + 148 = 592 which is also great.\n    * Let's test [0, 1, 1, 3, 0]. Then my value will be (2\\*60) + (2\\*24) + (2\\*89) + (3\\*3) + (2\\*74) = 120 + 48 + 178 + 9 + 148 = 503 which is still great.\n    * Let's test [0, 1, 1, 3, 1]. Then my value will be (2\\*60) + (2\\*24) + (2\\*89) + (3\\*3) + (1\\*74) = 120 + 48 + 178 + 9 + 74 = 429 which is just barely above my outside offer.\n    * I'm confident that [0, 1, 1, 3, 1] would result in a higher return for Player 2 than [0, 0, 0, 3, 0] without significantly lowering my score. So I will start with that.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 1, 3, 1]}\n```",

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 1, 3, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 1, 3, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Accepting would be a good move.\n\n   Alternatively, I could counteroffer. Player 1 initially offered [0, 1, 1, 3, 1]. Let me think about a possible counteroffer.\n   If I offer player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], I keep:\n   - 2 units of item 1 = 2 * 29 = 58\n   - 3 units of item 2 = 3 * 47 = 141\n   - 3 units of item 3 = 3 * 16 = 48\n   - 6 units of item 4 = 6 * 88 = 528\n   - 2 units of item 5 = 2 * 41 = 82\n   - Total value = 58 + 141 + 48 + 528 + 82 = 857. This is way better than my outside option.\n\n    I can make an offer that gives some items to Player 1. For example, If I offer [1, 1, 1, 3, 1], I keep:\n   - 1 units of item 1 = 1 * 29 = 29\n   - 2 units of item 2 = 2 * 47 = 94\n   - 2 units of item 3 = 2 * 16 = 32\n   - 3 units of item 4 = 3 * 88 = 264\n   - 1 units of item 5 = 1 * 41 = 41\n   - Total value = 29 + 94 + 32 + 264 + 41 = 460. This is still better than the current offer and my outside offer.\n\n   Since the current offer is already very good for me, I will accept it.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 4, 1, 3, 8] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    61 x 2 + 7 x 4 + 56 x 1 + 35 x 3 + 45 x 8\n    which is 671 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 672. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value: 672\n   - My item values: item 1: 61, item 2: 7, item 3: 56, item 4: 35, item 5: 45\n   - Total items: item 1: 2, item 2: 5, item 3: 1, item 4: 3, item 5: 10\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.98. This means that offers in later rounds are worth slightly less.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer: None. So, accepting is worth 0.\n   - Potential counteroffers: I need to find an offer that gives me more than 672.\n\n3) **Making an Initial Offer:** Since I have to make the first offer, I need to decide how many of each item to offer Player 2. To avoid Mistake 3 (offering nothing or everything), I'll start with a reasonable offer. I need to keep in mind my outside offer value of 672.\n\nLet's start by offering half the items, and adjust based on value.\n\nOffer: [1, 2, 0, 1, 5] (item 1, item 2, item 3, item 4, item 5)\n\nValue of what I keep:\n- Item 1: (2-1) * 61 = 61\n- Item 2: (5-2) * 7 = 21\n- Item 3: (1-0) * 56 = 56\n- Item 4: (3-1) * 35 = 70\n- Item 5: (10-5) * 45 = 225\nTotal Value = 61 + 21 + 56 + 70 + 225 = 433\n\nThis is far below my outside offer value of 672. I need to keep more valuable items to myself and/or offer fewer items to Player 2. Let's reduce the amount of items I am giving to player 2 in items 1, 3, and 5.\n\nOffer: [0, 2, 0, 1, 3]\n\nValue of what I keep:\n- Item 1: (2-0) * 61 = 122\n- Item 2: (5-2) * 7 = 21\n- Item 3: (1-0) * 56 = 56\n- Item 4: (3-1) * 35 = 70\n- Item 5: (10-3) * 45 = 315\nTotal Value = 122 + 21 + 56 + 70 + 315 = 584\n\nStill less than 672, so let's reduce item 4 and 5:\n\nOffer: [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]\n\nValue of what I keep:\n- Item 1: (2-0) * 61 = 122\n- Item 2: (5-2) * 7 = 21\n- Item 3: (1-0) * 56 = 56\n- Item 4: (3-0) * 35 = 105\n- Item 5: (10-2) * 45 = 360\nTotal Value = 122 + 21 + 56 + 105 + 360 = 664\n\nVery close. I will give zero of item 2:\nOffer: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2]\n\nValue of what I keep:\n- Item 1: (2-0) * 61 = 122\n- Item 2: (5-0) * 7 = 35\n- Item 3: (1-0) * 56 = 56\n- Item 4: (3-0) * 35 = 105\n- Item 5: (10-2) * 45 = 360\nTotal Value = 122 + 35 + 56 + 105 + 360 = 678\n\nOkay, 678 is greater than my outside offer of 672.

Offering back the original offer would be a Mistake 3 (offering very little) so I should try to offer Player 1 a bit more to see if they'll accept. Offering Player 1 a counter offer of [1, 2, 0, 1, 5].\n   My value will be:\n      1 * 41 + 3 * 70 + 1 * 24 + 2 * 54 + 5 * 38 = 41 + 210 + 24 + 108 + 190 = 573\n   My value is clearly much greater than my outside offer, so this seems to be a good offer for both parties.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 0, 1, 5]}\n```",

This means I would get:\n    *   Item 1: 1 unit * 61 = 61\n    *   Item 2: 2 units * 7 = 14\n    *   Item 3: 0 units * 56 = 0\n    *   Item 4: 1 unit * 35 = 35\n    *   Item 5: 5 units * 45 = 225\n    *   Total value of current offer = 61 + 14 + 0 + 35 + 225 = 335\n\nSince this is round 2, we multiply the total value by 0.98^(2-1) = 0.98^1 = 0.98.\nTherefore, the discounted value of the current offer is 335 * 0.98 = 328.3\n\n3)  **Consider my outside offer:**\nMy outside offer is worth 672.\n\nSince I want to maximize my value and the value of the current offer (328.3) is much less than my outside offer value of 672, accepting the offer would be a mistake.\n\nTherefore, my best option is to make a counteroffer that is at least equal to my outside offer value.\n\n**Counteroffer:**\n\nI need to figure out a counteroffer that yields a value greater than 672. I will aim to get the items with the highest value to me, which are item 1 (61), item 3 (56), and item 5 (45). Let's try keeping all of item 1, item 3, item 4, and item 5, and giving only item 2 to Player 2. This would mean offering [0, 5, 0, 0, 0] to the other player.\n\n*   Item 1: 2 units * 61 = 122\n*   Item 2: 0 units * 7 = 0\n*   Item 3: 1 unit * 56 = 56\n*   Item 4: 3 units * 35 = 105\n*   Item 5: 10 units * 45 = 450\n    *   Total value of this counteroffer = 122 + 0 + 56 + 105 + 450 = 733\n\nSince this is round 2, we multiply the total value by 0.98^(2-1) = 0.98^1 = 0.98.\nTherefore, the discounted value of the counteroffer is 733 * 0.98 = 718.34\n\nThis counteroffer results in a value of 718.34, which is greater than my outside option of 672.\n\nTherefore, I will make this counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 5, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 191. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 681 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    41 x 0 + 70 x 0 + 24 x 0 + 54 x 0 + 38 x 5\n    which is 190 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 191. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 2, 0, 1, 5]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step to determine the optimal action.\n\n1.  **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n    *   My outside offer value: 191\n    *   My values per item: item 1: 41, item 2: 70, item 3: 24, item 4: 54, item 5: 38\n    *   Total items: item 1: 2, item 2: 5, item 3: 1, item 4: 3, item 5: 10\n    *   Discount factor: gamma = 0.98.  This means accepting an offer in a later round is slightly less valuable than accepting it now.\n\n2.  **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n    *   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 5, 0, 0, 0].  This means I get 0 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5. Player 1 is keeping the rest.  My value if I accept: (0 * 41) + (5 * 70) + (0 * 24) + (0 * 54) + (0 * 38) = 350. Since this is greater than my outside offer of 191, accepting the offer is better than walking away *right now*.\n\n    *   **Previous Round Offer**: Player 1 wanted [0,0,0,0,2]. I countered with offering [1,2,0,1,5] to Player 1. This means I would get 1 unit of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 2 unit of item 4, 5 units of item 5. Value of offer: 41*1 + 70*3 + 24*1 + 54*2 + 38*5 = 41 + 210 + 24 + 108 + 190 = 573.\n    *   **Potential Counteroffers:**\n        *   We have the following number of units remaining: item 1: 2, item 2: 5, item 3: 1, item 4: 3, item 5: 10\n        *   A better offer than previous one must yield a value for myself greater than 350.\n\n            *   Let's try to give Player 1 one unit of item 1, 0 unit of item 2, 0 unit of item 3, 0 unit of item 4, and 0 unit of item 5. This would mean that I get 1 unit of item 1, 5 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 3 unit of item 4, and 10 unit of item 5. Value of offer = 41*1 + 70*5 + 24*1 + 54*3 + 38*10 = 41 + 350 + 24 + 162 + 380 = 957. This would be a good counteroffer.\n            *   Let's try to give Player 1 zero unit of item 1, 0 unit of item 2, 0 unit of item 3, 0 unit of item 4, and 2 unit of item 5. This would mean that I get 2 unit of item 1, 5 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 3 unit of item 4, and 8 unit of item 5. Value of offer = 41*2 + 70*5 + 24*1 + 54*3 + 38*8 = 82 + 350 + 24 + 162 + 304 = 922. This would also be a good counteroffer.\n        * I need to consider the discount rate. If I wait, the value of everything is multiplied by 0.98. I'm pretty happy with the current offer since I'll get 350. I'm not sure if the other player will offer me more than that. I'll accept the current offer.\n\n3.  **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n    *   The current offer is significantly better than my outside offer.\n    *   Trying to get a better counteroffer could result in the other player walking away.\n    *   I'm on round 2 of 3. If I make a counteroffer, and player 1 does not accept, I will walk away in the final round.\n\nTherefore, I should accept the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

I will try to construct an offer that I value above 315.\n\nLet's consider an initial offer. I will start by giving away a significant portion of item 4.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 2, 4, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    69 x 1 + 63 x 0 + 36 x 2 + 3 x 4 + 45 x 4\n    which is 333 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 336. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 4, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 4, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",

This means waiting reduces the value by 2% per round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am offered [0, 0, 0, 4, 0]. This means I get 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n    *   My value for this offer: (0 * 69) + (0 * 63) + (0 * 36) + (4 * 3) + (0 * 45) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 12 + 0 = 12.\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (12) is much worse than my outside offer (336).\n\nNow let's consider what a counteroffer might look like. I need to keep enough items to be worth more than 336.\n\nLet's try to keep all of item 1, all of item 3, and all of item 5. This would be:\n\n*   3 units of item 1 = 3 * 69 = 207\n*   3 units of item 3 = 3 * 36 = 108\n*   4 units of item 5 = 4 * 45 = 180\n\nTotal value = 207 + 108 + 180 = 495\n\nThis is greater than 336. So, offering everything of item 4 to the other player would yield to me 495.\nHowever, the other player might not accept this.\n\nLet's try to find a split where I offer 1 unit of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 4 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5 to player 1. Then I keep 2 unit of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\nThen the value to me would be:\n2*69 + 0*63 + 2*36 + 3*3 + 3*45 = 138 + 0 + 72 + 9 + 135 = 354\nThis is better than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer is terrible (12 << 336).\n*   I can make a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer.\n*   I will propose the counteroffer [1, 0, 1, 4, 1]\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 4, 1]}\n```",

This incentivizes reaching an agreement sooner rather than later, but the effect is small.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - There is currently no offer on the table.\n   - I need to formulate an initial offer, considering my outside offer.\n   - I want to maximize my value while making a reasonable offer to Player 2.\n   - Since it's the first round, and I have no information about Player 2's values, a somewhat even split might be a good starting point, adjusted to my values.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - I will propose a counteroffer.\n   - To avoid mistakes, I need to ensure my kept items' value is greater than my outside offer.\n   - I will consider giving roughly half of each item to the other player, adjusting for item value and the number of units available.\n\nLet's calculate a possible offer:\n*   **Item 1 (7 units):** Offer 3 to Player 2, keep 4.  Value = 4 * 73 = 292\n*   **Item 2 (4 units):** Offer 2 to Player 2, keep 2.  Value = 2 * 29 = 58\n*   **Item 3 (5 units):** Offer 2 to Player 2, keep 3.  Value = 3 * 32 = 96\n*   **Item 4 (5 units):** Offer 2 to Player 2, keep 3.  Value = 3 * 57 = 171\n*   **Item 5 (1 unit):** Offer 0 to Player 2, keep 1.  Value = 1 * 9 = 9\n\nTotal value = 292 + 58 + 96 + 171 + 9 = 626\n\nThis offer seems reasonable, as the total value is much higher than my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 2, 2, 2, 0]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1138. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1071 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [6, 3, 5, 3, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    100 x 6 + 80 x 3 + 24 x 5 + 59 x 3 + 94 x 0\n    which is 1137 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1138. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 2, 2, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 2, 2, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the current situation.\n\n1) **Current Situation Analysis:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 1138\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 100, Item 2: 80, Item 3: 24, Item 4: 59, Item 5: 94\n*   **Total items:** Item 1: 7, Item 2: 4, Item 3: 5, Item 4: 5, Item 5: 1\n*   **Discount factor:** 0.98. This means accepting later is slightly less valuable than accepting now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [3, 2, 2, 2, 0].\n    This means I get:\n    *   Item 1: 3 units\n    *   Item 2: 2 units\n    *   Item 3: 2 units\n    *   Item 4: 2 units\n    *   Item 5: 0 units\n\n    My value for the current offer is: (3 * 100) + (2 * 80) + (2 * 24) + (2 * 59) + (0 * 94) = 300 + 160 + 48 + 118 + 0 = 626\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** 626 is less than my outside offer of 1138. Accepting this offer would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find an offer that gives me a value greater than 1138. Let's see what it means to give away nothing:\n\n    *   I keep: Item 1: 7, Item 2: 4, Item 3: 5, Item 4: 5, Item 5: 1\n    *   My value: (7 * 100) + (4 * 80) + (5 * 24) + (5 * 59) + (1 * 94) = 700 + 320 + 120 + 295 + 94 = 1529\n    *   This is significantly more than my outside offer.\n\n    I need to give Player 1 enough to make it worthwhile for them to accept, but still keep at least 1138 in value for myself.\n\n    Let's propose keeping [4, 2, 3, 3, 1] for myself, and offering the rest: [3, 2, 2, 2, 0] to player 1 (same as current offer).\n    * My value: 4 * 100 + 2 * 80 + 3 * 24 + 3 * 59 + 1 * 94 = 400 + 160 + 72 + 177 + 94 = 903. Still less than my outside offer of 1138.\n\n    Let's propose keeping [5, 3, 4, 4, 1] for myself and offering the rest [2, 1, 1, 1, 0] to player 1\n    * My value: 5 * 100 + 3 * 80 + 4 * 24 + 4 * 59 + 1 * 94 = 500 + 240 + 96 + 236 + 94 = 1166\n\n    This gives me 1166, which is greater than 1138! This means that if they accepted, it would be better than walking away.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\nSince the current offer is worse than my outside offer, I should not accept. I also should not walk away, as I can make a counteroffer that yields a better outcome. I will propose the counteroffer [2, 1, 1, 1, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 1, 1, 0]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [6, 3, 5, 3, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    100 x 6 + 80 x 3 + 24 x 5 + 59 x 3 + 94 x 0\n    which is 1137 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1138. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 2, 2, 2, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 1, 1, 1, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [3, 2, 2, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 2, 2, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value: 1138\n   - My item values: item 1: 100, item 2: 80, item 3: 24, item 4: 59, item 5: 94\n   - Total items: 7 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.98. This means waiting another round reduces the value of a deal by 2%.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer: [3, 2, 2, 2, 0] (what is offered to me)\n      - This means I keep: [7-3, 4-2, 5-2, 5-2, 1-0] = [4, 2, 3, 3, 1]\n      - Value of current offer to me: (4 * 100) + (2 * 80) + (3 * 24) + (3 * 59) + (1 * 94) = 400 + 160 + 72 + 177 + 94 = 903\n      - Since 903 is less than my outside offer of 1138, accepting this offer would be a mistake.\n\n   - Potential counteroffers: I need to find an offer that gives me a value greater than 1138. Let's start by considering giving away relatively little and iterating.\n\n3) **Possible Counteroffer Strategy:**\n   Since my outside offer is 1138, I need to keep enough items to exceed this value. Let's try an offer where I keep a majority of the high-value items:\n\n   - Let's say I offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Then I keep all items: [7, 4, 5, 5, 1]. My value would be: (7 * 100) + (4 * 80) + (5 * 24) + (5 * 59) + (1 * 94) = 700 + 320 + 120 + 295 + 94 = 1529. This is greater than 1138.\n   -  However, offering nothing is a bad strategy and the other player will not accept.\n\n   - Let's consider an offer where I give away 1 unit of item 1: I offer [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Then I keep [6, 4, 5, 5, 1]. My value would be: (6 * 100) + (4 * 80) + (5 * 24) + (5 * 59) + (1 * 94) = 600 + 320 + 120 + 295 + 94 = 1429. This is still greater than my outside offer.\n   \n   - Let's consider an offer where I give away 2 unit of item 1: I offer [2, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Then I keep [5, 4, 5, 5, 1]. My value would be: (5 * 100) + (4 * 80) + (5 * 24) + (5 * 59) + (1 * 94) = 500 + 320 + 120 + 295 + 94 = 1329. This is still greater than my outside offer.\n\n   - Let's consider an offer where I give away 3 unit of item 1: I offer [3, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Then I keep [4, 4, 5, 5, 1]. My value would be: (4 * 100) + (4 * 80) + (5 * 24) + (5 * 59) + (1 * 94) = 400 + 320 + 120 + 295 + 94 = 1229. This is still greater than my outside offer.\n\n   - Let's consider an offer where I give away 4 unit of item 1: I offer [4, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Then I keep [3, 4, 5, 5, 1]. My value would be: (3 * 100) + (4 * 80) + (5 * 24) + (5 * 59) + (1 * 94) = 300 + 320 + 120 + 295 + 94 = 1129. This is less than my outside offer.\n\n   Let's offer [3, 1, 1, 1, 0]. I keep [4, 3, 4, 4, 1]. The value is (4*100) + (3*80) + (4*24) + (4*59) + (1*94) = 400 + 240 + 96 + 236 + 94 = 1066. This is not greater than my outside offer.\n\n   Let's offer [2, 1, 1, 1, 0]. I keep [5, 3, 4, 4, 1]. The value is (5*100) + (3*80) + (4*24) + (4*59) + (1*94) = 500 + 240 + 96 + 236 + 94 = 1166. This is greater than my outside offer.\n\n4) **Decision:**\n   The current offer is not good. Offering [2, 1, 1, 1, 0] yields me a value greater than my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 1, 1, 0]}\n```",

So, accepting is not an option.\n\n*   Potential Counteroffers:  I need to propose an offer that gives Player 2 some items, but leaves me with a value greater than 740.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

This is much lower than my outside offer of 407.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find an offer that gives me a value greater than 407. Let's start by offering player 1 one unit of each item. That leaves me with 4 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 4 of item 4, and 4 of item 5. My value would be:\n    * Item 1: 4 * 94 = 376\n    * Item 2: 3 * 23 = 69\n    * Item 3: 2 * 64 = 128\n    * Item 4: 4 * 22 = 88\n    * Item 5: 4 * 10 = 40\n    * Total value = 376 + 69 + 128 + 88 + 40 = 701\n\n    This is much better than my outside offer.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 3, 5, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    94 x 1 + 23 x 0 + 64 x 3 + 22 x 5 + 10 x 1\n    which is 406 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 407. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 5]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 5]\n\n    What is your action?

I need to make a counteroffer that is better for me than walking away.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 714. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 867 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 4, 4, 1, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    60 x 1 + 16 x 4 + 53 x 4 + 88 x 1 + 72 x 4\n    which is 712 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 714. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 4, 1, 0, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 4, 1, 0, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 714.\n   - My values for the items are: item 1 = 60, item 2 = 16, item 3 = 53, item 4 = 88, item 5 = 72.\n   - The total pool of items is: 3 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 4 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor is 0.98. This means that accepting an offer in a later round is slightly less valuable than accepting it now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** I am being offered [0, 4, 1, 0, 2]. This means I get 0 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5. This leaves Player 1 with [3, 2, 3, 1, 2].\n     - My value for the current offer: (0 * 60) + (4 * 16) + (1 * 53) + (0 * 88) + (2 * 72) = 0 + 64 + 53 + 0 + 144 = 261.\n   - Since 261 is much less than my outside offer of 714, accepting this offer is not a good idea.\n\nNow, let's consider a potential counteroffer. I want to make an offer that is good for me, meaning it's better than my outside offer of 714.\n\nLet's try keeping all items:\n(3 * 60) + (6 * 16) + (4 * 53) + (1 * 88) + (4 * 72) = 180 + 96 + 212 + 88 + 288 = 864.\n\nLet's try offering [0, 2, 0, 0, 0] to Player 1. This means I keep [3, 4, 4, 1, 4].\n(3 * 60) + (4 * 16) + (4 * 53) + (1 * 88) + (4 * 72) = 180 + 64 + 212 + 88 + 288 = 832. This is greater than 714.\n\nLet's try offering [0, 3, 0, 0, 0] to Player 1. This means I keep [3, 3, 4, 1, 4].\n(3 * 60) + (3 * 16) + (4 * 53) + (1 * 88) + (4 * 72) = 180 + 48 + 212 + 88 + 288 = 816. This is greater than 714.\n\nLet's try offering [1, 3, 1, 0, 2] to Player 1. This means I keep [2, 3, 3, 1, 2].\n(2 * 60) + (3 * 16) + (3 * 53) + (1 * 88) + (2 * 72) = 120 + 48 + 159 + 88 + 144 = 559. This is less than 714.\n\nOkay, after several calculations, it is clear that the offer needs to be carefully crafted to be better than 714. I will start with an offer that biases towards me, and see if Player 1 will work with me.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - I should not accept the current offer.\n   - I should not walk away.\n   - I should propose a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 4, 4, 1, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    60 x 1 + 16 x 4 + 53 x 4 + 88 x 1 + 72 x 4\n    which is 712 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 714. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 4, 1, 0, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 3, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 6, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 6, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and decide on the best action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value: 714\n   - My values for the items: item 1 = 60, item 2 = 16, item 3 = 53, item 4 = 88, item 5 = 72\n   - Total items: 3 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 4 units of item 5\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.98. This means accepting an offer in a later round is slightly less valuable than accepting it now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer: [0, 6, 0, 0, 0]. This means Player 1 is offering me 0 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.  My value for this offer is:\n     (0 * 60) + (6 * 16) + (0 * 53) + (0 * 88) + (0 * 72) = 0 + 96 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 96.\n   - This value (96) is significantly less than my outside offer value (714).\n\n3) **Consider potential counteroffers:**\nI need to create a counteroffer that gives Player 1 some items, while ensuring that I retain items worth more than 714. Let's start by calculating the value of keeping all the items for myself.\n(3 * 60) + (6 * 16) + (4 * 53) + (1 * 88) + (4 * 72) = 180 + 96 + 212 + 88 + 288 = 864\n\nI want to find a distribution that I prefer over my outside option, which is worth 714.\n\nLet's try a counteroffer where I give Player 1 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\nMy value: (2 * 60) + (4 * 16) + (3 * 53) + (1 * 88) + (3 * 72) = 120 + 64 + 159 + 88 + 216 = 647\nMy value is still lower than my outside offer, so this is not a good counteroffer.\n\nI will try a different counteroffer. I will offer [0, 3, 1, 0, 1] to the other player:\nMy value: (3 * 60) + (3 * 16) + (3 * 53) + (1 * 88) + (3 * 72) = 180 + 48 + 159 + 88 + 216 = 691\nMy value is still lower than my outside offer, so this is not a good counteroffer.\n\nI need to offer Player 1 less items to increase my value.\n\nI will try to offer: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I will give Player 1 nothing, and keep all items for myself.\nMy value: (3 * 60) + (6 * 16) + (4 * 53) + (1 * 88) + (4 * 72) = 180 + 96 + 212 + 88 + 288 = 864\nMy value is greater than my outside offer value of 714.\n\nNow, the question is if I should offer this counteroffer or walk. Since this is round 2, if I walk, I immediately get my outside offer. If I make a counteroffer and the other player rejects it, then we are at round 3. I'd be making a counteroffer in round 3, which is the same as walking away.\n\nSince I get 864 by keeping everything for myself, which is much better than my outside offer value, I should offer Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This may result in the other player walking away, but if they accept, I get a much better deal than walking away.\n\n4) **Make a decision:**\nSince 96 < 714, accepting is a bad decision.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 3, 3, 3, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    88 x 3 + 29 x 3 + 63 x 3 + 87 x 3 + 50 x 1\n    which is 851 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 853. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 1, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 1, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action.\n\n1. **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n   - My outside offer value: 853\n   - My values for items 1-5: 88, 29, 63, 87, 50\n   - Total items: 3 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 3 of item 4, 3 of item 5\n   - Discount factor: 0.98. This means that accepting a slightly worse offer now is better than getting a potentially better offer later, if the difference isn't too big.\n\n2. **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer:** I am being offered [0, 1, 1, 0, 0].  This means I would receive:\n      - 0 of item 1: 0 * 88 = 0\n      - 1 of item 2: 1 * 29 = 29\n      - 1 of item 3: 1 * 63 = 63\n      - 0 of item 4: 0 * 87 = 0\n      - 0 of item 5: 0 * 50 = 0\n      Total value = 0 + 29 + 63 + 0 + 0 = 92\n\n      My outside offer is 853, so accepting the current offer would be Mistake 4 (Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer).\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** I need to construct an offer that leaves me with a value greater than 853. Let's consider keeping all of items 1, 4, and 5, and splitting items 2 and 3.

This is less than my outside offer, so this is Mistake 2.\n      - Offer Player 1 [0, 3, 3, 0, 0]:\n          - I keep [3, 1, 1, 3, 3]: 3*88 + 1*29 + 1*63 + 3*87 + 3*50 = 264 + 29 + 63 + 261 + 150 = 767.  This is less than my outside offer, so this is Mistake 2.\n      - Offer Player 1 [0, 2, 2, 0, 0]:\n          - I keep [3, 2, 2, 3, 3]: 3*88 + 2*29 + 2*63 + 3*87 + 3*50 = 264 + 58 + 126 + 261 + 150 = 859. This is greater than my outside offer.\n\n3. **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   - The current offer is terrible.\n   - A counteroffer of [0, 2, 2, 0, 0] would leave me with a value of 859, which is slightly better than my outside offer.\n\nTherefore, I should make the counteroffer [0, 2, 2, 0, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 2, 0, 0]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 3, 3, 3, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    88 x 3 + 29 x 3 + 63 x 3 + 87 x 3 + 50 x 1\n    which is 851 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 853. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 2, 2, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 1, 3, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 1, 3, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\n1) **Current Situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 853\n*   My item values: item 1 = 88, item 2 = 29, item 3 = 63, item 4 = 87, item 5 = 50\n*   Total items: item 1 = 3, item 2 = 4, item 3 = 4, item 4 = 3, item 5 = 3\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.98. This means accepting an offer in round 2 gives me 0.98 times the value of that offer.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 1, 1, 3, 0]. This means I would receive:\n    *   0 units of item 1\n    *   1 unit of item 2\n    *   1 unit of item 3\n    *   3 units of item 4\n    *   0 units of item 5\n\n    My value for this offer is: (0 * 88) + (1 * 29) + (1 * 63) + (3 * 87) + (0 * 50) = 0 + 29 + 63 + 261 + 0 = 353.\n\n    Since this is round 2, the discounted value is 353 * 0.98 = 345.94. This is significantly lower than my outside offer of 853.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to find an offer that gives me a value greater than 853 / 0.98 = 870.41 to make it worth it. Let's consider an offer where I give away a small amount and keep most of the valuable items. For example, I could offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. That leaves me with:\n    *   3 units of item 1\n    *   4 units of item 2\n    *   4 units of item 3\n    *   3 units of item 4\n    *   3 units of item 5\n\n    My value for this is (3 * 88) + (4 * 29) + (4 * 63) + (3 * 87) + (3 * 50) = 264 + 116 + 252 + 261 + 150 = 1043. Which is greater than 870.41. So this counteroffer is much better than walking away.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\nThe current offer is very bad. Since 1043 > 870.41, I will make a counteroffer to get all the items and see what player 1 does.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

Since it's round 3, the discount factor is 0.98^(3-1) = 0.98^2 = 0.9604.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers [0, 2, 2, 0, 0]. This means I receive 0 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5. This leaves me with [3, 2, 2, 3, 3]. My value is:\n    (3 * 88) + (2 * 29) + (2 * 63) + (3 * 87) + (3 * 50) = 264 + 58 + 126 + 261 + 150 = 859.\n    Considering the discount factor: 859 * 0.9604 = 824.9036\n\n*   **Compare to outside offer:** The discounted value of accepting the current offer (824.9036) is less than my outside offer (853).\n\nSince this is the last round, if I make a counteroffer, it will be treated as a walk. Therefore, my decision comes down to accepting the current offer or walking away. Since the current offer's discounted value is less than my outside option, I should walk away.\n\n**Decision:**\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 454. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 454. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 429 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 4, 0, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    14 x 3 + 78 x 4 + 2 x 0 + 45 x 2 + 4 x 2\n    which is 452 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 454. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

This means that offers in later rounds are worth slightly less. Since it's round 1, the discount factor doesn't strongly influence the initial offer strategy, but it's important to keep in mind for future rounds.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**  I need to determine a counteroffer that maximizes my value while also being potentially acceptable to Player 2.

This is too low.\n\nI think I will go for giving away 1 unit of Item 2 and Item 4, as these have the highest value to me.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   I will propose a counteroffer that gives Player 2 1 unit of item 2 and 1 unit of item 4.\n\n4 * 14 + 3 * 78 + 4 * 2 + 1 * 45 + 3 * 4 = 56 + 234 + 8 + 45 + 12 = 355.

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 454. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 454. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 429 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 4, 0, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    14 x 3 + 78 x 4 + 2 x 0 + 45 x 2 + 4 x 2\n    which is 452 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 454. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 454\n*   **My values of the items:** item 1: 14, item 2: 78, item 3: 2, item 4: 45, item 5: 4\n*   **Total pool of items:** item 1: 4, item 2: 4, item 3: 4, item 4: 2, item 5: 3\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.98\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [1, 1, 1, 1, 1].  This means I would get:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 14 = 14\n    *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 78 = 78\n    *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 2 = 2\n    *   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 45 = 45\n    *   1 unit of item 5: 1 * 4 = 4\n    *   Total value of current offer = 14 + 78 + 2 + 45 + 4 = 143\n\n*   **Keeping the current offer in mind, my value from the current offer is 143. If I accept, my discounted value is 143 * (0.98)^1 = 140.14. This is less than my outside offer of 454.** I will not accept the current offer.\n*   If I walk, I get 454.\n*   Potential Counteroffers.\n\n    **The current offer to me is [1,1,1,1,1]. Thus I give to Player 2 items equal to:**\n     *  Item 1: 4 - 1 = 3\n     *  Item 2: 4 - 1 = 3\n     *  Item 3: 4 - 1 = 3\n     *  Item 4: 2 - 1 = 1\n     *  Item 5: 3 - 1 = 2\n\n    **My counteroffer needs to be better than 454 if accepted this round, or better than 454/0.98 = 463.27 if it's accepted next round.**\n\n    Let's try to figure out a counteroffer that works. It makes sense to keep as many of item 2 (value 78) as possible. And items 1 and 4 are relatively valuable as well.\n    Here's the maximum I can get if I keep all items to myself: 4 * 14 + 4 * 78 + 4 * 2 + 2 * 45 + 3 * 4 = 56 + 312 + 8 + 90 + 12 = 478\n\n    I need to give up some value for Player 2, but it needs to result in an exchange that is beneficial for me. Let's look at the current offer: if I kept everything, I'd have 478. If I accepted this offer, I'd have 143.\n\nLet's evaluate keeping [3,3,3,1,2] for myself:\n3*14 + 3*78 + 3*2 + 1*45 + 2*4 = 42 + 234 + 6 + 45 + 8 = 335. This is bad, so I should counter offer by returning items to the other player so my value becomes higher.\n\nLet's try to improve this, and give player 2 item 3 and 5, since it yields a low value for me:\n[3, 3, 0, 1, 0]\n3*14 + 3*78 + 0*2 + 1*45 + 0*4 = 42 + 234 + 0 + 45 + 0 = 321\n\nLet's try [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] which means I get to keep all the items to myself.\nMy payoff is 478. This is greater than my outside offer.\n\nI will keep [4,4,4,2,3] for myself, and offer [0,0,0,0,0] to the other player.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nI will make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",
