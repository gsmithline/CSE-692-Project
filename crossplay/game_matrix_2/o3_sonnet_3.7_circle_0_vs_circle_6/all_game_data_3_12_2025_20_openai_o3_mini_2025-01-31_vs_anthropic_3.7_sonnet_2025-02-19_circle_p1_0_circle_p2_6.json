                    "response": "Step\u2010by\u2010step reasoning:\n1. We start with a total of 22 units overall (3, 4, 4, 6, 5 for items 1\u20135) and my private per\u2010unit values: 85, 47, 71, 57, 11. My total \u201cif I got everything\u201d is 1124, so my outside option (50) is very low relative to what I can gain in a deal. Player 2\u2019s item\u2010values are unknown, but each value is drawn uniformly from 1 to 101. For an \u201caverage\u201d type, the expected per\u2010unit value is about 51. Thus if Player 2 had all 22 items their expected total would be roughly 1122; however, their private outside offer is drawn uniformly from 1 to their total so its expected value is about half (\u2248561). \n\n2. In negotiating, I want to get as much as possible while giving Player 2 just enough so that, from their (unknown) perspective, the bundle they receive is at least as good as what they might expect if they waited (or \u201cwalked away\u201d). In round 1 there is no discount penalty (gamma^(0)=1) and I have the initiative.\n\n3. To maximize my own value, I try to give away those items that matter least to me. My values rank the items (from least to most \u201cprecious\u201d for me) as: item 5 at 11, then item 2 at 47, then item 4 at 57, then item 3 at 71, and finally item 1 at 85. In a rough \u201caverage\u2010type\u201d scenario, I want to construct a bundle for Player 2 that is around a total of 11 units (since 11\u00d751 approximates 561, matching their average outside option).\n\n4. I can start by giving all 5 units of item 5 (requiring little concession on my part) to secure 5 of those 11 units. Then, to reach 11 total units, I give all 4 units of item 2 (now giving 9 units in total). To achieve the 11 units threshold, I add 2 units of the next \u201ccheaper\u201d item (by my measure), item 4. This yields an offer of 5 (item 5) + 4 (item 2) + 2 (item 4) = 11 total units for Player 2, which on average would be worth about 561 (11\u00d751) to them, roughly matching what they might expect as a reservation value.\n\n5. My proposed offer then is to give Player 2:\n\u2003\u2022 0 units of item 1 (I keep all 3 units)\n\u2003\u2022 4 units of item 2 (all available)\n\u2003\u2022 0 units of item 3 (I keep all 4 units)\n\u2003\u2022 2 units of item 4 (out of 6, leaving 4)\n\u2003\u2022 5 units of item 5 (all available)\n\nThis leaves me with:\n\u2003\u2022 3 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 4 of item 4, and 0 of item 5.\nMy own value from that allocation is 3\u00d785 + 4\u00d771 + 4\u00d757 = 255 + 284 + 228 = 767, a good payoff for me given my strong position relative to my outside option.\n\n6. Since it\u2019s round 1 and I\u2019m the first mover, my action is to propose this offer as a COUNTEROFFER.\n\nThus, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 4, 0, 2, 5]}",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 1186. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1186. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 807 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 4, 1, 6, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    80 x 3 + 34 x 4 + 10 x 1 + 69 x 6 + 76 x 5\n    which is 1180 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1186. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 4, 0, 2, 5]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 4, 0, 2, 5]\n\n    What is your action?

In the current offer I get no item\u00a01. A counterproposal that \u201csqueezes\u201d one unit of item\u00a01 from Player\u00a02 will give me a higher payoff. For example, if I offer Player\u00a02 the bundle [2, 4, 0, 5, 5] then because the total available is [3, 4, 4, 6, 5] my share becomes the complement: \n\n\u2003\u2003[3\u20132, 4\u20134, 4\u20130, 6\u20135, 5\u20135] = [1, 0, 4, 1, 0].\n\nFor me that \u201craw\u201d value is \n\n\u2003\u20031\u00d785 + 0\u00d747 + 4\u00d771 + 1\u00d757 + 0\u00d711 = 85 + 284 + 57 = 426,\n\nand if this agreement happens in round\u00a03 it will be discounted by 0.98^(3\u20131) \u2248 0.9604 \u2013 so an approximate present value of 426\u00d70.9604 \u2248 409. (Even though the deal would occur one round later, this payoff is clearly much higher than the present 334 if I accepted the current offer.)\n\nI expect that Player\u00a02, facing a \u201cfinal\u2010round\u201d decision (where if they try to counter again they\u2019d end up walking away and get only their outside offer) will likely accept a split that in all but the one unit of item\u00a01 is exactly as they had in their own round\u20101 offer. In other words, by offering [2, 4, 0, 5, 5] I leave Player\u00a02 exactly the same on every item except that instead of 3 units of item\u00a01 they\u2019d get 2. Given that Player\u00a02\u2019s private values are uncertain (and by a random draw their \u201ccost\u201d of giving up one unit of item\u00a01 may be lower than expected) I believe this is a reasonable counteroffer that improves my outcome quite a bit while forcing Player\u00a02 to make a \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d decision now rather than risking the discount in a final round.\n\nThus, my action is to COUNTEROFFER with [2, 4, 0, 5, 5].\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 4, 0, 5, 5]}",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 1186. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1186. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 807 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 4, 1, 6, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    80 x 3 + 34 x 4 + 10 x 1 + 69 x 6 + 76 x 5\n    which is 1180 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1186. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 4, 0, 2, 5]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 4, 1, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 4, 0, 5, 5]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 4, 0, 5, 5]\n\n    What is your action?

Let me go through this step by step:\n\n1) Current situation analysis:\n   - My outside offer value is 1186\n   - My values per item: item 1 (80), item 2 (34), item 3 (10), item 4 (69), item 5 (76)\n   - Total items: 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5\n   - We're in round 2, so any deal would be discounted by 0.98 (gamma)\n\n2) Assessing Player 1's current offer to me:\n   Player 1 is offering me: [2, 4, 0, 5, 5]\n   My value calculation:\n   - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 80 = 160\n   - 4 units of item 2 = 4 \u00d7 34 = 136\n   - 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 10 = 0\n   - 5 units of item 4 = 5 \u00d7 69 = 345\n   - 5 units of item 5 = 5 \u00d7 76 = 380\n   Total value = 1021\n   With discount factor (0.98): 1021 \u00d7 0.98 = 1000.58\n\n   This is less than my outside offer of 1186, so I should not accept this offer.\n\n3) Looking at the negotiation history:\n   - I previously offered Player 1 [0, 0, 4, 1, 0], keeping [3, 4, 0, 5, 5] for myself\n   - Player 1 offered [0, 4, 0, 2, 5] first, then [2, 4, 0, 5, 5] now\n   - From these offers, I can infer Player 1 might value item 2 and item 5 less, while valuing items 1, 3, and 4 more\n\n4) Designing a counteroffer:\n   Let me try to keep more of the high-value items (1, 4, 5) while giving away more of the lower-value items (3).\n   \n   If I offer [1, 0, 4, 1, 0], I would keep [2, 4, 0, 5, 5] for myself:\n   - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 80 = 160\n   - 4 units of item 2 = 4 \u00d7 34 = 136\n   - 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 10 = 0\n   - 5 units of item 4 = 5 \u00d7 69 = 345\n   - 5 units of item 5 = 5 \u00d7 76 = 380\n   Total value = 1021\n   With discount: 1021 \u00d7 0.98\u00b2 (assuming deal in round 3) = 980.57\n\n   This is still less than my outside offer, so I need a better counteroffer.\n\n   What if I try [0, 1, 4, 1, 0]?

This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 3, 9, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    8 x 0 + 14 x 1 + 80 x 3 + 99 x 9 + 80 x 5\n    which is 1545 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1546. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

They're also willing to give up 1 unit of item 5.\n\n## 3) Counteroffer Evaluation\n\nI need to make a counteroffer that:\n- Gives me value greater than my outside offer (1546)\n- Is potentially acceptable to Player 1\n- Considers the discount factor\n\nLet me try to keep most of items 3, 4, and 5 which I value highly, while offering more of items 1 and 2.\n\nIf I offer Player 1:\n- 2 units of item 1 (keeping 1): 1 \u00d7 8 = 8\n- 3 units of item 2 (keeping 1): 1 \u00d7 14 = 14\n- 1 unit of item 3 (keeping 6): 6 \u00d7 80 = 480\n- 1 unit of item 4 (keeping 9): 9 \u00d7 99 = 891\n- 0 units of item 5 (keeping 5): 5 \u00d7 80 = 400\n\nTotal value to me: 8 + 14 + 480 + 891 + 400 = 1793\n\nThis is better than my outside offer of 1546.\n\nLet me verify this counteroffer is valid:\n- I'm offering [2, 3, 1, 1, 0]\n- This is within the available units of each item\n- The value to me (1793) exceeds my outside offer (1546)\n- I'm not making any of the five mistakes outlined\n\n## 4) Decision\n\nBased on this analysis, I should make a counteroffer.

The lowest\u2010value item for me is item\u202f4 (worth only 3 per unit), and there are 10 units available. If I concede all 10 units of item\u202f4 to Player\u202f2 the cost for me is 10\u00d73 = 30. (I cannot use my \u201cconcession budget\u201d to give a share from a \u201cmore expensive\u201d item without jeopardizing my own payoff; giving even one unit of, say, item\u202f5 would cost 42 and nearly use up all my slack.) \n\nWhat would be the result if I \u201cgive\u201d Player\u202f2 all of item\u202f4?\n\u2003\u2013 My share then becomes the remaining items:\n\u2003\u2003item\u202f1: 3 \u2013 0 = 3,\n\u2003\u2003item\u202f2: 4 \u2013 0 = 4,\n\u2003\u2003item\u202f3: 7 \u2013 0 = 7,\n\u2003\u2003item\u202f4: 10 \u2013 10 = 0,\n\u2003\u2003item\u202f5: 5 \u2013 0 = 5.\n\u2003\u2013 My total raw value becomes:\n\u2003\u20033\u00d752 + 4\u00d762 + 7\u00d799 + 0\u00d73 + 5\u00d742 = 156 + 248 + 693 + 0 + 210 = 1307.\n\u2003\u2013 Discounted by gamma (0.98) in round\u202f2, I get 1307\u00d70.98 \u2248 1280.9, which is safely above my outside offer of 1267.\n\u2003\nI know that in round 1 Player\u202f2\u2019s action would have led (if implemented) to me receiving only [2,3,1,1,0] (and Player2 the remainder, which in that offer is a much better mix for them). But since that deal would yield me only 384 (discounted) points, I must push for a deal that gives me nearly all the total\u2014but I also need to tempt Player\u202f2 to accept rather than waiting for their (uncertain) outside offer. \n\nGiven my almost \u201call\u2010or\u2010nothing\u201d situation (my reservation is nearly as high as the full total) my best chance is to concede only my \u201ccheap\u201d item type in quantity. Conceding all of item\u202f4 (all 10 units) costs me only 30 from my 1337 and leaves me with 1307 in gross benefit. (I do not have room to concede any other items without dropping below the threshold needed to beat my outside offer.)\n\nThus, my counteroffer is to give Player\u202f2 all 10 units of item\u202f4 and nothing else. In other words, I propose:\n\u2003\u2003Offer to Player\u202f2: [0, 0, 0, 10, 0].\n\nThis counteroffer leaves me with the division [3,4,7,0,5] (since total items are [3,4,7,10,5]). My raw total is 1307, which discounts to about 1280.9\u2014safely above my outside offer value. (I am aware that Player\u202f2\u2019s exact preferences and outside offer are unknown, but given the discounting and my narrow margin for concession, this is the most I can offer while still improving my outcome relative to walking away.)\n\nTherefore, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 10, 0]}",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

                    "response": "I'll first explain my reasoning.\n\nI know that the full \u201cpie\u201d (in my own view) is worth 1000 (computed as 1\u00d781 + 3\u00d711 + 6\u00d791 + 4\u00d741 + 2\u00d788). My private outside option is 559, so if I don\u2019t get a deal I\u2019ll only have 559 guaranteed. That means any deal I propose in round\u202f1 should net me more than 559 for me (after discounting, and since it\u2019s round\u202f1 the discount factor is 1).\n\nI also know that Player\u202f2\u2019s values for each unit are drawn uniformly from 1 to 101, so on average each unit is worth about 51 for them. (For instance, on average the whole pie for them is roughly 16\u00d751 \u2248 816, and so their outside offer \u2013 drawn uniformly up to that total \u2013 averages around 408.) In order for Player\u202f2 to be willing to accept, the offer should give them an expected value at least slightly above what they\u2019d expect from their outside option.\n\nI also observe that I value some items much more than others. My highest unit values are for item\u202f3 (91/unit) and item\u202f5 (88/unit). To protect my high\u2010value items, I want to keep those. The items that cost me less are items with lower unit value, in particular item\u202f2 (11/unit) and item\u202f4 (41/unit). Item\u202f1 (81/unit) is in between; I still prefer to keep my very high\u2013value items, but I can be prepared to concede an item that might provide Player\u202f2 with only an average level (\u224851/unit) of value.\n\nA natural idea is to try to \u201ctrade\u201d by offering Player\u202f2 the items that are less \u201cprecious\u201d to me but \u2013 on average \u2013 worth roughly the amount they\u2019d like to secure above their outside option. One relatively promising division is to let Player\u202f2 have all of items 1, 2, and 4. In that case, under average assumptions their \u201cown value\u201d would be about:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003item\u202f1: \u224851 (1 unit)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003item\u202f2: 3 units \u00d7 \u224851 = 153\n\u2003\u2022\u2003item\u202f4: 4 units \u00d7 \u224851 = 204\nTotaling about 408\u2014right around their expected outside offer value. A deal at par with their disagreement outcome is risky, however; they\u2019d prefer a slight \u201cbonus\u201d above their outside option. To build in that extra incentive, I can also give them 1 unit of one of the remaining items. Between item\u202f3 (91/unit for me) and item\u202f5 (88/unit for me), I choose item\u202f5 since 88 is slightly lower than 91.\n\nThus, if I offer Player\u202f2 the following:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u202f1: 1 unit\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u202f2: 3 units\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u202f3: 0 units\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u202f4: 4 units\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u202f5: 1 unit\nthen Player\u202f2\u2019s expected value (using the average of roughly 51/unit) would be:\n\u200351 (item\u202f1) + 153 (item\u202f2) + 204 (item\u202f4) + 51 (the 1 unit of item\u202f5) = 459,\nwhich is a bit above the estimated 408 from their outside option. Meanwhile, I keep:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u202f3: 6 units = 6\u00d791 = 546,\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u202f5: the other 1 unit = 88,\nfor a total of 634 \u2013 well above my outside option of 559.\n\nI therefore decide that my initial offer will be to offer Player\u202f2 exactly the division [1, 3, 0, 4, 1].\n\nMy final answer is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 3, 0, 4, 1]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    20 x 0 + 13 x 0 + 19 x 0 + 45 x 0 + 84 x 0\n    which is 0 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 11. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 0, 4, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 3, 0, 4, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

They're keeping all of item 3, suggesting they value it highly.\n\n### 3) Decision Making:\n\nThe current offer's value to me (323) is significantly higher than my outside offer (11). This is a good deal for me.\n\nHowever, I should consider making a counteroffer to try to get more value. Player 1 seems to value item 3 highly and item 4 less.\n\nLet's try a counteroffer where I aim to get:\n- Keep all of items 2, 4, and 5 (which Player 1 seems to value less)\n- Split item 3 more evenly\n- Give up item 1 (only 1 unit anyway)\n\nMy counteroffer to Player 1 would be [1, 0, 3, 0, 0], meaning I'd keep [0, 3, 3, 4, 2].\n\nValue of my counteroffer to me:\n- 0 units of item 1: 0 \u00d7 20 = 0\n- 3 units of item 2: 3 \u00d7 13 = 39\n- 3 units of item 3: 3 \u00d7 19 = 57\n- 4 units of item 4: 4 \u00d7 45 = 180\n- 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 84 = 168\n- Total value: 444\n\nThis value (444) is much better than my outside offer (11) and better than Player 1's current offer to me (323).\n\nSince this is only round 1, it makes sense to counteroffer and try to get more value, especially since Player 1's initial offer already revealed some information about their preferences.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 3, 0, 0]}",

The current offer on the table (from Player 2) is given as [1, 0, 3, 0, 0]. Remember, when an offer is made, it is the bundle offered to me; the remaining items (computed by subtracting these numbers from the totals) would go to Player 2.\n\n\u2003\u2003So if I accept, I get:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 1 (value: 1\u00d781 = 81)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 0 (value: 0\u00d711 = 0)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 3 (value: 3\u00d791 = 273)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 0 (value: 0\u00d741 = 0)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 0 (value: 0\u00d788 = 0)\n\u2003\u2003Total undiscounted value = 81 + 273 = 354.\n\n5. Since we are in Round 2 and the discount factor \u03b3 = 0.98 applies once (\u03b3^(r\u20131) = 0.98^(2\u20131) = 0.98), the present value if I accept the deal is:\n\u2003\u2003Discounted value = 354 \u00d7 0.98 \u2248 347.\n\n6.

                    "response": "Step 1: To decide on our first offer as Player 1 we first note that the full bundle is worth 859 to us. Our private per\u2010unit values are:\n\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 99 (1 unit)\n\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 49 (3 units)\n\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 43 (3 units)\n\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 85 (4 units)\n\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 72 (2 units)\nso our total = 99 + 3\u00b749 + 3\u00b743 + 4\u00b785 + 2\u00b772 = 859.\n\nStep 2: We also have an outside offer of 412. In any agreement we must do at least as well as 412 (after discounting) so that our deal is worthwhile. Of course, we wish to secure even more.\n\nStep 3: We have to decide how to split up the items. Although we do not know Player 2\u2019s private values, both sides know that their values come uniformly from 1 to 101. That means the (unconditional) average per\u2010unit value is roughly 51. Comparing that with our own values item\u2013by\u2013item, we see:\n\u2003\u2022 Item 1: We value at 99 (far above the average 51). We have a strong incentive to keep item 1.\n\u2003\u2022 Item 2: We value 49 (roughly average), so Player 2 might do at least as well with it.\n\u2003\u2022 Item 3: We value 43 (a bit lower than average), so again this is likely more attractive to Player 2.\n\u2003\u2022 Item 4: We value 85 (well above average), so we want to keep it.\n\u2003\u2022 Item 5: We value 72 (above average), so we prefer keeping it but might be willing to share one unit to help meet Player 2\u2019s potential reservation value.\n\nStep 4: One natural proposal is then to let Player 2 have the items they are likely to favor\u2014items 2 and 3 (their full counts)\u2014while we keep items that we particularly favor\u2014item 1, all of item 4, and most of item 5. (Our rationale is that items 2 and 3, with lower value to us, are \u201ccheaper\u201d concessions.) However, if we gave Player 2 only these (3 units of item 2 and 3 units of item 3), then from our side we would be left with a value of 1\u00b799 + 4\u00b785 + 2\u00b772 = 99 + 340 + 144 = 583, while Player 2 would get (from our perspective) 3\u00b749 + 3\u00b743 = 147 + 129 = 276 in our \u201ccurrency.\u201d Given that Player 2\u2019s own actual numbers are unknown, an offer that gives them a \u201cslice\u201d corresponding roughly to an expected value of about 276 (or roughly 306 if using an approximate mean for items 2 and 3) might not be competitive with their outside offer (whose expected level could be around half of their potential total). \n\nStep 5: To make the proposal more enticing for Player 2, we can \u201csweeten\u201d it by transferring one additional unit from an item we value (and the opponent would likely value around the average of 51). We choose one unit of item 5: this is only a sacrifice of 72 for us while it adds about 51 (or possibly a bit more if Player 2\u2019s private value is high) in expected worth for them. In this proposal the division is:\n\u2003\u2022 Player 1 keeps:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 1: all 1 unit\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 4: all 4 units\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 5: 1 unit (keeping 1 unit out of 2)\n\u2003\u2022 Player 2 receives:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 2: all 3 units\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 3: all 3 units\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 5: 1 unit\n\nStep 6: In our terms, the offer is defined by the number of units we offer to Player 2 for each item type. That is:\n\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 0\u2003\u2003(since we keep the only unit)\n\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 3\u2003\u2003(giving all 3 units)\n\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 3\u2003\u2003(giving all 3 units)\n\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 0\u2003\u2003(we keep all 4 units)\n\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 1\u2003\u2003(giving 1 out of 2)\n\nStep 7: With this proposed division our own immediate (undiscounted) value is:\n\u20031\u00b799 + 4\u00b785 + 1\u00b772 = 99 + 340 + 72 = 511 \nand our opponent\u2019s share (from our perspective) is:\n\u20033\u00b749 + 3\u00b743 + 1\u00b772 = 147 + 129 + 72 = 348.\nGiven that the overall pie totals 859 (since 511 + 348 = 859) and considering the discount factor if the negotiation continues further, this division both preserves a substantial gain for us relative to our reservation value of 412 while also offering Player 2 a package (expected to be around 348\u2013357 in value on their side, considering the uniform distribution of values) that should be competitive with their outside offer.\n\nStep 8: Therefore, in this first round, we propose to offer Player 2 the items in the following way: [0, 3, 3, 0, 1].\n\nOur response must be in the following format:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 3, 0, 1]}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 3, 2, 4, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    37 x 1 + 71 x 3 + 26 x 2 + 4 x 4 + 14 x 2\n    which is 346 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 348. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 3, 3, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 3, 3, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

(Because we are in round\u202f2 the \u201cpresent\u2010value\u201d of a deal would be 412\u00b70.98, but that factor applies equally to any immediate deal.) In effect I already have the \u201csafety\u201d guarantee of an outside offer (412) and an offer that equals it.\n\nLooking back at the earlier history I see that my original proposal in round 1 \u2013 offering Player 2 [0,3,3,0,1] \u2013 would have left me with the complementary bundle [1,0,0,4,1]. This would have given me 1\u00b799 + 4\u00b785 + 1\u00b772 = 99 + 340 + 72 = 511. But Player 2 countered with [0,0,0,4,1] in round 1 because (presumably) they saw value in keeping the item\u20101 unit (and hence awarding themselves the complement, which would be 1 unit of item 1). In equilibrium it appears that Player 2 values having that one unit of item 1 enough to \u201cbuy\u201d me down to 412.\n\nI want to try to \u201csteal\u201d a little extra value \u2013 essentially by offering to give up the prized item 1 while handing over a bit more of an item that (on average) may be valued less by Player\u00a02. A counteroffer that \u201cswaps\u201d the item\u20101 unit for an additional unit of item 4 seems promising. Specifically, if I propose that Player\u00a02 gets, instead of [1,3,3,0,1] (which is what they get if we accept the current offer) the bundle [0,3,3,1,1], then the complementary allocation for me becomes [1,0,0,3,1]. My value then would be\n\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 1\u00b799 = 99  \n\u2003\u2003Item 4: 3\u00b785 = 255  \n\u2003\u2003Item 5: 1\u00b772 = 72  \n\u2003\u2003Total = 99 + 255 + 72 = 426\n\nThis is an improvement over 412 (by 14 points) for me. And for Player 2 the \u201closs\u201d of losing the unit of item 1 is roughly offset by \u201cgaining\u201d one unit of item 4; if we assume (as expected from uniform draws) that Player 2\u2019s per\u2010unit values are on average lower than mine, then on average the value of a unit of item 1 (for them) would be around 51 while the unit of item 4 we\u2019re transferring is 85 to me but typically around the mean (~51) for them too. In other words, from Player\u00a02\u2019s perspective this deal is roughly as appealing as the current offer, and insisting on it in a later round would incur an extra discounting of 0.98 in value.\n\nThus I propose a counteroffer that gives Player\u00a02 the bundle [0, 3, 3, 1, 1] (so that I keep [1, 0, 0, 3, 1]), which improves my immediate outcome from 412 to 426 without worsening the \u201coffer value\u201d for Player 2 (given our approximate estimates). \n\nMy action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 3, 1, 1]}",

                    "prompt": "\n    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\n    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\n    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\n    There are 1 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\n    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\n    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 101.\n    Your private values are 37 for item 1, 71 for item 2, 26 for item 3, 4 for item 4, 14 for item 5.\n    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to your total value of all items, which is 372. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 348. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 348. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 456 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 3, 2, 4, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    37 x 1 + 71 x 3 + 26 x 2 + 4 x 4 + 14 x 2\n    which is 346 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 348. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 3, 3, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 4, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 3, 3, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 3, 3, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Based on our private per\u2010unit values (item1: 99, item2: 49, item3: 43, item4: 85, item5: 72), this deal gives us a raw value of 4\u00d785 = 340. Because we are in round 3, the discount factor applies with \u03b3^(r\u20131) = 0.98\u00b2 \u2248 0.9604; so our present\u2010value payoff if we accept would be about 340\u00d70.9604 \u2248 326.5.\n\nBy contrast, our outside offer is 412. Thus, if we accept the current deal our effective payoff (\u2248327) is significantly less than our safe alternative of 412.\n\nWe could try to counteroffer. However, our earlier offers in previous rounds (for example, our round 2 offer of [0,3,3,1,1] would leave us with (1,0,0,3,1) which has a raw value of 99 + 3\u00d785 + 72 = 426 \u2013 barely above our \u201ctarget\u201d but, if we try to extract even a slightly better division than the current offer, we must \u201ctake\u201d from items (like 1 or 5) that Player2\u2019s earlier proposals indicate they value highly. (For instance, in round 1 Player2\u2019s offer [0,0,0,4,1] and in round 2 their offer [0,0,0,4,0] imply they want to keep items 1, 2, 3 and (in at least one round) item 5.) In other words, any counteroffer that would raise our raw utility to a sufficiently high level (roughly 430 raw points, for a present\u2010value over 412) would likely require us to take away from Player2 at least one unit of an item they appear to regard as highly valuable. In the end, there is no counteroffer that both gives us an effective value better than our outside option and leaves Player2 enough \u201cincentive\u201d to accept it (since if Player2 does not accept in round 3, any counteroffer they try to make would count as a walk away). \n\nThus, in round 3 the best course for us is to walk away from negotiations and secure our outside offer of 412 rather than accepting a deal that gives us a discounted value around 327 or risking a counteroffer that Player2 is unlikely to accept.\n\nTherefore, our action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

In a \u201cfair\u2010split\u201d (Nash bargaining\u2013like) idea one might expect him to require roughly that much.\n\nI know my own values:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item\u00a01: 92\u2003\u2013 I have a very good \u201cdeal\u201d on these.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item\u00a02: 40\u2003\u2013 Not so good (it\u2019s lower than the expected 51 for Player\u00a02).\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item\u00a03: 20\u2003\u2013 Even worse for me\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item\u00a05: 5\u2003\u2013 Very poor for me.\n\u2003\u2003(Item\u00a04 has 0 units so it is not in play.)\n\nThus, I want to \u201ckeep\u201d item\u00a01 entirely, since they\u2019re very valuable to me relative to the average. On the other hand, for items on which I am at a disadvantage (items\u00a02, 3, and 5) I am inclined to concede as many units as possible to meet Player\u00a02\u2018s acceptance threshold. Since in expectation Player\u00a02\u2019s average value per unit is about 51, giving him a \u201cbundle\u201d whose overall expected worth is around 408 should be just enough in the first round.\n\nLooking at the available numbers:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Items 3 and 5 are \u201ccheap\u201d for me. I give him all 5 units of item\u00a03 and both units of item\u00a05. That\u2019s 7 units. At an average of 51 that comes to roughly 357.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 I need roughly one more unit\u2019s worth (about 51) to reach the rough 408 threshold. I can get that from item\u00a02. Thus I give him 1 unit of item\u00a02.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 I then keep all of item\u00a01 and the other 4 units of item\u00a02.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 (Item\u00a04 is not available anyway.)\n\nSo the proposed division (where the list [n1, n2, n3, n4, n5] means the number of units of each item I am offering to Player\u00a02) is:\n\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 0\u2003\u2003Item 2: 1\u2003\u2003Item 3: 5\u2003\u2003Item 4: 0\u2003\u2003Item 5: 2\n\nUnder this proposal my \u201cshare\u201d is what remains:\n\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 4 (4\u00d792 = 368), Item 2: 4 (4\u00d740 = 160), and nothing in items 3,4,5. Total value = 368 + 160 = 528, which is well above my outside option value.\n\nPlayer\u00a02 would get \u2013 if his values are near average \u2013 an expected value of roughly:\n\u2003\u2003Item 2: 1\u00d751 = 51, Item 3: 5\u00d751 = 255, Item 5: 2\u00d751 = 102, total \u2248408.\n\nThis offer keeps my outcome high while giving Player\u00a02 a bundle that meets his likely reservation value. (Of course, his true private values might differ but as an initial offer this structure takes advantage of my strong position in item\u00a01.)\n\nSo my action will be to propose this counteroffer as my initial offer.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \n  \"offer\": [0, 1, 5, 0, 2]\n}",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 496. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 496. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 456 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 4, 5, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    32 x 4 + 11 x 4 + 55 x 5 + 32 x 0 + 22 x 2\n    which is 491 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 496. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 5, 0, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 5, 0, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "I'll analyze this situation step by step:\n\n1) Current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 496\n   - My item values: Item 1 (32), Item 2 (11), Item 3 (55), Item 4 (32), Item 5 (22)\n   - Total pool: 4 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5\n   - Discount factor is 0.98, so waiting longer reduces the value\n\n2) Assess the current offer:\n   Player 1 offered me [0, 1, 5, 0, 2], which means I would get:\n   - 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 32 = 0\n   - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 11 = 11\n   - 5 units of item 3 = 5 \u00d7 55 = 275\n   - 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 32 = 0\n   - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 22 = 44\n   Total value to me = 330, which is less than my outside offer of 496\n\n3) Potential counteroffer:\n   I need to keep enough value for myself while making a reasonable offer. Let me try:\n   - If I keep all item 3 (my highest value): 5 \u00d7 55 = 275\n   - If I keep all item 1: 4 \u00d7 32 = 128\n   - If I keep 3 units of item 2: 3 \u00d7 11 = 33\n   - Keep all item 5: 2 \u00d7 22 = 44\n   Total value for me would be 480, still less than my outside offer.\n\n   Let me adjust. If I keep all items except 2 units of item 2:\n   - 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 32 = 128\n   - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 11 = 33\n   - 5 units of item 3 = 5 \u00d7 55 = 275\n   - 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 32 = 0\n   - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 22 = 44\n   Total value for me = 480, still less than outside offer.\n\n   I need to keep more. Let me try keeping all items except 1 unit of item 2:\n   - Keep 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 32 = 128\n   - Keep 4 units of item 2 = 4 \u00d7 11 = 44\n   - Keep 5 units of item 3 = 5 \u00d7 55 = 275\n   - Keep 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 32 = 0\n   - Keep 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 22 = 44\n   Total value for me = 491, which is still less than my outside offer.\n\n   It seems almost impossible to get a value higher than my outside offer of 496 given the total value of all items is only 502. My best option would be to offer a minimal counteroffer that preserves my chances of making a deal in later rounds, or to walk away.\n\nLet me try one more counteroffer calculation where I offer only 1 unit of item 1 to Player 1:\n- Give 1 unit of item 1, keep 3 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96\n- Keep all item 2 = 5 \u00d7 11 = 55\n- Keep all item 3 = 5 \u00d7 55 = 275\n- Keep all item 4 = 0 \u00d7 32 = 0\n- Keep all item 5 = 2 \u00d7 22 = 44\nTotal value for me = 470, which is still less than my outside offer.\n\nGiven that my outside offer (496) is extremely close to the total possible value (502), it's very difficult to construct any reasonable counteroffer that would exceed my outside offer. This suggests I should walk away.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

In my role as the first mover (by making the initial offer) I can propose a division \u2013 that is, an offer saying \u201cI give you (Player\u00a02) these quantities,\u201d which automatically means I get the remaining units.\n\nIn designing any offer I would (ideally) want to \u201cclaim\u201d as much as possible so that my share (when I sum up the values of the items I get) is at least 615. In parallel I must \u201cpay\u201d the opponent only \u201ccheaply\u201d (i.e. by giving him items I care relatively little about) while ensuring that\u2014by a rough estimate of his likely valuations\u2014he would prefer the proposed division to his private outside offer. In expectation (since his per\u2010unit values are drawn uniformly on [1,101]) his \u201ctypical\u201d value per item unit is roughly about 51, and his potential total value (using his unknown draws) is around 867. Hence his drawn outside offer tends to be around the midpoint (roughly 434). Thus, for him to prefer a deal the bundle he receives must \u201cfeel\u201d worth at least in the 430\u2013450 range in his eyes. (Remember that in round 1 the discount factor is 1.)\n\nA pure \u201ccake\u2010cutting\u201d type argument would tell me to \u201cminimize\u201d what I give away. In my own list the \u201ccheapest\u201d items are the ones I value the least. For me item\u202f1 is only worth 18 per unit, while item\u202f2 is 56 and item\u202f3 is 62. In order to provide Player\u00a02 with a bundle that \u201con expectation\u201d is worth roughly 430\u2013450 (if each unit is worth about 51 to him) I would need to assign him roughly 9 units total. (9 units \u00d7 51 \u2248 459.) \n\nI then looked at the \u201ccost\u201d to me of giving away items. For example, if I were to let him have all of item\u202f1 (2 units), then all of item\u202f2 (3 units), and then add 4 units from item\u202f3 (the cheapest next option), this sums to 2 + 3 + 4 = 9 units. However, that deal \u201ccosts\u201d me:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u202f1: 2\u00d718 = 36\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u202f2: 3\u00d756 = 168\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u202f3: 4\u00d762 = 248\nfor a total cost of 36 + 168 + 248 = 452.\nThen my share\u2019s value would be 1034 \u2212 452 = 582. This is below my outside offer of 615. (I would be \u201cworse off\u201d by settling, even though Player\u00a02 might like the 459\u2013value he gets on expectation.) \n\nI explored many other possibilities trying to \u201creshuffle\u201d the 9 units that Player\u00a02 must receive (to meet his likely reservation) among the low\u2010value items for me. In every case the \u201ccost\u201d in my own value always came out too high; even if I tried to give fewer units in total (say 8) then Player\u00a02\u2019s expected value becomes very low (8\u00d751 = 408) so that he would very likely prefer his outside offer. In summary, any division that makes Player\u00a02 willing to accept \u2013 by providing him enough \u201ccake\u201d as measured in (roughly) 9 units \u2013 ends up giving me less than 615 in my own evaluation, which is strictly worse than simply \u201cwalking away\u201d and taking my outside offer.\n\nBecause any \u201creasonable\u201d initial offer that gives Player\u00a02 enough room to accept would leave me with less than what I can guarantee outside (615) and discount is not a factor in round\u202f1, my best safeguard is not to enter into a risky deal at this point.\n\nTherefore, I choose to WALK (i.e. quit negotiations).\n\nMy action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

                    "response": "I want to get a good deal while \u201cleaving on the table\u201d items that, according to my own values, are relatively cheap for me but might be more attractive to Player\u00a02.

I also know that\u2014although I do not know Player\u00a02\u2019s private numbers\u2014their per\u2010unit values are drawn uniformly from 1 to 101. (Thus, on average their value per unit is roughly 51.) Because I propose first in a three\u2010round negotiation with only a small per\u2010round discount (\u03b3 = 0.98), I can \u201cearn\u201d some extra surplus by keeping the items I value highly (even if Player\u00a02 might get a bit more value than I do on them on average) while offering them the items which are relatively \u201ccheap\u201d for me. For example, I value item\u00a01 very highly (58 compared to roughly 51 on average) so I want to keep all 4 units for myself. Items 2 and 5, on the other hand, have low value for me (16 and 3, respectively) and so giving them entirely to Player\u00a02 should \u201ccost\u201d me little while potentially making the offer acceptable to them. In addition, I assign all of item\u00a03 (value 30 each for me) to Player\u00a02 even though that sums to 90 in my scale, and I do part of item\u00a04: I give Player\u00a02 4 out of 7 units (worth 4\u00d744 = 176 to me) so that I keep only 3 units (worth 132) of item\u00a04. Under this split my \u201cown\u201d side comes out as follows:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Player\u00a01 gets: all 4 units of item\u00a01 (232) plus 3 units of item\u00a04 (132) = 364.\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Player\u00a02 gets everything else:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item\u00a02: 2 units \u2192 32,\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item\u00a03: 3 units \u2192 90,\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item\u00a04: 4 units \u2192 176,\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item\u00a05: 2 units \u2192 6,\n\u2003\u2003for a total of 32 + 90 + 176 + 6 = 304.\nThis division of the \u201cpie\u201d (364 to me, 304 to Player\u00a02) is roughly in line with what one might expect in alternating\u2010offer bargaining with a high discount factor\u2014even if it is a bit \u201cproposer\u2010favorable.\u201d By giving Player\u00a02 all of the items I \u201cdon\u2019t mind\u201d letting go (especially items 2 and 5, which are low for me yet might be more valuable for them), I try to hit a point where Player\u00a02 prefers to accept rather than try for a later round (and suffer discounting).\n\nThus, my initial offer (which is what I give to Player\u00a02) is to allocate:\n\u2003Item\u00a01: 0 units,\n\u2003Item\u00a02: all 2 units,\n\u2003Item\u00a03: all 3 units,\n\u2003Item\u00a04: 4 out of 7 units,\n\u2003Item\u00a05: both (2) units.\n\nI now respond in the required format:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 3, 4, 2]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 0, 6, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    90 x 0 + 9 x 2 + 74 x 0 + 76 x 6 + 10 x 2\n    which is 494 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 495. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 3, 4, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 3, 4, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "I\u2019ll explain my thinking briefly. My overall \u201cpie\u201d has a total value of 878 (using my values: 6\u00d720, 5\u00d742, 3\u00d748, 4\u00d779, 8\u00d711). In a three\u2010round bargaining situation with a discount factor of 0.98 the proposer (me) has some bargaining advantage. In a classic alternating\u2010offers solution (with nearly equal discounting) the equilibrium split is roughly even (about 50\u201350 in value). However, since I know my own values very well and I favor some items more than others, I can \u201cpackage\u201d the offer so that I hand over parts of the \u201cpie\u201d that I value relatively less while keeping most of the high\u2013value items.\n\nLooking at my numbers, I value item4 (79 per unit) and, to a lesser extent, item3 (48 per unit) especially highly. On the other hand I value item1 (20 per unit), item2 (42 per unit) and item5 (11 per unit) relatively lower. In order to give Player 2 a package that \u2013 by my own measure \u2013 is nearly 50% of the total (about 439 in my scale) while keeping a bit more than half for myself, one natural idea is to let Player 2 have all of the items I value less but keep item3 and item4 (the ones that really matter most to me). In numbers that means:\n \n\u2022 Give Player 2 all 6 units of item 1  \n\u2022 Give Player 2 all 5 units of item 2  \n\u2022 Give Player 2 all 8 units of item 5  \n\u2022 Give nothing of items 3 and 4\n\nThis offer would leave me with item 3 (3 units) and item 4 (4 units). By my valuation that yields:\n\u2003\u2013 My payoff: 3\u00d748 + 4\u00d779 = 144 + 316 = 460  \n\u2003\u2013 Player 2\u2019s \u201cshare\u201d according to my numbers: 6\u00d720 + 5\u00d742 + 8\u00d711 = 120 + 210 + 88 = 418\n\nThat split is a bit in my favor (460 vs. 418) \u2013 which is what I want as the first mover in a three\u2013round negotiation with discounting. (It is, of course, possible that Player 2\u2019s private values will lead him to evaluate the packages differently; however, in expectation a near\u2013even split is expected to be acceptable.)\n\nThus, as my initial offer (given that my available actions are to either WALK or propose an offer by listing the number of units of each item that I give Player 2), I choose to propose the following division:\n\nOffer to Player 2: [6, 5, 0, 0, 8]\n\nSo my final answer is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [6, 5, 0, 0, 8]}",

                    "prompt": "\n    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\n    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\n    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\n    There are 6 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 8 units of item 5 to divide.\n    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\n    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 101.\n    Your private values are 64 for item 1, 60 for item 2, 64 for item 3, 62 for item 4, 5 for item 5.\n    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to your total value of all items, which is 1164. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 923. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 923. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 765 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [6, 2, 3, 3, 8] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    64 x 6 + 60 x 2 + 64 x 3 + 62 x 3 + 5 x 8\n    which is 922 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 923. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [6, 5, 0, 0, 8]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [6, 5, 0, 0, 8]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "I need to analyze this offer and decide whether to accept, counteroffer, or walk away.\n\n## Step 1: Analyze the current situation\n\n- My outside offer value: 923\n- My item values: 64 for item 1, 60 for item 2, 64 for item 3, 62 for item 4, 5 for item 5\n- Total pool of items: 6 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 8 units of item 5\n- Discount factor: 0.98\n\n## Step 2: Assess the value of offers\n\nLet me calculate the value of the current offer (what Player 1 is offering me):\n- 6 units of item 1 = 6 \u00d7 64 = 384\n- 5 units of item 2 = 5 \u00d7 60 = 300\n- 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 64 = 0\n- 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 62 = 0\n- 8 units of item 5 = 8 \u00d7 5 = 40\n- Total value = 724\n\nSince this is round 1, the discount factor doesn't apply yet.\n\nThe current offer (724) is less than my outside offer (923), so I should not accept it.\n\nLooking at what Player 1 has offered, they've kept all of items 3 and 4 for themselves while offering me all of items 1, 2, and 5. This suggests they might value items 3 and 4 highly, while placing less value on items 1, 2, and 5.\n\n## Step 3: Make a decision based on the analysis\n\nI need to formulate a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than my outside offer (923). Since items 1, 3, and 4 have the highest value for me, I should try to keep as many of these as possible.\n\nLet me create a counteroffer:\n- I'll keep 5 units of item 1 (giving 1 to Player 1): 5 \u00d7 64 = 320\n- I'll keep 4 units of item 2 (giving 1 to Player 1): 4 \u00d7 60 = 240\n- I'll keep all 3 units of item 3: 3 \u00d7 64 = 192\n- I'll keep all 4 units of item 4: 4 \u00d7 62 = 248\n- I'll give all 8 units of item 5 to Player 1 (keeping 0): 0 \u00d7 5 = 0\n\nTotal value for me: 320 + 240 + 192 + 248 + 0 = 1000\n\nThis gives me a value of 1000, which is greater than my outside offer of 923.\n\nSo my counteroffer to Player 1 will be: [1, 1, 0, 0, 8]\n\nThis means I'm offering Player 1:\n- 1 unit of item 1\n- 1 unit of item 2\n- 0 units of item 3\n- 0 units of item 4\n- 8 units of item 5\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 0, 8]}",

While you could try counteroffering for a slightly better outcome, doing so risks delay (another round of discounting) and the possibility that Player 2 may not agree.

My aim is to \u201canchor\u201d the division so that I claim most of what I value highly (in this case items 4 and 5, which give me 49 and 27 per unit) while offering a roughly even\u2010split on the items that I value less (items 1\u20133) to try to give Player 2 just enough so they see a deal as better than walking away (their outside offer is unknown but likely not high). In other words, since I know my own values and that my full \u201cpie\u201d is worth 298 to me, I want to leave myself with the high\u2010value items. (If I gave away some of items 4 or 5 then my outcome would drop sharply.) \n\nFor item 1 (6 units available, value 18 each) it seems \u201cfair\u201d to offer half the units (3) so that I keep a good share while still giving Player 2 some share. For item 2 (2 units, value 12 each) I offer 1 unit. For item 3 (1 unit, value 14) I offer that single unit; since it\u2019s only one unit, Player 2 gets it all. For the two items that I value much more (item 4 with 2 units worth 49 each and item 5 with 2 units worth 27 each) I offer nothing so that I capture almost all of their high \u201cprivate\u2010value\u201d potential. \n\nUnder this proposed division my allocation would be: \n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 1: I keep 3 units (3\u00d718 = 54) \n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 2: I keep 1 unit (1\u00d712 = 12) \n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 3: I get 0 (0\u00d714 = 0) \n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 4: I get all 2 units (2\u00d749 = 98) \n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 5: I get all 2 units (2\u00d727 = 54) \nfor a total of 54 + 12 + 98 + 54 = 218 in my own utility (undiscounted in round 1). \n\nPlayer 2 would get [3, 1, 1, 0, 0] (for items 1\u20135 respectively). Although I do not know Player 2\u2019s private values, this offer retains the high\u2010value items for me while offering some \u201cfair\u201d portions of the rest so that the deal is (hopefully) attractive relative to their unknown outside offer. \n\nThus, my first\u2010round move is to propose a counteroffer giving Player 2 the following division:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 1, 1, 0, 0]}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 0, 1, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    54 x 5 + 87 x 0 + 84 x 1 + 44 x 2 + 3 x 2\n    which is 448 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 450. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

So the discounted value is 139 \u00d7 0.98 \u2248 136.22.\n\u2022 Your outside offer is 39, so this deal is much better than walking away.\n\nStep 2: Consider a Counteroffer\n\u2022 You have the option to counteroffer. In a counteroffer you\u2019d declare what you give to Player 2, meaning you\u2019d keep the other items.\n\u2022 For instance, compared to the current offer, you might try to secure more of the high\u2010value items (especially item 4 which is worth 49 per unit and item 5 worth 27). However, giving Player 2 less than their current share ([4,2,1,1,0] if you accepted the current proposal) might risk them rejecting your offer.\n\u2022 A counteroffer, if rejected, would push negotiations into round 3 where the discount factor becomes 0.98\u00b2 \u2248 0.96, lowering the overall payoff.\n\u2022 Given that the current offer already gives you a high discounted value (\u2248136.22) compared to your outside option (39) and considering the risk of delay, a counteroffer might jeopardize this favorable outcome.\n\nStep 3: Decision\n\u2022 Accepting the current offer secures a solid (discounted) value.\n\u2022 The risk of negotiating further (even with a small improvement attempt) might result in a lower payoff if a delay occurs.\n\u2022 Therefore, the best action is to accept the current offer.\n\nFinal Action:\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

This might indicate they value items 4 and 5 more than the others.\n\nGiven my values, I care most about:\n1. Item 1 (83 per unit)\n2. Item 4 (37 per unit)\n3. Item 3 (22 per unit)\n4. Items 2 and 5 (9 per unit each)\n\nLet me design a counteroffer that keeps most of my high-value items and offers some of my lower-value items:\n\nIf I keep:\n- 5 units of item 1 = 5 \u00d7 83 = 415\n- 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 9 = 0\n- 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 22 = 0\n- 8 units of item 4 = 8 \u00d7 37 = 296\n- 4 units of item 5 = 4 \u00d7 9 = 36\n\nTotal value = 415 + 0 + 0 + 296 + 36 = 747\n\nThis is less than my outside offer of 863, so I need to keep more items.\n\nLet me try again:\n- 5 units of item 1 = 5 \u00d7 83 = 415\n- 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 9 = 0\n- 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 22 = 44\n- 8 units of item 4 = 8 \u00d7 37 = 296\n- 5 units of item 5 = 5 \u00d7 9 = 45\n\nTotal value = 415 + 0 + 44 + 296 + 45 = 800\n\nStill less than my outside offer.\n\nLet's try one more time:\n- 5 units of item 1 = 5 \u00d7 83 = 415\n- 1 units of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 9 = 9\n- 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66\n- 8 units of item 4 = 8 \u00d7 37 = 296\n- 9 units of item 5 = 9 \u00d7 9 = 81\n\nTotal value = 415 + 9 + 66 + 296 + 81 = 867\n\nThis is greater than my outside offer of 863, so this is a viable counteroffer.\n\nThis means I would offer Player 1:\n- 0 units of item 1\n- 3 units of item 2\n- 1 unit of item 3\n- 0 units of item 4\n- 0 units of item 5\n\n### Step 4: Make my decision\n\nSince Player 1's offer gives me a value of 456, which is much less than my outside offer of 863, I should make a counteroffer. I will offer Player 1 [0, 3, 1, 0, 0], which gives me a value of 867, slightly better than my outside offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 1, 0, 0]}",

My current outside option of 949 is far higher than the value (59) I would get from accepting Player 2\u2019s current offer ([0, 3, 1, 0, 0]). (Discounting in Round 2 with \u03b3 = 0.98 makes that offer worth about 0.98\u00b759 \u2248 57.8\u2014far too low compared to 949.)\n\n2. In Round 1 I had made an offer [4, 4, 4, 0, 0] (giving me the remainder of [1, 0, 0, 8, 9]). That allocation would have given me \n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 1: 1\u00d747 = 47  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 4: 8\u00d755 = 440  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 5: 9\u00d754 = 486  \n\u2003\u2003for a total of 47 + 440 + 486 = 973 (already above my outside offer).  \nHowever, Player 2 rejected that offer (and countered with [0, 3, 1, 0, 0])\u2014so now I need to revise my proposal to secure a deal that both gives me more than my outside offer and is attractive enough for Player 2 to accept (i.e. it gives them at least as much, from their own perspective, as waiting might).\n\n3. I now try to \u201ctrade\u201d items by giving Player 2 those items that I value relatively less while keeping those that are most valuable to me. My private values are:\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 47, Item 2: 12, Item 3: 23, Item 4: 55, Item 5: 54.\nThus, items 2 and 3 are relatively \u201ccheaper\u201d for me. To further sweeten the deal, I can also give a small part of item 1, while retaining most of items 4 and 5.\n\n4. A reasonable counteroffer is to give Player 2 one unit of item 1 along with all units of items 2 and 3. In numbers that offer is [1, 4, 4, 0, 0]. With that offer:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 I keep the remainder:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Item 1: 5 \u2013 1 = 4 units  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Item 2: 4 \u2013 4 = 0  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Item 3: 4 \u2013 4 = 0  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Item 4: 8  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Item 5: 9  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 My value then is 4\u00d747 + 8\u00d755 + 9\u00d754 = 188 + 440 + 486 = 1114, which (even after discounting in Round 2: 1114\u00d70.98 \u2248 1091) is comfortably above 949.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 For Player 2, receiving an entire bundle of items 2 and 3 (and a little bit of item 1) should be an improvement over the earlier offer they made (in which they tried to grab low\u2010value items by my measure), making this a plausible settlement for both parties.\n\n5. Considering my outside option and the discount factor, I can do better than the current offer and safely propose this counteroffer.\n\nThus, my move is to propose the counteroffer that gives Player 2 [1, 4, 4, 0, 0].\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 4, 4, 0, 0]}",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 0, 4, 8, 7] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    83 x 5 + 9 x 0 + 22 x 4 + 37 x 8 + 9 x 7\n    which is 862 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 863. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [4, 4, 4, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 3, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 4, 4, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 4, 4, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Let me adjust by offering fewer items to Player 1.\n\n   If I offer Player 1: [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n   \n   I would keep: [5, 2, 4, 8, 9]\n   Value to me:\n   - 5 units of item 1: 5 \u00d7 83 = 415\n   - 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 9 = 18\n   - 4 units of item 3: 4 \u00d7 22 = 88\n   - 8 units of item 4: 8 \u00d7 37 = 296\n   - 9 units of item 5: 9 \u00d7 9 = 81\n   Total value: 898 \u00d7 0.9604 = 862.44 (with next round's discount)\n\n   This is still slightly less than my outside offer after discount.\n\n4) Decision:\n\n   Since we're in round 2 and Player 1's offers have been consistently worse than my outside offer, and even my optimized counteroffer would likely be worth less than my outside offer after the next round's discount, the rational choice is to walk away and take my guaranteed 863.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

                    "response": "My reasoning:\n1. I first estimated my total value if I got everything:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 1: 5\u00d794 = 470\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 2: 7\u00d754 = 378\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 3: 1\u00d74 = 4\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 4: 5\u00d757 = 285\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 5: 5\u00d773 = 365\n\u2003\u2003Total = 1502.\nMy outside offer is 748, so any deal I agree to must net me more than 748 (after discounting, though round 1 has no discount).\n\n2. Knowing that Player 2\u2019s private per\u2010unit values are drawn uniformly (average \u224851 per unit) and that their total if they got every unit would be around 1173, I expect their \u201cdisagreement\u201d value (outside option) to be roughly half \u2013 around 586 on average. Thus, I need to offer them enough \u201cexpected value\u201d above that threshold so that they are incentivized to accept the deal.\n\n3. Since I can choose which items to give to Player 2, I try to \u201coffload\u201d items that are least valuable to me. My lowest\u2010valued item is item 3 (value 4) and then items 2 (value 54) and 4 (value 57). On the other hand, items 1 (value 94) and 5 (value 73) are relatively expensive for me, so I wish to keep them.\n\n4. The available items total 23 units. For player 2, an offer totaling roughly 12 units gives an expected value near 12\u00d751 = 612, which is above their estimated outside level. More precisely, I plan to offer:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 All of item 2\u2019s 7 units,\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 All of item 3\u2019s 1 unit,\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 And 4 of the 5 units of item 4.\nThis totals 7+1+4 = 12 units. I keep every unit of items 1 and 5 and the remaining 1 unit of item 4.\n\n5. My allocated bundle then is:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 1: 5 units (value 5\u00d794 = 470)\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 2: 0 units\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 3: 0 units\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 4: 1 unit (value 57)\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 5: 5 units (value 365)\n\u2003\u2003Total = 470+57+365 = 892, which exceeds my outside offer and leaves room for efficient negotiation in round 1.\n\n6. Thus, the initial offer I submit is giving Player 2: [0, 7, 1, 4, 0] units respectively.\n\nMy action is then:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 7, 1, 4, 0]}",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 398. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 398. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 693 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 5, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    38 x 0 + 7 x 0 + 77 x 0 + 72 x 5 + 37 x 1\n    which is 397 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 398. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 7, 1, 4, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 7, 1, 4, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Compare our value to the typical 51:\n\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 90 vs. 51\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2192 difference +39 (we really want item 1)\n\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 48 vs. 51\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2192 difference \u20133 (we are slightly \u201cworse off\u201d here, so it\u2019s favorable to concede)\n\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 80 vs. 51\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2192 difference +29 (we would prefer to keep most)\n\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 80 vs. 51\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2192 difference +29 (moderate; we can sacrifice some to \u201cbuy\u201d Player\u00a02\u2019s acceptance)\n\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 87 vs. 51\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2192 difference +36 (we strongly prefer to keep these)\n\nStep 4: A 50\u201350 split in total counts would give Player\u00a02 about 8\u20139 units. To maximize our own value we want to give up our \u201ccomparatively low\u2013value\u201d item and, if necessary, some units of a moderately valued one. Conceding all 3 units of item 2 is relatively cheap for us, and it gives him 3 units. To reach roughly 9 units total we then need 6 more units from the other items. We want to avoid giving away high\u2013value items such as items 1 and 5. So we choose to concede from item 4 and (if needed) a little from item 3.\n\nStep 5: One possible division is:\n\u2003\u2022 Give Player\u00a02:\u20030 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 4 of item 4, and 0 of item 5.\n\u2003Then our allocation will be:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 1: 3 units (we keep all) \u2192 3\u00d790 = 270\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 2: 0 units \u2192 0\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 3: 1 unit (since 3\u20132 = 1) \u2192 1\u00d780 = 80\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 4: 0 units (4\u20134 = 0) \u2192 0\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 5: 4 units (we keep all) \u2192 4\u00d787 = 348\n\u2003Our total value = 270 + 80 + 348 = 698, which is above our outside option (675).\n\nPlayer\u00a02\u2019s bundle (by count) will be 3 + 2 + 4 = 9 units. Given that the items we are conceding (especially item 2 and item 4) are ones where our relative \u201ccost\u201d of concession is lower, Player\u00a02\u2019s likely expected value (around 9\u00d751 = 459) is appealing compared to his outside option.\n\nStep 6: Because we are the first proposer in round 1, we now issue our offer in the required format.\n\nThus, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 2, 4, 0]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 5. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1011 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    93 x 0 + 32 x 0 + 100 x 0 + 73 x 0 + 39 x 0\n    which is 0 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 5. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

That allocation has a value of 3\u00d790 + 0\u00d748 + 1\u00d780 + 0\u00d780 + 4\u00d787 = 270 + 0 + 80 + 0 + 348 = 698.)\n\nBut because my private outside offer is 675 (which by itself is not discounted) and we are now in round 2 (with discount factor \u03b3 = 0.98, so any deal gives me its raw value multiplied by 0.98), I must ensure that my deal leaves me with at least roughly 675 in present\u2010value terms. In round 2 a raw value of about 675/0.98 \u2248 689 would be needed; hence I\u2019d like a deal that gives me around 698 or higher raw value.\n\nMy round\u20111 proposal (\u201c[0, 3, 2, 4, 0]\u201d offered to Player\u00a02) would have given me the complement: [3, 0, 1, 0, 4] (with raw value 698) and Player\u00a02 the offer [0, 3, 2, 4, 0]. Although I see that Player\u00a02\u2019s current offer would give them (by complement) [3, 1, 3, 3, 1], I know that the current offer is far less attractive for me (using my values, it would yield only 437 points before discount, and \u2248428 after discount) than what I\u2019d get from my own round\u20111 proposal. Thus, even at round 2 discounting (which brings 698 down to about 684), the proposal [0, 3, 2, 4, 0] safely beats my outside offer (675). \n\nGiven that a deal is certainly preferable to a walk\u2010away outcome (which yields 675) and that I must get a raw value high enough to beat that threshold after discount, I opt to \u201crecycle\u201d my round\u20111 offer.

Since this offer is very favorable to me (giving me high-value items 3 and 4, plus all of item 2), I should accept it.\n\nGiven that:\n1. The current offer gives me 576.24 value (vs. outside offer of 5)\n2. Player 1 seems committed to this division\n3. We're in round 2, so further negotiation risks discount penalties\n4.

My private per\u2013unit values are: item1=82, item2=15, item3=77, item4=92, item5=34. I thereby have very high value for items 1, 3, and 4, while items 2 and 5 yield lower returns for me.\n2. In contrast, Player 2\u2019s values are drawn uniformly from 1 to 101 so that, on average, each unit is worth roughly 51 to them. Hence, items in which my own value is low (item2 and item5) will likely have comparatively higher expected value to Player 2.\n3. Given that our outside offer (reservation value) is 372 for me (and Player 2 has an unknown one from a similar range), I want to propose a division that gives them enough expected benefit so they prefer immediate agreement. I aim to \u201canchor\u201d negotiations by awarding Player 2 the items that matter less to me but are of expected higher worth to them.\n4. Thus, I propose to award Player 2 all 5 units of item2 (worth only 15 each for me) and all 5 units of item5 (worth 34 each) while keeping for myself item1 (1 unit at 82), item3 (6 units at 77), and item4 (4 units at 92). My own allocation then sums to a personal value of 82 + (6\u00d777) + (4\u00d792) = 82 + 462 + 368 = 912, which is well above my 372 outside option.\n5. Player 2\u2019s offer (all of item2 and item5) provides them with 5 units each; given the average value of about 51 per unit, they can expect an approximate value of (5\u00d751)+(5\u00d751)=255+255 = 510.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 5, 2, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    52 x 0 + 3 x 1 + 69 x 5 + 9 x 2 + 97 x 4\n    which is 754 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 755. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Under that offer the allocation (interpreting offers as \u201cwhat is given to the opponent\u201d) would have meant that I would obtain the leftover:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item1: I\u2019d have 1 (all of it),\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item2: 0,\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item3: 6 (all of it),\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item4: 4 (all of it),\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item5: 0.\nThat would be very attractive to me (value: 82 + 6\u00d777 + 4\u00d792 = 82 + 462 + 368 = 912, and discounted in round 2 to 912\u00d70.98 \u2248 893), but Player 2 countered in round 1 (and the current offer is different) so they clearly prefer a division that leaves them with some items.\n\nLooking at the current situation:\n\u2022 In the accepted offer (if I did nothing), the division is \u201ccomplementary\u201d to the offer:\n\u2003\u2013 I\u2019d get [0, 5, 0, 4, 0] and hence Player 2 gets the remainder:\n\u2003\u2003item1: 1, item2: 0, item3: 6, item4: 0, item5: 5.\nThat means Player 2\u2019s bundle is 1+6+5 = 12 units in total.\n\nI know my value ranking is roughly:\n\u2003Most: item4 (92), then item1 (82) and item3 (77), then item5 (34), and lastly item2 (15).\nThus in the current division I get my entire item4 (great) but I miss out on item1 and item3 \u2013 both of which I value highly.\n\nRecognizing that I can \u201ctrade\u201d with Player 2 by proposing a counteroffer that gives them an allocation similar in \u201csize\u201d to what they\u2019d get in the current deal while letting me keep the items I care most about, I consider the following idea:\n\u2003\u2022 Let Player 2 have item1 and all of item2.\n\u2003\u2022 I keep all of item3.\nThat means for item1 (total 1): I give all 1 unit to Player 2.\nFor item2 (total 5): I give all 5 to Player 2 (and I don\u2019t care much about item2 anyway).\nFor item3 (total 6): I keep all 6 (gaining 6\u00d777 = 462 in value).\nNow consider item4 and item5 (total 4 and 5, respectively). In the current proposal Player 2 gets none of item4 and all 5 of item5. In order to keep Player 2\u2019s \u201cpackage\u201d comparable, I can offer them a little of item4 while keeping most for myself.\nFor example, if I let Player 2 have 1 unit of item4 (so I keep 4\u20131 = 3 units, which gives me 3\u00d792 = 276) and give them all of item5 (all 5 units, which we assume is comparable in total \u201csize\u201d to the 5 units they got originally), then Player 2\u2019s new bundle becomes:\n\u2003\u2022 item1: 1 unit,\n\u2003\u2022 item2: 5 units,\n\u2003\u2022 item3: 0 units,\n\u2003\u2022 item4: 1 unit,\n\u2003\u2022 item5: 5 units.\nThey would get a total count of 1 + 5 + 0 + 1 + 5 = 12 units \u2013 the same \u201csize\u201d as their previous bundle.\nMy resulting allocation (the leftover) would be:\n\u2003\u2022 item1: 0,\n\u2003\u2022 item2: 0,\n\u2003\u2022 item3: all 6 units,\n\u2003\u2022 item4: 3 units,\n\u2003\u2022 item5: 0.\nMy total (pre\u2010discount) value then is:\n\u2003item3: 6\u00d777 = 462, plus item4: 3\u00d792 = 276, plus nothing from the other items, total 462+276 = 738.\nDiscounted (\u00d70.98) that is about 723.\nThat is much better for me than the current offer (434) and I\u2019ve given Player 2 a package of 12 items (and, assuming their hidden values are roughly symmetric with an average value near 51, their expected total remains comparable to how much they\u2019d get if I accepted their current offer).\n\nThus, I propose the counteroffer where the offer (the list we announce) is what I give Player 2:\n\u2003Offer = [item1, item2, item3, item4, item5] = [1, 5, 0, 1, 5].\n\nThis is a valid division (does not exceed any available quantities), and it reallocates the items so I keep the ones I value highly (item3 and most of item4) while giving Player 2 a bundle similar in \u201csize\u201d to what they already had.\n\nI now state my action in the required format:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 5, 0, 1, 5]}",

                    "prompt": "\n    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\n    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\n    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\n    There are 1 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\n    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\n    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 101.\n    Your private values are 52 for item 1, 3 for item 2, 69 for item 3, 9 for item 4, 97 for item 5.\n    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to your total value of all items, which is 1002. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 755. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 755. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 690 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 5, 2, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    52 x 0 + 3 x 1 + 69 x 5 + 9 x 2 + 97 x 4\n    which is 754 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 755. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 5, 0, 0, 5]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 5, 0, 4, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 5, 0, 1, 5]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 5, 0, 1, 5]\n\n    What is your action?

In deciding my initial offer (which tells Player 2 what I would give them, with the remainder going to me), I want to pick a division that leaves me a safe margin above 843 while not \u201cover\u2010dishing\u201d out my items to Player 2 (which might lead them to reject, thinking they can do better).\n\nI value the items differently. The highest\u2010valued ones for me are item2 (99 per unit), item1 (97) and item4 (90). I prefer to keep these and try to offer away the lower\u2013value items (item3 at 41 and item5 at 18). One natural idea is to \u201cclaim\u201d all of item1 and item4 and almost all of item2 for myself\u2014and offer away item3 and item5 fully. Since there are 5 units of item2, I can, for example, give up just 1 unit of item2 (worth 99 to me) while keeping 4 units (worth 396).\n\nLet\u2019s check what that would yield:\n\u2003\u2022 I keep all of item1: 2\u00d797 = 194  \n\u2003\u2022 I keep 4 out of 5 of item2: 4\u00d799 = 396  \n\u2003\u2022 I give away all of item3: 2\u00d741 = 82  \n\u2003\u2022 I keep all of item4: 4\u00d790 = 360  \n\u2003\u2022 I give away all of item5: 8\u00d718 = 144  \nThen my \u201ckept bundle\u201d is valued at: 194 + 396 + 360 = 950  \nand the bundle I offer to Player 2 is valued (using my numbers) as: 99 + 82 + 144 = 325.\n\nThis division gives me a safe margin above my outside offer (950 > 843) and leaves Player 2 a package that might be attractive if their private values make items 3 and 5 (or even a unit of item2) valuable. (Of course I do not know Player 2\u2019s preferences, so this is an initial opening offer that is strategically quite aggressive in my favor.)\n\nThe division is represented as a list of 5 numbers (one per item type) indicating the units I offer to Player 2:\n\u2003\u2022 item1: 0 (I keep both)\n\u2003\u2022 item2: 1 (I keep 4 out of 5)\n\u2003\u2022 item3: 2 (I give all)\n\u2003\u2022 item4: 0 (I keep all)\n\u2003\u2022 item5: 8 (I give all)\n\nThus, my initial offer is: [0, 1, 2, 0, 8].\n\nI now present my action.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 2, 0, 8]}",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 954. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 954. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 639 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 5, 0, 4, 8] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    45 x 1 + 68 x 5 + 27 x 0 + 4 x 4 + 69 x 8\n    which is 953 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 954. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 2, 0, 8]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 2, 0, 8]\n\n    What is your action?

For instance, one way to get a deal that just beats my reservation (with my raw value reaching around 861, which discounted gives about 844) is to give up most of the low\u2010value items (items with low per\u2010unit values) and part of a couple of other items.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 790. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1089 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [6, 2, 0, 2, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    77 x 6 + 70 x 2 + 39 x 0 + 91 x 2 + 86 x 0\n    which is 784 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 790. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Player 1's initial offer indicates they might value item 4 highly (since they kept more of it), so by giving up item 3 (low value to me) and keeping all of item 4, I'm creating a potentially acceptable trade while securing my high-value items.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 1, 1, 0, 0]}",

Given that the current offer gives a high value (\u2248319.48) compared to my outside option (200) and that further negotiation only adds risk with minimal discount deterioration (\u03b3=0.98), the best course is to ACCEPT the current offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

In our case item2 (5 per unit) and item4 (23 per unit) are our \u201ccheap\u201d items. We can then offer only a small slice of one of the remaining items (say, one unit of item3) in an effort to sweeten the deal.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [6, 5, 3, 3, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    65 x 6 + 75 x 5 + 7 x 3 + 47 x 3 + 40 x 4\n    which is 1087 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1088. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

I want to propose an initial offer that \u201cprices\u2010in\u201d the trade\u2013that is, it gives Player 2 an immediate proposal that (in expectation) is at least as attractive as what their outside option or a later, discounted counteroffer might yield while leaving me with as much of the total (my privately\u2010valued) value as possible. My private value for the 5 types of items (with available amounts [5, 2, 8, 2, 7]) is:\n\n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 1: 58 per unit  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 2: 63 per unit  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 3: 74 per unit  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 4: 56 per unit  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 5: 28 per unit\n\nIf I \u201ctook\u201d all items, my total value would be 1316. However, my outside option is 615.  \nI also know that Player 2\u2019s private values per item are uniformly drawn from 1 to 101 \u2013 so on average about 51 per unit. (For example, if Player 2 got all items, his expected value would be approximately 24 \u00d7 51 \u2248 1224, with a consequent outside offer drawn uniformly in [1, 1224] whose mean is about 612.) Thus, to get an immediate deal in round 1 (with no discounting), I want to offer him a share that in expectation nets him roughly as much as his reservation.  \n\nI try to \u201cget my cake\u201d while \u201cleaving some cake\u201d for him. I\u2019d like to keep most of the high\u2010value items for myself. For me the highest \u201cbang for my buck\u201d is item 3 (74 per unit) and next items 2 and 1. Items where I am less eager are those for which my private value is relatively lower, namely item 5 (28 per unit) and item 4 (56 per unit). So a reasonable idea is to concede fully on item 5 and partly on one of the other ones not so crucial to me (or where I have only mild competitive value) to give Player 2 enough expected value to make the offer attractive.  \n\nA candidate offer I considered is to let Player 2 have:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 1: 3 units (so I keep 2 units, gaining 2 \u00d7 58 = 116 for item 1)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 2: 2 units (giving him full control over the 2 units; I get 0 here)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 3: 0 units (since these are my highest\u2010valued, I want to keep all 8 units for myself, i.e., 8 \u00d7 74 = 592)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 4: 1 unit (so I get the other unit; 1 \u00d7 56 = 56 for me)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 5: 7 units (I concede completely on item 5, as my value is low; so he gets all 7, worth roughly 7 \u00d7 51 = 357 in expectation)\n\nIf we add my share of value then:\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 116  \n\u2003\u2003Item 2: 0  \n\u2003\u2003Item 3: 592  \n\u2003\u2003Item 4: 56  \n\u2003\u2003Item 5: 0  \nfor a total of 764 for me\u2014comfortably above my own outside offer of 615.\n\nAnd for Player 2, the \u201cexpected\u201d value (if his per\u2010unit values are roughly 51 on average) is approximately:\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 3 \u00d7 51 = 153  \n\u2003\u2003Item 2: 2 \u00d7 51 = 102  \n\u2003\u2003Item 3: 0  \n\u2003\u2003Item 4: 1 \u00d7 51 = 51  \n\u2003\u2003Item 5: 7 \u00d7 51 = 357  \nTotaling about 153 + 102 + 51 + 357 = 663\n\nThus, in expectation (and taking into account the possibility of discounting if negotiations run longer), this offer should be attractive to Player 2 relative to waiting for an outside option (whose \u201cexpected\u201d value is roughly 612) or a future counteroffer discounted by gamma (=0.98). It also leaves me with a significant surplus above my reservation payoff.\n\nI now propose this initial offer in round 1.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 2, 0, 1, 7]}",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 0, 2, 2, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    67 x 5 + 37 x 0 + 8 x 2 + 80 x 2 + 4 x 6\n    which is 535 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 536. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Reasoning:\n1. We first note our totals and personal values. The items available are:\n\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 3 units (value 71 each)\n\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 3 units (value 29 each)\n\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 1 unit (value 41)\n\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 4 units (value 31 each)\n\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 2 units (value 57 each)\n\u2003My total value if I got everything is 579. My private outside offer is 365, so any deal must make me noticeably better off (ideally >365) if I agree now.\n\n2. Because our actions are simultaneous in the sense that I make the first offer in round 1 (without any offer on the table yet) and both sides have outside options, I want to propose a division that gives Player 2 at least what we expect from their private offer while leaving me a margin above my fallback.\n\u2003For an unknown opponent whose per\u2010unit values are drawn uniformly from 1 to 101 the expected value per unit is about 51. Thus, if we roughly \u201csplit\u201d items by count, note that the total number of units is 13. A split by count would be about 6 and 7 units to the two players. However, because our value functions differ we want to give the opponent the items they are likely to \u201cvalue more\u201d on average.\n\n3. Looking at our values versus the estimated opponent\u2019s average:\n\u2003\u2013 Item 1: I value highly (71) compared to an average of ~51, so I try to keep these.\n\u2003\u2013 Items 2 and 4: I value them less (29 and 31) than the opponent\u2019s expected ~51.\n\u2003\u2013 Item 3 (only one unit) and Item 5 (I value them at 41 and 57, respectively): item 3 is borderline (41 < 51) so it might be more attractive to the opponent, while I have a slight edge on item 5.\n4. Constructing a division that gives me just a bit more than my fallback:\n\u2003I aim for around 368 in my subjective value, which is slightly above my fallback of 365. One way is to take:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 All of Item 1 (3 units): 3\u00d771 = 213\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 All of Item 5 (2 units): 2\u00d757 = 114\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 The lone unit of Item 3: 1\u00d741 = 41\n\u2003That sums to 213 + 114 + 41 = 368.\n\u2003Then, I offer Player 2 the remainder:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Items 2 (all 3 units) and Item 4 (all 4 units); total count = 7 units.\n\u2003Under the assumption that the opponent\u2019s expected per\u2010unit value is ~51, this gives them an expected value of 7\u00d751 \u2248 357, which roughly beats an average outside offer (and is good enough for them to consider an early agreement).\n\n5. My initial offer is communicated as the list of numbers for the quantities of items I am offering to Player 2. In our ordering (item 1 through 5), this means:\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 0 units,\n\u2003\u2003Item 2: 3 units,\n\u2003\u2003Item 3: 0 units,\n\u2003\u2003Item 4: 4 units,\n\u2003\u2003Item 5: 0 units.\n\u2003This leaves me with:\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 3,\u2003Item 2: 0,\u2003Item 3: 1,\u2003Item 4: 0,\u2003Item 5: 2,\nwhich yields my total value of 368. \n\nGiven that this division gives me a small but positive gain over my fallback while offering the opponent a competitive expected payoff, I will make this offer in round 1.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 0, 4, 0]}",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 2, 0, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    24 x 3 + 17 x 2 + 51 x 0 + 92 x 0 + 96 x 1\n    which is 202 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 205. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 3, 0, 4, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 3, 0, 4, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "I need to analyze this offer and decide on my response. Let me work through the problem systematically.\n\n### 1) Current Situation Analysis\n- My outside offer value: 205\n- My private values per unit: \n  - Item 1: 24\n  - Item 2: 17\n  - Item 3: 51\n  - Item 4: 92\n  - Item 5: 96\n- Total pool of items: [3, 3, 1, 4, 2]\n- Discount factor: 0.98 (reduces value in later rounds)\n\n### 2) Value Assessment\n\nFirst, let me evaluate Player 1's current offer to me:\n- I receive: [0, 3, 0, 4, 0]\n- I keep: [3, 0, 1, 0, 2]\n\nValue calculation for what I keep:\n- 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72\n- 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 17 = 0\n- 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 51 = 51\n- 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 92 = 0\n- 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 96 = 192\n- Total value = 72 + 0 + 51 + 0 + 192 = 315\n\nValue calculation for what I'm offered:\n- 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 24 = 0\n- 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51\n- 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 51 = 0\n- 4 units of item 4 = 4 \u00d7 92 = 368\n- 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 96 = 0\n- Total value = 0 + 51 + 0 + 368 + 0 = 419\n\nThis means in total this offer gives me a value of 419 - significantly higher than my outside offer of 205.\n\n### 3) Decision Making\n\nLooking at Player 1's offer, they want to keep:\n- All of items 1, 3, and 5\n- None of items 2 and 4\n\nThis suggests Player 1 values items 1, 3, and 5 more than items 2 and 4. I value items 4 and 5 the most (92 and 96), and item 3 moderately (51), with items 1 and 2 valued lower (24 and 17).\n\nSince the current offer gives me all of item 4 (which I value highly) and all of item 2 (which I value less), it's actually quite favorable to me.

                    "response": "Step\u2010by\u2010step reasoning:\n1. We know that there are 5 item types with supplies [5, 2, 4, 2, 1]. In any offer the items \u201cgiven\u201d to Player\u202f2 (the list we propose) are removed from my share; I get whatever remains.\n2. My private per\u2010unit values are: item\u202f1: 46; item\u202f2: 33; item\u202f3: 3; item\u202f4: 99; item\u202f5: 85. Hence my total value if I got everything would be 5\u00d746 + 2\u00d733 + 4\u00d73 + 2\u00d799 + 1\u00d785 = 591. My outside option is 120.\n3. I also know that Player\u202f2\u2019s private values are drawn uniformly from 1 to 101 so that on average each unit is \u201cworth\u201d about 51 to them. (The exact numbers will vary, and their outside option is a draw on [1, their total].) Their expected total \u201cbasket\u2010value\u201d is about 714, so their expected outside offer is roughly half that\u2014around 357.\n4. In bargaining problems it is common to try to \u201cjust beat\u201d the opponent\u2019s disagreement value while keeping as much surplus as possible. I note that for some items my valuation is much higher than the opponent\u2019s likely value and vice\u2010versa. In particular:\n\u2003\u2013 For item\u202f4 and item\u202f5 my values (99 and 85) are high, so I want to keep these.\n\u2003\u2013 For item\u202f2 my value (33) is lower than the opponent\u2019s estimated per\u2011unit average (\u224851), so I want to be generous here.\n\u2003\u2013 For item\u202f3 my value is very low (3) so even if the opponent highly prizes it (typical unit value \u224851) I can \u201cafford\u201d to give all units to Player\u202f2.\n\u2003\u2013 For item\u202f1 (my value 46 vs. opponent average 51) I have a slight margin, so I may concede only a modest number.\n5. With this in mind, one strategy is to design an offer that \u201cbalances\u201d the estimated values. For example, one candidate is to offer Player\u202f2:\n\u2003\u2022 2 out of the 5 units of item\u202f1 (leaving me with 3),\n\u2003\u2022 1 out of 2 units of item\u202f2 (a near\u2010split),\n\u2003\u2022 all 4 units of item\u202f3 (since they are worth almost nothing to me but can be worth a lot to Player\u202f2),\n\u2003\u2022 0 of item\u202f4 (I\u2019d prefer to keep both units given my high value for them),\n\u2003\u2022 0 of item\u202f5.\n6. Under this candidate offer (expressed as the list [2, 1, 4, 0, 0]), the implied allocations are:\n\u2003\u2013 For Player 2: items = [2, 1, 4, 0, 0]; the estimated expected value (using 51 per unit) is roughly 2\u00d751 + 1\u00d751 + 4\u00d751 = 102 + 51 + 204 = 357, which is around their expected outside option.\n\u2003\u2013 For me (Player 1): my share is the remainder \u2013 [3, 1, 0, 2, 1]. My actual value is 3\u00d746 + 1\u00d733 + 0\u00d73 + 2\u00d799 + 1\u00d785 = 138 + 33 + 0 + 198 + 85 = 454.\n7. This split gives me a large share of the value while \u201cjust barely\u201d giving Player 2 an amount that on average would match their fallback. (Of course, Player 2\u2019s actual private numbers can differ, but with no further information this is a reasonable first\u2010round proposal.) \n8. As we are in round 1 (with no discount penalty yet) and I must act as the first mover, I choose to propose the division in the \u201ccounteroffer\u201d format (i.e. the list shows what I give to Player\u202f2).\n\nBased on the above reasoning, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 4, 0, 0]}",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 460. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 460. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 741 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 1, 3, 2, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    4 x 3 + 25 x 1 + 59 x 3 + 86 x 2 + 73 x 1\n    which is 459 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 460. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 4, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 4, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?
