By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 4, 6, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    53 x 2 + 91 x 4 + 42 x 6 + 9 x 1 + 37 x 3\n    which is 842 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 843. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [4, 2, 3, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [4, 2, 3, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 843. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 696 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 4, 6, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    53 x 2 + 91 x 4 + 42 x 6 + 9 x 1 + 37 x 3\n    which is 842 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 843. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [4, 2, 3, 1, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 1, 2, 1, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [3, 1, 2, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 1, 2, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\n1) **Current Situation Analysis:**\n\n*   **Outside Offer Value:** 843\n*   **Item Values:** Item 1: 53, Item 2: 91, Item 3: 42, Item 4: 9, Item 5: 37\n*   **Total Items:** Item 1: 8, Item 2: 4, Item 3: 6, Item 4: 3, Item 5: 5\n*   **Discount Factor:** gamma = 0.98. This means accepting an offer in a later round is slightly less valuable than accepting the same offer in an earlier round.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** Player 1 is offering me [3, 1, 2, 1, 1]. This means I would get:\n    *   Item 1: 3 units (Player 1 offers)\n    *   Item 2: 1 units (Player 1 offers)\n    *   Item 3: 2 units (Player 1 offers)\n    *   Item 4: 1 units (Player 1 offers)\n    *   Item 5: 1 units (Player 1 offers)\n    \n    I would keep:\n    *   Item 1: 8 - 3 = 5 units\n    *   Item 2: 4 - 1 = 3 units\n    *   Item 3: 6 - 2 = 4 units\n    *   Item 4: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n    *   Item 5: 5 - 1 = 4 units\n    \n    My value if I accept:\n    (5 * 53) + (3 * 91) + (4 * 42) + (2 * 9) + (4 * 37) = 265 + 273 + 168 + 18 + 148 = 872\n\n*   **Comparison to Outside Offer:** The current offer (872) is greater than my outside offer (843).\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** Before accepting, I need to evaluate if a better offer is possible. Consider matching the last offer Player 2 gave in the previous round, which was [3, 1, 2, 1, 1]. If Player 1 is now offering this, it means that they must have thought they could get something even better from the current negotiation.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\nThe current offer (872) is greater than my outside offer (843). Accepting now guarantees me a value of 872, which is more than my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 272. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player2, 2 units of each item (keeping 1 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 843 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 0, 0, 3, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 0, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 0, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\nThe current offer on the table gives me:\n- 1 unit of item 1\n- 0 units of item 2\n- 0 units of item 3\n- 1 unit of item 4\n- 1 unit of item 5\n\nMy values for these items are:\n- Item 1: 7\n- Item 2: 61\n- Item 3: 73\n- Item 4: 58\n- Item 5: 82\n\nSo, the value of the current offer to me is:\n(1 * 7) + (0 * 61) + (0 * 73) + (1 * 58) + (1 * 82) = 7 + 0 + 0 + 58 + 82 = 147\n\nNow, we need to consider the discount factor. Since it's round 2, the discount factor is 0.98^(2-1) = 0.98.\nSo, the present value of the current offer is 147 * 0.98 = 144.06\n\nMy outside offer is 272. Since 144.06 < 272, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. I need to offer Player 2 something that they will accept, but also gives me a value greater than 272 (after discounting). It's tricky to know Player 2's values, but I know their first offer was [1, 0, 0, 1, 1]. This suggests they don't value these items highly relative to the other items I have.\n\nLet's try to make a counteroffer that's slightly more generous to them than their initial offer to me but still heavily favors me.  I will offer them [2, 0, 0, 2, 2].\n\nIf I offer Player 2 [2, 0, 0, 2, 2], I get to keep:\n- 4 units of item 1\n- 0 units of item 2\n- 1 unit of item 3\n- 4 units of item 4\n- 4 units of item 5\n\nThe value of this offer to me is:\n(4 * 7) + (0 * 61) + (1 * 73) + (4 * 58) + (4 * 82) = 28 + 0 + 73 + 232 + 328 = 661\n\nThe discounted value is 661 * 0.98 = 647.78. This is significantly better than my outside option.\n\nTherefore, I will make a counteroffer of [2, 0, 0, 2, 2].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 0, 2, 2]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 0, 0, 2, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    74 x 5 + 35 x 0 + 6 x 0 + 36 x 2 + 26 x 5\n    which is 572 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 574. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 0, 0, 3, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 0, 1, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 0, 2, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 0, 0, 2, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

This means an offer accepted in the next round is worth 98% of its current value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [2, 0, 0, 2, 2].  This means I would receive 2 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5. My value would be: (2 * 74) + (0 * 35) + (0 * 6) + (2 * 36) + (2 * 26) = 148 + 0 + 0 + 72 + 52 = 272.\n   - This value of 272 is significantly less than my outside offer of 574.  Therefore, accepting this offer would be a mistake.\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** I want to find an offer that is better than my outside offer.  Let's start by considering the maximum value I could get. That would be keeping all the items for myself.\n   - Keeping all items: (6 * 74) + (0 * 35) + (1 * 6) + (6 * 36) + (6 * 26) = 444 + 0 + 6 + 216 + 156 = 822.\n\n   I need to offer enough to Player 1 that they would accept, but not so much that I fall below my outside offer value. Let's try to find a counteroffer where I get at least my outside offer of 574.\n\n   To get at least 574, I can calculate what I can give away: 822 (total value) - 574 (outside offer) = 248. I need to give items to Player 1 that have a value to me of no more than 248.\n\n   Let's consider a potential counteroffer, giving them [4, 0, 1, 4, 4]. This means I keep [2, 0, 0, 2, 2]. The value to me of [2, 0, 0, 2, 2] is, as calculated above, 272, which is worse than my outside offer.\n\n   Let's consider another counteroffer, giving them [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This is a bad move. Let's give them [1, 0, 0, 1, 1]. I keep [5, 0, 1, 5, 5]. The value to me is (5 * 74) + (0 * 35) + (1 * 6) + (5 * 36) + (5 * 26) = 370 + 0 + 6 + 180 + 130 = 686.\n   This is greater than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - Accepting the current offer is worse than my outside offer.\n   - Walking away guarantees my outside offer.\n   - A counteroffer of giving Player 1 [1, 0, 0, 1, 1] gives me a value of 686, which is better than my outside offer of 574.\n\nSo, I'll make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 1, 1]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 0, 0, 2, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    74 x 5 + 35 x 0 + 6 x 0 + 36 x 2 + 26 x 5\n    which is 572 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 574. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 0, 0, 3, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 0, 1, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 0, 2, 2]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 0, 1, 1]\nRound 3: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 0, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\n1) **Current Situation:**\n    - My outside offer value is 574.\n    - My item values are: item 1 = 74, item 2 = 35, item 3 = 6, item 4 = 36, item 5 = 26.\n    - Total items: 6 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 6 of item 4, 6 of item 5.\n    - Discount factor: 0.98. This round is round 3, so the discount factor to apply is 0.98^(3-1) = 0.98^2 = 0.9604\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n    - Current offer: Player 1 is offering me [1, 0, 0, 1, 1]. This means I would receive 1 unit of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5. My value for this offer is:\n        (1 * 74) + (0 * 35) + (0 * 6) + (1 * 36) + (1 * 26) = 74 + 0 + 0 + 36 + 26 = 136\n    Taking into account the discount factor, the actual value of this offer is 136*0.9604 = 130.61\n\n3) **Alternative Offers:**\n    If I reject Player 1's offer, since this is the last round, I am treated as walking away.\n\n**Decision:**\nThe value of accepting the current offer is 130.61. My outside offer is 574.\nSince 130.61 < 574, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\nTherefore, I should walk away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 2, 3, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

The current offer on the table from Player 2 is very bad for me. Player 1's initial offer was giving player 2 [2, 1, 2, 3, 3]. So this means Player 1 gets [1, 0, 1, 2, 2]. My value if this happened would be:\n(1 * 10) + (0 * 72) + (1 * 2) + (2 * 30) + (2 * 48) = 10 + 0 + 2 + 60 + 96 = 168. 168*0.98 = 164.64. So this would be better than walking away.\n\nLet's see what offer I can make that will give me better than my outside offer.\n\nLet's try to offer player 2 an equal split of the items.\n\nItem 1: Give Player 2 1 unit.\nItem 2: Give Player 2 0 units.\nItem 3: Give Player 2 1 unit.\nItem 4: Give Player 2 2 unit.\nItem 5: Give Player 2 2 unit.\n\nThis leaves me with:\nItem 1: 2 units\nItem 2: 1 unit\nItem 3: 2 units\nItem 4: 3 units\nItem 5: 3 units\n\nMy value: (2 * 10) + (1 * 72) + (2 * 2) + (3 * 30) + (3 * 48) = 20 + 72 + 4 + 90 + 144 = 330\n\nDiscounted value: 330 * 0.98 = 323.4.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 1, 0, 5, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    81 x 3 + 28 x 1 + 30 x 0 + 87 x 5 + 17 x 4\n    which is 774 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 775. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 2, 3, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 1, 2, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 1, 2, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the optimal action.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** 775\n*   **Item values:** Item 1: 81, Item 2: 28, Item 3: 30, Item 4: 87, Item 5: 17\n*   **Total items:** Item 1: 3, Item 2: 1, Item 3: 3, Item 4: 5, Item 5: 5\n*   **Discount factor:** 0.98. This means an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 0.98 times the value of an offer in round 2.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 0, 1, 2, 2]. This means I would receive:\n    *   Item 1: 1\n    *   Item 2: 0\n    *   Item 3: 1\n    *   Item 4: 2\n    *   Item 5: 2\n\n    My value for this offer is: (1 * 81) + (0 * 28) + (1 * 30) + (2 * 87) + (2 * 17) = 81 + 0 + 30 + 174 + 34 = 319\n\n    Since 319 is much less than my outside offer of 775, accepting this offer would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**\n\n    Let's consider a scenario where I offer Player 1 the minimum possible to make me at least indifferent between accepting and walking away. That means my total value should be at least 775.\n\n    Let x1, x2, x3, x4, and x5 represent the number of items 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 I give to Player 1, respectively. Then I keep:\n    Item 1: 3 - x1\n    Item 2: 1 - x2\n    Item 3: 3 - x3\n    Item 4: 5 - x4\n    Item 5: 5 - x5\n\n    My value would be: 81(3-x1) + 28(1-x2) + 30(3-x3) + 87(5-x4) + 17(5-x5) >= 775\n\n    Simplifying: 243 - 81x1 + 28 - 28x2 + 90 - 30x3 + 435 - 87x4 + 85 - 17x5 >= 775\n    881 - 81x1 - 28x2 - 30x3 - 87x4 - 17x5 >= 775\n    81x1 + 28x2 + 30x3 + 87x4 + 17x5 <= 106\n\n    We need to find a combination of x1, x2, x3, x4, and x5 (where x1 <= 3, x2 <= 1, x3 <= 3, x4 <= 5, x5 <= 5) that satisfies this inequality.\n\n    Let's start by setting x4=1 since item 4 has the highest value and we want to give away as little value as possible.  Let's also keep x1, x2, x3, and x5 at 0:\n    81(0) + 28(0) + 30(0) + 87(1) + 17(0) = 87\n    Since 87 <= 106, this seems promising.\n    Since we want to maximize what we get and we've only given away 87 in value so far, let's try increasing x1:\n    81(1) + 28(0) + 30(0) + 87(1) + 17(0) = 81 + 87 = 168\n    That is too much.\n    Let's instead try increasing x5:\n    81(0) + 28(0) + 30(0) + 87(1) + 17(1) = 87 + 17 = 104.\n    Since 104 <= 106, this is a possible counteroffer. We can barely give away anything else. Let's make this offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is unacceptable.\n*   Walking away would guarantee my outside offer of 775.\n*   A counteroffer of [0, 0, 0, 1, 1] seems like the most I can give without going below 775. It leaves me with a value of 881 - 104 = 777. This is better than the outside offer. This offer maximizes what I keep while giving the smallest amount to player 1.\n\n**Final Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 648. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player2, 2 units of each item (keeping 1 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 918 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's start by considering my options. I can walk away and get my outside offer of 648. Or I can make a counteroffer. Since this is round 1, I should aim for a beneficial split, giving Player 2 just enough to be better off than their (unknown) outside offer.\n\nTo start, let's assume I keep everything and offer Player 2 nothing. This gives me a value of (4 * 60) + (1 * 40) + (6 * 61) + (1 * 68) + (2 * 77) = 240 + 40 + 366 + 68 + 154 = 868. This is greater than my outside offer of 648.\n\nNow, I need to offer Player 2 enough to make them consider accepting. Without knowing their values, it's difficult. I'll start by offering a small amount of each item, ensuring it's not too costly for me. Let's try offering Player 2 one unit of each item.\n\nThis would give me:\nItem 1: 3 * 60 = 180\nItem 2: 0 * 40 = 0\nItem 3: 5 * 61 = 305\nItem 4: 0 * 68 = 0\nItem 5: 1 * 77 = 77\nTotal value = 180 + 0 + 305 + 0 + 77 = 562\n\nThis is less than my outside offer of 648. Let's consider offering a different split. I will aim to get at least 648 in round 1.\n\nTo get closer to my outside offer, I need to retain more valuable items for myself. I'll offer Player 2 1 unit of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 0 unit of item 5.\nValue of my holding:\nItem 1: 3 * 60 = 180\nItem 2: 1 * 40 = 40\nItem 3: 5 * 61 = 305\nItem 4: 1 * 68 = 68\nItem 5: 2 * 77 = 154\nTotal Value: 180 + 40 + 305 + 68 + 154 = 747\n\nThis is above my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 6, 1, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    20 x 0 + 16 x 0 + 14 x 6 + 42 x 1 + 53 x 2\n    which is 232 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 233. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\n1) **Current Situation:**\n\n   - My outside offer value: 233\n   - Item values: item 1 = 20, item 2 = 16, item 3 = 14, item 4 = 42, item 5 = 53\n   - Total items: 4 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 6 of item 3, 1 of item 4, 2 of item 5\n   - Discount factor: 0.98. This means that an offer in round 2 is worth 0.98 times the value in round 1, and an offer in round 3 is worth 0.98^2 times the value in round 1.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer:** I am offered [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]. This means I get 1 unit of item 1 and 1 unit of item 3. My value for this offer is (1 * 20) + (1 * 14) = 34. This is significantly less than my outside offer of 233.\n   - **Potential counteroffers:**  I need to keep enough items to reach a value greater than 233. Let's explore some scenarios.\n\n    To avoid making Mistake 2, any counteroffer I propose must result in a value for me that is greater than my outside offer of 233.\n\n    If I keep all the items, the total value is (4 * 20) + (1 * 16) + (6 * 14) + (1 * 42) + (2 * 53) = 80 + 16 + 84 + 42 + 106 = 328.\n    If I give away all of item 1, my total value becomes 328 - 80 = 248\n    If I give away all of item 1 and 1 unit of item 5, my value becomes 328 - 80 - 53 = 195, which is less than my outside offer.\n\n    To begin, I'll make a counteroffer that favors me significantly, but leaves the other player with something. I'll offer [1, 0, 1, 0, 0] which is the same as what they offered. This might seem odd, but I want to see their reaction.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\nSince the current offer is much worse than my outside offer, I should not accept it (avoiding Mistake 4). I also should not walk away yet since there are more rounds to negotiate (avoiding Mistake 5).\n\nTherefore, I will make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]}\n```",

For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 6, 1, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    20 x 0 + 16 x 0 + 14 x 6 + 42 x 1 + 53 x 2\n    which is 232 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 233. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 2, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 0, 2, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value is 233.\n*   My values for the items are: item 1 = 20, item 2 = 16, item 3 = 14, item 4 = 42, item 5 = 53.\n*   The total pool of items is: 4 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 2 units of item 5.\n*   The discount factor is 0.98. This means that accepting an offer in a later round is slightly less valuable than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [2, 0, 2, 0, 0]. This means I would receive 2 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5. My value for this offer is: (2 * 20) + (0 * 16) + (2 * 14) + (0 * 42) + (0 * 53) = 40 + 0 + 28 + 0 + 0 = 68.\n\n    *   Compare to outside offer: 68 is much less than my outside offer of 233.\n*   **Possible counteroffers:** I need to make a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 233. I currently have the option of offering [2, 0, 2, 0, 0] to player 1, which leaves me with [2, 1, 4, 1, 2]. The value of keeping this is: (2 * 20) + (1 * 16) + (4 * 14) + (1 * 42) + (2 * 53) = 40 + 16 + 56 + 42 + 106 = 260. This is better than the outside offer. Let's see if we can improve on it for both sides.\n    In the previous round, both players offered [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]. Now, player 1 is offering [2, 0, 2, 0, 0].\n\n    If I offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] to Player 1, I would keep [4, 1, 6, 1, 2], which has a value of 4*20 + 1*16 + 6*14 + 1*42 + 2*53 = 80 + 16 + 84 + 42 + 106 = 328.\n    If I offered [4, 1, 6, 1, 2] to Player 1, I would keep [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], which has a value of 0.\n    Let's try to find a split that's mutually beneficial. I value items 4 and 5 the highest.\n    Let's try offering [2, 0, 4, 0, 0] to Player 1. That leaves me with [2, 1, 2, 1, 2]. My value is 2*20 + 1*16 + 2*14 + 1*42 + 2*53 = 40 + 16 + 28 + 42 + 106 = 232. This is still below my outside offer, so this is not a valid offer for me.\n    I need to offer Player 1 less.\n\n    How about offering [1, 0, 2, 0, 0] to Player 1. That leaves me with [3, 1, 4, 1, 2]. My value is 3*20 + 1*16 + 4*14 + 1*42 + 2*53 = 60 + 16 + 56 + 42 + 106 = 280. This is pretty good.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer of [2, 0, 2, 0, 0] is terrible for me. It's much lower than my outside offer.\nOffering [1, 0, 2, 0, 0] gets me 280, which is better than my outside offer of 233.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 2, 0, 0]}\n```",

I want to maximize my expected payoff, considering the possibility of Player 2 accepting, making a counteroffer, or walking away. I also have to consider the discount factor in later rounds.\n\nA good starting point is to consider a \"fair\" split, or perhaps a split that gives Player 2 slightly more than half the value, in the hopes of getting them to accept quickly. Let's aim to offer Player 2 a deal that gives them approximately half of the total value. Since I value the items differently, a fair offer isn't simply half of each item.\n\nTo determine a reasonable initial offer, I will aim to give player 2 a value close to 848.5 (half of the combined value of all items). However, since my outside offer is 1014, I should make sure that what I keep for myself is worth at least that much.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 9, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    5 x 0 + 24 x 1 + 97 x 0 + 76 x 9 + 71 x 3\n    which is 921 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 922. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

I should not accept.\n    - I could walk away, but it's only round 1, and there are more rounds of negotiation.\n    - I should make a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer.\n\nLet's construct a counteroffer. I need to keep enough items to have a value greater than 922. I should try to keep more of the items I value highly (item 3, item 4, item 5). Let's try keeping all of item 3 and most of items 4 and 5.\n\nCounteroffer 1: Offer [2, 4, 0, 4, 2] to Player 1.\nI keep: item 1 = 0, item 2 = 0, item 3 = 3, item 4 = 5, item 5 = 3\nMy value: 0*5 + 0*24 + 3*97 + 5*76 + 3*71 = 0 + 0 + 291 + 380 + 213 = 884. This is still less than 922.\n\nCounteroffer 2: Offer [2, 4, 0, 3, 1] to Player 1.\nI keep: item 1 = 0, item 2 = 0, item 3 = 3, item 4 = 6, item 5 = 4\nMy value: 0*5 + 0*24 + 3*97 + 6*76 + 4*71 = 0 + 0 + 291 + 456 + 284 = 1031. This is greater than 922.\n\nSo, I will offer [2, 4, 0, 3, 1].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 4, 0, 3, 1]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 9, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    5 x 0 + 24 x 1 + 97 x 0 + 76 x 9 + 71 x 3\n    which is 921 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 922. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 1, 4, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 4, 0, 3, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 0, 3, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 3, 0, 3, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

This means that accepting an offer in round 2 gives me 0.98 times the value of the offer, and accepting in round 3 gives me 0.98^2 times the value of the offer.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 3, 0, 3, 1]. This means I would receive 1 unit of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5. The value to me is:\n     (1 * 5) + (3 * 24) + (0 * 97) + (3 * 76) + (1 * 71) = 5 + 72 + 0 + 228 + 71 = 376\n     Since this is round 2, the discounted value is 376 * 0.98 = 368.48\n\n   - **Compare to outside offer:** 368.48 is significantly less than my outside offer of 922.\n\n   - **Consider a potential counteroffer:** I need to find an offer that gives me a value greater than 922. Let's consider keeping everything for myself and giving nothing to Player 1. My total value is:\n     (2 * 5) + (4 * 24) + (3 * 97) + (9 * 76) + (5 * 71) = 10 + 96 + 291 + 684 + 355 = 1436.\n     This is higher than my outside offer, so I should aim for something that leaves me with a value between 922 and 1436.\n\n     Let's evaluate Player 1's Round 1 offer to me of [1, 2, 1, 4, 2]. This means I keep [1, 2, 2, 5, 3]\n     My value is (1 * 5) + (2 * 24) + (2 * 97) + (5 * 76) + (3 * 71) = 5 + 48 + 194 + 380 + 213 = 840.\n     Discounted, that's 840 * 0.98 = 823.2\n\n     Let's evaluate Player 1's Round 2 offer to me of [1, 3, 0, 3, 1]. This means I keep [1, 1, 3, 6, 4]\n     My value is (1 * 5) + (1 * 24) + (3 * 97) + (6 * 76) + (4 * 71) = 5 + 24 + 291 + 456 + 284 = 1060.\n     Discounted, that's 1060 * 0.98 = 1038.8\n\n     Since I would like to get above my outside offer, I can try offering Player 1 what they offered me in the last round.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze this negotiation problem step by step.\n\nMy objective is to maximize my value, considering my private values for each item, the outside offer, and the discount factor. Since this is the first round, I should propose an offer that is likely to be accepted, considering my values and the total amounts of items available.\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\n1. **Calculate my total value:** This is already given as 1439.\n2. **Consider my outside option:** My outside option is 1106. Any deal I make must be worth at least this much after discounting.\n3. **Estimate Player 2's values:** I don't know Player 2's values, but I can assume they are drawn from the same distribution (1 to 101). A reasonable strategy is to offer Player 2 slightly more than half the total value assuming they value things roughly the same as me.\n4. **Formulate an initial offer:** My goal is to get a deal accepted as quickly as possible to minimize the impact of the discount factor.\n5. **Test offer with hypothetical example:** Let's consider giving player 2 approximately half the items. Given the item counts, let's look at an offer of [3, 4, 1, 2, 1]. This gives Player 2:\n    * 3 units of item 1\n    * 4 units of item 2\n    * 1 units of item 3\n    * 2 units of item 4\n    * 1 units of item 5\n\nThis leaves me with:\n    * 4 units of item 1\n    * 5 units of item 2\n    * 2 units of item 3\n    * 3 units of item 4\n    * 2 units of item 5\n\nMy value for what remains is:\n    * 4 * 71 = 284\n    * 5 * 40 = 200\n    * 2 * 99 = 198\n    * 3 * 30 = 90\n    * 2 * 45 = 90\n    * Total = 862\n\nSince 862 is significantly less than my outside offer of 1106, this is not a very good deal for me. I need to make an offer that leaves me with significantly more of the items I value, in order to beat my walk away offer. Let's start by offering the lowest possible amounts to Player 2, which are all zero. This would give me a value of 1439, however it is unlikely that player 2 would accept this deal.\n\nI will aim for an offer that is likely to be accepted, but also better than the previous example. My values are high for items 1 and 3, and lower for items 2, 4 and 5.\nI will offer [1, 4, 0, 2, 1] to Player 2.\nThis leaves me with:\n    * 6 units of item 1\n    * 5 units of item 2\n    * 3 units of item 3\n    * 3 units of item 4\n    * 2 units of item 5\n\nMy value is then:\n    * 6 * 71 = 426\n    * 5 * 40 = 200\n    * 3 * 99 = 297\n    * 3 * 30 = 90\n    * 2 * 45 = 90\n    * Total = 1103\n\nThis is slightly lower than my walk away offer. So, I should increase the amount I keep.\n\nNew Offer: [1, 5, 0, 3, 1] to Player 2.\nThis leaves me with:\n    * 6 units of item 1\n    * 4 units of item 2\n    * 3 units of item 3\n    * 2 units of item 4\n    * 2 units of item 5\n    * Total = (6 * 71) + (4 * 40) + (3 * 99) + (2 * 30) + (2 * 45) = 426 + 160 + 297 + 60 + 90 = 1033\n\nStill not above my walk away offer of 1106.\n\nFinal Offer: [0, 6, 0, 3, 1] to Player 2\nThis leaves me with:\n    * 7 units of item 1\n    * 3 units of item 2\n    * 3 units of item 3\n    * 2 units of item 4\n    * 2 units of item 5\n\nValue:\n    * 7 * 71 = 497\n    * 3 * 40 = 120\n    * 3 * 99 = 297\n    * 2 * 30 = 60\n    * 2 * 45 = 90\n\n    * Total = 497 + 120 + 297 + 60 + 90 = 1064\n\nStill not above my walk away offer of 1106.\n\nBest Offer: [0, 5, 0, 2, 1]\nThis leaves me with:\n    * 7 units of item 1\n    * 4 units of item 2\n    * 3 units of item 3\n    * 3 units of item 4\n    * 2 units of item 5\n\nValue:\n    * 7 * 71 = 497\n    * 4 * 40 = 160\n    * 3 * 99 = 297\n    * 3 * 30 = 90\n    * 2 * 45 = 90\n    * Total = 497 + 160 + 297 + 90 + 90 = 1134\n\nOkay, 1134 is a little above my outside offer and offers player 2 enough that they will hopefully consider it.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 5, 0, 2, 1]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 7, 1, 5, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    51 x 0 + 75 x 7 + 12 x 1 + 29 x 5 + 29 x 3\n    which is 769 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 770. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 5, 0, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 5, 0, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

My value = 3 * 77 = 231\nItem 2: 3 units.  My value = 3 * 62 = 186\nItem 3: 1 unit.   My value = 1 * 62 = 62\nItem 4: 1 unit.   My value = 1 * 72 = 72\nItem 5: 3.5 units.  My value = 3.5 * 44 = 154\nTotal value for myself if I offer Player 2 half of each item = 231 + 186 + 62 + 72 + 154 = 705\n\nThis is much less than my outside offer of 1080, so I need to offer Player 2 less items, and keep more for myself.\n\nLet's try offering these values to Player 2:\nItem 1: 1 unit. My value = 5 * 77 = 385\nItem 2: 1 unit. My value = 5 * 62 = 310\nItem 3: 0 unit. My value = 2 * 62 = 124\nItem 4: 0 unit. My value = 2 * 72 = 144\nItem 5: 1 unit. My value = 6 * 44 = 264\nTotal value to me = 385 + 310 + 124 + 144 + 264 = 1227\n\nThis is greater than my outside offer.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1169. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 894 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [6, 6, 1, 0, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    94 x 6 + 45 x 6 + 75 x 1 + 41 x 0 + 43 x 6\n    which is 1167 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1169. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 3, 7, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    52 x 0 + 79 x 2 + 100 x 3 + 3 x 7 + 10 x 3\n    which is 509 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 510. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 1, 3, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 3, 1, 3, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 510.\n   - My values for the items are: item 1: 52, item 2: 79, item 3: 100, item 4: 3, item 5: 10.\n   - The total pool of items is: item 1: 4, item 2: 8, item 3: 3, item 4: 7, item 5: 6.\n   - The discount factor is 0.98. This means an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.98 times its face value, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 0.98^2 times its face value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** I am offered [1, 3, 1, 3, 2]. This means Player 1 keeps:\n      - Item 1: 4 - 1 = 3\n      - Item 2: 8 - 3 = 5\n      - Item 3: 3 - 1 = 2\n      - Item 4: 7 - 3 = 4\n      - Item 5: 6 - 2 = 4\n   - My value for this offer is: (1 * 52) + (3 * 79) + (1 * 100) + (3 * 3) + (2 * 10) = 52 + 237 + 100 + 9 + 20 = 418.\n\n   - **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (418) is less than my outside offer (510).\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** Let's consider a few scenarios. To make things simple, let's aim for something close to an equal split *in value* initially. The total value of all items to me is (4 * 52) + (8 * 79) + (3 * 100) + (7 * 3) + (6 * 10) = 208 + 632 + 300 + 21 + 60 = 1221. Half of this value is approximately 610.5. So I want to keep items worth around 610.5.\n\n   - Let's start by offering Player 1 a fairly generous offer, close to half the total value. To get a value of approximately 610.5, I need to keep about 610.5 worth of items. A good starting point is giving away half of each item.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   - Accepting the current offer is worse than my outside offer.\n   - I need to formulate a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer to me.\n\nLet's propose a counteroffer that gives the other player the following: [2, 4, 1, 3, 3]\nMy values for what I keep are:\n2 units of item 1 = 2 * 52 = 104\n4 units of item 2 = 4 * 79 = 316\n2 units of item 3 = 2 * 100 = 200\n4 units of item 4 = 4 * 3 = 12\n3 units of item 5 = 3 * 10 = 30\nTotal value = 104 + 316 + 200 + 12 + 30 = 662\n\nThis is greater than my outside offer.\nNow let's offer player 1 a slightly better deal, since it is round 1:\n[1, 3, 1, 3, 2] offer a value of 418 to me\nSo let's offer them the following: [1, 3, 1, 3, 2]\n\nMy values for what I keep are:\n3 units of item 1 = 3 * 52 = 156\n5 units of item 2 = 5 * 79 = 395\n2 units of item 3 = 2 * 100 = 200\n4 units of item 4 = 4 * 3 = 12\n4 units of item 5 = 4 * 10 = 40\nTotal value = 156 + 395 + 200 + 12 + 40 = 803\n\nThis is better than my outside offer and better than what I was offered.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 3, 1, 3, 2]}\n```",

This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 1, 3, 4, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    15 x 3 + 77 x 1 + 62 x 3 + 46 x 4 + 6 x 1\n    which is 498 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 499. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 2, 2, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 0, 2, 2, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 499\n*   My values for items: Item 1: 15, Item 2: 77, Item 3: 62, Item 4: 46, Item 5: 6\n*   Total pool of items: 3 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 4 of item 4, 5 of item 5\n*   Discount factor: 0.98. This means accepting an offer later is slightly less valuable than accepting it now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [2, 0, 2, 2, 2]. This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 3 - 2 = 1\n    *   Item 2: 1 - 0 = 1\n    *   Item 3: 4 - 2 = 2\n    *   Item 4: 4 - 2 = 2\n    *   Item 5: 5 - 2 = 3\n    Value of current offer: (1 * 15) + (1 * 77) + (2 * 62) + (2 * 46) + (3 * 6) = 15 + 77 + 124 + 92 + 18 = 326\n\n    Comparing this value (326) to my outside offer (499), it's clear that accepting this offer would be a mistake.\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to find an offer that gives me a value greater than 499. Let's consider a scenario where I keep all of item 1, item 2 and item 3 for myself. I can then evaluate the remaining items (4 and 5).\n    *   keeping all of item 1,2,3 : 3*15 + 1*77 + 4*62 = 45 + 77 + 248 = 370\n    *   Remaining to make up 499: 499-370 = 129.\n    *   if I keep everything: 370 + 4*46 + 5*6 = 370+184+30 = 584 which is my total value of items. So I definitely need to give some items to player 1.\n    *   Let's try offering 1 unit of item 4: 370 + 3*46 + 5*6 = 370+138+30 = 538.\n    *   Let's try offering 2 units of item 4: 370 + 2*46 + 5*6 = 370+92+30 = 492.\n        *   In this case I am offering Player 1 [0,0,0,2,0]. Then my items value = 492 which is still less than 499.\n    *   Let's offer the entire item 5. 370 + 4*46 = 370+184=554. Offer Player 1 all of item 5.\n        *   In this case I am offering Player 1 [0,0,0,0,5]. My items value = 554\n    *   If I offer [1, 0, 1, 1, 3] to Player 1, this means I keep [2, 1, 3, 3, 2]. My value would be: 2*15 + 1*77 + 3*62 + 3*46 + 2*6 = 30 + 77 + 186 + 138 + 12 = 443. Too low.\n\n    Let's consider keeping only items 1 and 2, giving items 3, 4, and 5 to player 1. \n    * Keeping items 1 and 2 gives me: 3*15 + 1*77 = 45 + 77 = 122.\n    * Value needed: 499 - 122 = 377.\n    * Let's try something closer to my outside offer but reasonable: Let me offer Player 1 [1, 0, 2, 2, 3].\n        * That would mean I keep [2, 1, 2, 2, 2]\n        * 2*15 + 1*77 + 2*62 + 2*46 + 2*6 = 30 + 77 + 124 + 92 + 12 = 335\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is worse than my outside offer.\nI need to make a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer for myself.\nAfter trying various combinations, let's try an offer where I keep most of the valuable items and give some of the less valuable ones to Player 1.\nI will offer Player 1 [1, 0, 2, 2, 4], meaning I keep [2, 1, 2, 2, 1]. My value is:\n2*15 + 1*77 + 2*62 + 2*46 + 1*6 = 30 + 77 + 124 + 92 + 6 = 329\nLet me try offering Player 1 [0, 0, 1, 1, 4]. This means I keep [3, 1, 3, 3, 1].\nMy value is 3*15 + 1*77 + 3*62 + 3*46 + 1*6 = 45 + 77 + 186 + 138 + 6 = 452\n\nLet me try offering Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 1, 4]. This means I keep [3, 1, 4, 3, 1].\nMy value is 3*15 + 1*77 + 4*62 + 3*46 + 1*6 = 45 + 77 + 248 + 138 + 6 = 514.\nThis is a good starting point because 514 is greater than 499.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 1, 4]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [7, 3, 5, 2, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    59 x 7 + 78 x 3 + 89 x 5 + 69 x 2 + 9 x 5\n    which is 1275 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1282.

This means that accepting an offer later is slightly less valuable than accepting it now.\n\n2. **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer: [4, 1, 2, 1, 2] means I get 4 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n      - My value for the current offer: (4 * 59) + (1 * 78) + (2 * 89) + (1 * 69) + (2 * 9) = 236 + 78 + 178 + 69 + 18 = 579\n\n   - Since 579 < 1282, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\n   - Now let's consider a possible counteroffer.

However, I will start by making a somewhat fair offer and see how the other player reacts. Let's offer approximately half the value.\n\n   - Offer: [4, 1, 2, 1, 2] (The original offer)\n      - Value to me: (4 * 59) + (1 * 78) + (2 * 89) + (1 * 69) + (2 * 9) = 236 + 78 + 178 + 69 + 18 = 579\n   - Counteroffer:\n      - Offer: [3, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n      - Value to me: (5 * 59) + (2 * 78) + (4 * 89) + (1 * 69) + (4 * 9) = 295 + 156 + 356 + 69 + 36 = 912\n      - Offer: [2, 0, 1, 0, 1]\n      - Value to me: (6 * 59) + (3 * 78) + (4 * 89) + (2 * 69) + (4 * 9) = 354 + 234 + 356 + 138 + 36 = 1118\n      - Offer: [3, 0, 1, 0, 1]\n      - Value to me: (5 * 59) + (3 * 78) + (4 * 89) + (2 * 69) + (4 * 9) = 295 + 234 + 356 + 138 + 36 = 1059\n3. **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - I should not accept the current offer.\n   - I should not walk away.\n   - I should propose a counteroffer.\n\nOkay, I will propose a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer.\nTo get above 1282:\nOffer: [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] results in a value of 1275 for me.\nOffer: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] results in a value of 1334 for me.\nTherefore, to be safe and above my outside offer, the best I can do is to offer zero items to Player 1.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. It's round 2. Player 1 (me) initially offered [4, 1, 2, 1, 2] to Player 2. Player 2 responded with [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], meaning they want all the items. The current offer on the table is that I receive nothing: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. My outside offer is 1114.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of accepting the current offer:\n\n0 units of item 1 = 0 * 81 = 0\n0 units of item 2 = 0 * 16 = 0\n0 units of item 3 = 0 * 15 = 0\n0 units of item 4 = 0 * 67 = 0\n0 units of item 5 = 0 * 55 = 0\nTotal value = 0\n\nSince 0 is much less than my outside offer of 1114, accepting is not a good option.\n\nWalking away would give me my outside offer of 1114.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. I need to offer Player 2 something that they will accept, while still giving me a value greater than my discounted outside offer. Since this is round 2, the discount factor is 0.98^(2-1) = 0.98. Therefore, I need a final value of at least 1114/0.98 = 1136.73 to justify continuing.\n\nLet's try to construct a counteroffer that is slightly better than the midpoint. The total available items are [8, 3, 5, 2, 5]. Let's offer Player 2 slightly more than half of the items and see what remains for me. Let's start by offering [4, 1, 2, 1, 2] again.\n\nMy remaining items would be:\nItem 1: 8 - 4 = 4 units\nItem 2: 3 - 1 = 2 units\nItem 3: 5 - 2 = 3 units\nItem 4: 2 - 1 = 1 unit\nItem 5: 5 - 2 = 3 units\n\nValue to me:\n4 * 81 + 2 * 16 + 3 * 15 + 1 * 67 + 3 * 55 = 324 + 32 + 45 + 67 + 165 = 633\n\nSince 633 < 1136.73, this is not a great offer. Let's try making a more aggressive offer. We know that the total value of all items to me is 1180. I want to receive at least 1136.73 after discounting, so let's make an offer where I retain enough value. If I keep 50% of the total value, that's 590. So an offer where the other player gets less than 590 * 2 = 1180, is definitely not in my interest.\n\nLet's try to offer the Player close to nothing. The Player offered [0,0,0,0,0], maybe they really need an item 4. So how about I keep 7 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 1 of item 4 and 4 of item 5, and offer the remainder. That is offering [1, 1, 1, 1, 1].\n\nMy remaining items would be:\nItem 1: 8 - 1 = 7 units\nItem 2: 3 - 1 = 2 units\nItem 3: 5 - 1 = 4 units\nItem 4: 2 - 1 = 1 unit\nItem 5: 5 - 1 = 4 units\n\nValue to me:\n7 * 81 + 2 * 16 + 4 * 15 + 1 * 67 + 4 * 55 = 567 + 32 + 60 + 67 + 220 = 946\n\nThe value is only 946, so with the discount factor, 946 * 0.98 = 927.08, it's still way too low.\n\nThe other player clearly values item 4 highly. Let's offer Player 2 the following: [5, 2, 3, 2, 3]\n\nMy remaining items would be:\nItem 1: 8 - 5 = 3 units\nItem 2: 3 - 2 = 1 units\nItem 3: 5 - 3 = 2 units\nItem 4: 2 - 2 = 0 unit\nItem 5: 5 - 3 = 2 units\n\nValue to me:\n3 * 81 + 1 * 16 + 2 * 15 + 0 * 67 + 2 * 55 = 243 + 16 + 30 + 0 + 110 = 399\n\nThe value is only 399, so with the discount factor, 399 * 0.98 = 391.02, it's still way too low. Given that I'm not getting any traction and am already in round 2, it's time to walk away and take the outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 1, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    38 x 0 + 50 x 1 + 43 x 1 + 69 x 0 + 85 x 0\n    which is 93 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 95. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 2, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 2, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

This means accepting an offer in a later round is slightly less valuable than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 1, 1, 0, 1]. This means I get 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n\n    *   Value of current offer: (1 * 80) + (1 * 88) + (1 * 57) + (0 * 43) + (1 * 18) = 80 + 88 + 57 + 0 + 18 = 243\n    *   Since 243 > 35, accepting the current offer is better than walking away.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**  I want to find a counteroffer that is even better than 243 for me. It needs to leave enough items for Player 1 that they also find it preferable to their unknown outside offer. Let's consider some options. I have to give items to player 1.\n\n    *   **Consider offering [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]** This means keeping everything.

However, this will be rejected by player 1.\n    *   **Consider offering [2, 2, 2, 1, 1]** This means I get 4 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 5 of item 3, 3 of item 4, and 3 of item 5. The value is (4*80) + (4*88) + (5*57) + (3*43) + (3*18) = 320 + 352 + 285 + 129 + 54 = 1140.

The value is (3*80) + (3*88) + (4*57) + (2*43) + (2*18) = 240 + 264 + 228 + 86 + 36 = 854.

The value is (2*80) + (2*88) + (3*57) + (1*43) + (1*18) = 160 + 176 + 171 + 43 + 18 = 568.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1089. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player2, 2 units of each item (keeping 1 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 741 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 2, 2, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 2, 2, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\nThe current offer on the table is [2, 2, 2, 1, 1], which means I would receive:\n* Item 1: 6 - 2 = 4 units\n* Item 2: 6 - 2 = 4 units\n* Item 3: 7 - 2 = 5 units\n* Item 4: 4 - 1 = 3 units\n* Item 5: 4 - 1 = 3 units\n\nMy values for these items are: 66, 81, 8, 83, 9.\n\nSo, the value of the current offer to me is:\n(4 * 66) + (4 * 81) + (5 * 8) + (3 * 83) + (3 * 9) = 264 + 324 + 40 + 249 + 27 = 904\n\nSince this is round 2, I need to multiply this value by the discount factor gamma^(r-1) = 0.98^(2-1) = 0.98.\nDiscounted value of current offer = 904 * 0.98 = 885.92\n\nMy outside offer is 1089. Since 885.92 < 1089, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. I want to offer Player 2 just enough to make them accept, but I don't know their values. To do this accurately, I would need information on how Player 2 generated offers. In the absence of that, a general approach is to look at the previous offers made, and look for trends, and also what my values are.\n\nThe offer from Player 1 (me) was [1, 1, 1, 0, 1]\nThe counteroffer from Player 2 was [2, 2, 2, 1, 1]. This indicates that Player 2 wants more of everything.\nMy high value items are item 2 and item 4, while item 3 and item 5 are very low. Item 1 is moderate.\nLet's make a counteroffer. Let's try offering slightly more of the less valuable items to keep more of the items I value.\nI'll try offering: [1, 1, 2, 0, 1]\nThis gives me a value of (5*66) + (5*81) + (5*8) + (4*83) + (3*9) = 330 + 405 + 40 + 332 + 27 = 1134\ndiscounted this is 1134 * 0.98 = 1111.32\n\nI will make a counteroffer of [1, 1, 2, 0, 1] since it gives a higher value than my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 2, 0, 1]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    80 x 0 + 88 x 0 + 57 x 0 + 43 x 0 + 18 x 1\n    which is 18 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 35. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 2, 2, 1, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 2, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 2, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 35\n*   My item values: Item 1: 80, Item 2: 88, Item 3: 57, Item 4: 43, Item 5: 18\n*   Total items: Item 1: 6, Item 2: 6, Item 3: 7, Item 4: 4, Item 5: 4\n*   Discount factor: 0.98. This means accepting an offer in a later round is slightly less valuable than accepting it now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am offered [1, 1, 2, 0, 1]. This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 6 - 1 = 5\n    *   Item 2: 6 - 1 = 5\n    *   Item 3: 7 - 2 = 5\n    *   Item 4: 4 - 0 = 4\n    *   Item 5: 4 - 1 = 3\n    My value for this offer: (5 * 80) + (5 * 88) + (5 * 57) + (4 * 43) + (3 * 18) = 400 + 440 + 285 + 172 + 54 = 1351\n\n    Since 1351 > 35, accepting is better than walking away right now.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Let's consider a few options. I want to maximize my value while giving Player 1 enough to keep them engaged. Let's consider giving them slightly more than their previous offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is significantly better than my outside offer. However, it's round 2, and I might be able to improve the deal slightly. Since the previous round's offer was [2, 2, 2, 1, 1], let's consider a counteroffer that gives Player 1 a bit more of Item 1 and Item 2 but less of Item 3. Let's try [2, 2, 1, 0, 1].\n\n*   Counteroffer: [2, 2, 1, 0, 1]\n    *   Item 1: 6 - 2 = 4\n    *   Item 2: 6 - 2 = 4\n    *   Item 3: 7 - 1 = 6\n    *   Item 4: 4 - 0 = 4\n    *   Item 5: 4 - 1 = 3\n    My value for this counteroffer: (4 * 80) + (4 * 88) + (6 * 57) + (4 * 43) + (3 * 18) = 320 + 352 + 342 + 172 + 54 = 1240\n\nThis is also much greater than my outside offer.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 89. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 711 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    57 x 0 + 34 x 0 + 30 x 1 + 58 x 0 + 58 x 1\n    which is 88 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 89. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 1, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 1, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",

This means that any offer accepted in later rounds is slightly less valuable than the same offer accepted now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 2, 1, 0, 1]. This means I would receive:\n    *   Item 1: 1 unit (3 total - 1 given to player 1 - 1 offered to me = 1)\n    *   Item 2: 2 units (7 - 2 - 2 = 3)\n    *   Item 3: 1 unit (4 - 1 - 1= 2)\n    *   Item 4: 0 units (1 - 0 - 0 = 1)\n    *   Item 5: 1 unit (3 - 1 - 1 = 1)\n\n    My value from accepting this offer would be:\n    1 * 57 + 3 * 34 + 2 * 30 + 1 * 58 + 1 * 58 = 57 + 102 + 60 + 58 + 58 = 335\n    Since 335 > 89 (my outside offer), accepting this offer is better than walking away *right now*.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider if I can propose a counteroffer that yields a higher value than 335.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is significantly better than my outside offer. I could try to get more, but I also risk a walkaway in the following round if Player 1 rejects my counteroffer. Since this is round 1 and I have a comfortable margin over my outside offer, I can risk a counteroffer. I will aim for a more even split.\n\nLet's try to propose a counteroffer where I give Player 1 half of the items if possible, otherwise as close as possible.\n\n* Item 1: Offer Player 1 1 unit. I keep 2.\n* Item 2: Offer Player 1 3 units. I keep 4.\n* Item 3: Offer Player 1 2 units. I keep 2.\n* Item 4: Offer Player 1 0 units. I keep 1.\n* Item 5: Offer Player 1 1 units. I keep 2.\n\nValue to me: 2 * 57 + 4 * 34 + 2 * 30 + 1 * 58 + 2 * 58 = 114 + 136 + 60 + 58 + 116 = 484\n\nThis is much better than the current offer and my outside offer.

So, the present value of accepting this offer is 527 * 0.98 = 516.46\n\nMy outside offer is worth 867. Since 516.46 < 867, accepting this offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider a counteroffer. My goal is to maximize my value, knowing there is one round remaining. I need to offer something that is better for player 2 than walking away, but still gives me more than 867 (adjusted for the discount factor).\n\nA reasonable starting point for a counteroffer is the original offer from round 1, i.e., giving Player 2 [1, 2, 1, 0, 1]. Let's assess if there is value in going back to that offer.\nIf I offer Player 2 [1, 2, 1, 0, 1], then I would receive:\nItem 1: 3 - 1 = 2 units\nItem 2: 7 - 2 = 5 units\nItem 3: 4 - 1 = 3 units\nItem 4: 1 - 0 = 1 units\nItem 5: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n\nMy value would be:\nItem 1: 2 * 4 = 8\nItem 2: 5 * 68 = 340\nItem 3: 3 * 58 = 174\nItem 4: 1 * 43 = 43\nItem 5: 2 * 44 = 88\nTotal Value: 8 + 340 + 174 + 43 + 88 = 653\nDiscounted value in round 2: 653 * 0.98 = 639.94\n\nStill, 639.94 < 867. Thus, even if I offer what I originally did, I'm better off walking. Let's analyze an extreme counteroffer in which I offer nearly everything.\n\nConsider offering [2, 6, 3, 1, 2] to player 2. I would get\nItem 1: 1*4 = 4\nItem 2: 1*68 = 68\nItem 3: 1*58 = 58\nItem 4: 0*43 = 0\nItem 5: 1*44 = 44\nTotal value 4 + 68 + 58 + 0 + 44 = 174\nDiscounted value is 174 * 0.98 = 170.52\nThis is significantly worse than walking.\n\nSince all considerations lead to outcomes worse than walking, my best course of action is to WALK.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 4, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    33 x 0 + 4 x 0 + 8 x 0 + 19 x 4 + 46 x 0\n    which is 76 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 77. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 2, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 2, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 77\n*   **Values of the items:** item 1: 33, item 2: 4, item 3: 8, item 4: 19, item 5: 46\n*   **Total pool of items:** item 1: 4, item 2: 1, item 3: 5, item 4: 6, item 5: 3\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.98. This means that accepting an offer in later rounds is slightly less valuable than accepting it now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 0, 2, 2, 1]. This means I would get:\n    *   Item 1: 1 * 33 = 33\n    *   Item 2: 0 * 4 = 0\n    *   Item 3: 2 * 8 = 16\n    *   Item 4: 2 * 19 = 38\n    *   Item 5: 1 * 46 = 46\n    *   Total value: 33 + 0 + 16 + 38 + 46 = 133\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** 133 > 77. Accepting the current offer is better than walking away *right now*.\n\n3) **Potential counteroffers:** Let's consider a few potential counteroffers to see if we can get an even better deal. I will try to make some offers where I get more value than my current offer and also stay close to or above my outside offer. Player 1 currently gets [1, 0, 2, 2, 1]\n\nHere's the current division:\nPlayer 1: [1, 0, 2, 2, 1]\nPlayer 2: [3, 1, 3, 4, 2]\nPlayer 2 Total Value: (3 * 33) + (1 * 4) + (3 * 8) + (4 * 19) + (2 * 46) = 99 + 4 + 24 + 76 + 92 = 295\n\nLet's consider these variations and calculate their values. \n\nConsider, I offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]:\nPlayer 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nPlayer 2: [4, 1, 5, 6, 3]\nPlayer 2 Total Value: (4 * 33) + (1 * 4) + (5 * 8) + (6 * 19) + (3 * 46) = 132 + 4 + 40 + 114 + 138 = 428\n\nConsider, I offer [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]:\nPlayer 1: [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]\nPlayer 2: [3, 1, 4, 5, 2]\nPlayer 2 Total Value: (3 * 33) + (1 * 4) + (4 * 8) + (5 * 19) + (2 * 46) = 99 + 4 + 32 + 95 + 92 = 322\n\nConsider, I offer [1, 0, 2, 2, 0]:\nPlayer 1: [1, 0, 2, 2, 0]\nPlayer 2: [3, 1, 3, 4, 3]\nPlayer 2 Total Value: (3 * 33) + (1 * 4) + (3 * 8) + (4 * 19) + (3 * 46) = 99 + 4 + 24 + 76 + 138 = 341\n\nSince the current offer is better than my outside offer, I am inclined to accept. However, given the discount factor and only being in round 1, I will try one counteroffer to attempt to improve the situation. It would be a bad idea to walk away. I think if I can get more units of item 5 then I would improve my standing. The player has only 1 unit of it.\n\n**Decision:**\nSince the current offer is significantly better than my outside offer, I will make a counteroffer that is still quite generous to player 1 to see if I can secure a slightly better deal. I'll propose giving them [1, 0, 1, 1, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]}\n```",

I need to make an initial offer to Player 2. I want to maximize my expected payoff, taking into account the possibility of Player 2 accepting, rejecting and making a counteroffer, or walking away.\n\nA good starting point is to consider an \"even split\" as a baseline, and then adjust based on my valuations. Also, my outside offer is a significant constraint.\n\nLet's consider offering Player 2 half of each item, rounding down where necessary (since we can't have fractions). This would be:\n- Item 1: 3\n- Item 2: 0\n- Item 3: 2\n- Item 4: 1\n- Item 5: 2\n\nThis would leave me with:\n- Item 1: 4\n- Item 2: 1\n- Item 3: 3\n- Item 4: 2\n- Item 5: 3\n\nMy value from this split would be:\n(4 * 90) + (1 * 78) + (3 * 98) + (2 * 28) + (3 * 20) = 360 + 78 + 294 + 56 + 60 = 848\n\nNow, let's calculate the value of the offer to Player 2, from my perspective:\n(3 * 90) + (0 * 78) + (2 * 98) + (1 * 28) + (2 * 20) = 270 + 0 + 196 + 28 + 40 = 534\n\nSince my outside offer is 721, I want an offer that gives me at least that much. 848 is above 721, so that's good.\nSince it's round 1, I can afford to start with an offer that favors me a bit more. Let's consider an offer that gives player 2 slightly less than the \"even split\" above. I can only offer whole numbers of each item. How about:\n- Item 1: 2\n- Item 2: 0\n- Item 3: 2\n- Item 4: 1\n- Item 5: 2\n\nThis would leave me with:\n- Item 1: 5\n- Item 2: 1\n- Item 3: 3\n- Item 4: 2\n- Item 5: 3\n\nMy value from this split would be:\n(5 * 90) + (1 * 78) + (3 * 98) + (2 * 28) + (3 * 20) = 450 + 78 + 294 + 56 + 60 = 938\n\nNow, let's calculate the value of the offer to Player 2, from my perspective:\n(2 * 90) + (0 * 78) + (2 * 98) + (1 * 28) + (2 * 20) = 180 + 0 + 196 + 28 + 40 = 444\n\nThis gives me a value of 938, which is well above my outside offer. It also offers Player 2 a reasonable value, potentially encouraging acceptance or at least a counteroffer rather than a walk.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 2, 1, 2]}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 3, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    77 x 0 + 65 x 0 + 66 x 0 + 31 x 3 + 10 x 5\n    which is 143 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 144. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 2, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 0, 2, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value: 144\n   - Values of items: item 1 = 77, item 2 = 65, item 3 = 66, item 4 = 31, item 5 = 10\n   - Total pool of items: 7 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.98. This means that accepting an offer later is slightly less valuable than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of the current offer:**\n   - Current offer: [2, 0, 2, 1, 2] (This is what *I* receive)\n   - Value of current offer: (2 * 77) + (0 * 65) + (2 * 66) + (1 * 31) + (2 * 10) = 154 + 0 + 132 + 31 + 20 = 337\n   - Since 337 > 144, accepting the current offer is better than walking away.\n\n3) **Consider a counteroffer:**\n   - I need to consider if I can get an even better deal by making a counteroffer. Let's analyze the current division of items:\n        - Player 2 (Me): [2, 0, 2, 1, 2]\n        - Player 1: [7-2, 1-0, 5-2, 3-1, 5-2] = [5, 1, 3, 2, 3]\n   - Since this is round 1, and accepting the current offer yields a value of 337, let's explore a counteroffer to see if we can improve upon it. Given the time constraint, calculating the optimal strategy using all possible counteroffers is not feasible. Instead, let's try to get more of Item 1, as it has the highest value. I will offer Player 1 the following items:\n\n   - Counteroffer: [4, 1, 4, 3, 5]\n\n   - Items I keep:\n     - Item 1: 7 - 4 = 3\n     - Item 2: 1 - 1 = 0\n     - Item 3: 5 - 4 = 1\n     - Item 4: 3 - 3 = 0\n     - Item 5: 5 - 5 = 0\n   - My value: (3 * 77) + (0 * 65) + (1 * 66) + (0 * 31) + (0 * 10) = 231 + 0 + 66 + 0 + 0 = 297\n   - The counteroffer is worse than the original one, so let's go back to the original offer of [2, 0, 2, 1, 2] with a value of 337.\n   - Since 337 is already much larger than my outside offer of 144, it seems best to accept.\n\n4) **Make a decision:**\n   - The current offer is much better than my outside offer.\n   - Making a counteroffer in round 1 might allow me to gain some more value, but it's also risky because player 1 can walk away. After considering mistake 3 (Offering no items or all items), I will accept the current offer.\n   - Thus, I should accept the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

My goal is to leave player 2 with as little value as possible while ensuring the offer is attractive enough for them to accept. I will start by offering player 2 a split that gives me a value that is just higher than my outside offer *after discounting*.\n\nI want to determine what offer to make to Player 2.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 212. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1098 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 0, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    73 x 1 + 79 x 0 + 76 x 0 + 60 x 1 + 78 x 1\n    which is 211 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 212. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 1, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 3, 1, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

This means that an offer accepted in a later round is worth slightly less.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 3, 1, 2, 1]. This means I would get 1 unit of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5. The value to me is:\n    (1 * 73) + (3 * 79) + (1 * 76) + (2 * 60) + (1 * 78) = 73 + 237 + 76 + 120 + 78 = 584\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** 584 is greater than my outside offer of 212. So accepting this offer is much better than walking away *right now*.\n*   **Consider a counteroffer:** Because round 1 includes a discount rate, there may be more favorable opportunities to negotiate.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\nSince the current offer is much better than my outside option, I should not walk away. I also should not accept *right now* as I have not attempted to negotiate for a more favorable deal and the high total value indicates the other player might accept a deal which offers more value to me.

The current offer gives me [2, 4, 2, 2, 1] units of each item. My private values are [72, 57, 75, 19, 81] for items 1 through 5, respectively. My outside offer is 730. The discount factor is 0.98.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the value of the current offer:\n* Item 1: 2 * 72 = 144\n* Item 2: 4 * 57 = 228\n* Item 3: 2 * 75 = 150\n* Item 4: 2 * 19 = 38\n* Item 5: 1 * 81 = 81\nTotal value of the current offer = 144 + 228 + 150 + 38 + 81 = 641\n\nNow, I need to discount this value by the discount factor since it's round 2.\nDiscounted value = 641 * (0.98)^(2-1) = 641 * 0.98 = 628.18\n\nSince the discounted value of the current offer (628.18) is less than my outside offer (730), accepting the offer is not a good idea.\n\nNow let's consider a counteroffer. In round 1, I offered [1, 3, 1, 2, 1] to player 2. They countered with [2, 4, 2, 2, 1]. This means I would have 4 - 2 = 2 of item 1, 8 - 4 = 4 of item 2, 4 - 2 = 2 of item 3, 5 - 2 = 3 of item 4, 2 - 1 = 1 of item 5. That's the current offer.\n\nIf I want more than my outside option, I need to find a better offer. Because it is round 2, I have limited negotiation power. If I reject the current offer with another counteroffer, it is likely that player 2 will reject in round 3, leaving me with my outside option.\n\nLet's think about what a fair offer would be. The total possible value is 4 * 72 + 8 * 57 + 4 * 75 + 5 * 19 + 2 * 81 = 288 + 456 + 300 + 95 + 162 = 1301. I want more than 730, so I need player 2 to have less than 1301-730=571. \n\nGiven that there is only one round left after this, and my current offer has a value lower than my outside option, I will make a counteroffer that is only slightly more generous to player 2 in order to try and secure a deal, but likely player 2 will reject this offer.\n\nI will offer player 2: [1, 3, 1, 1, 0] units of each item.\nThis would leave me with: 3 of item 1, 5 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 4 of item 4, 2 of item 5.\nValue to me is: 3*72 + 5*57 + 3*75 + 4*19 + 2*81 = 216 + 285 + 225 + 76 + 162 = 964\nDiscounted Value to me: 964 * 0.98 = 944.72\n\nSince 944.72 > 730, I want this deal.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 3, 1, 1, 0]}\n",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    6 x 0 + 61 x 0 + 57 x 1 + 43 x 2 + 30 x 1\n    which is 173 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 174. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [4, 1, 1, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [4, 1, 1, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [7, 2, 3, 3, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    80 x 7 + 59 x 2 + 25 x 3 + 5 x 3 + 76 x 5\n    which is 1148 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1151. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

The impact of the discount factor will become more important in later rounds, but for now, I'll primarily focus on immediate values.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [3, 1, 1, 1, 1]. This means they keep:\n    *   Item 1: 7 - 3 = 4\n    *   Item 2: 3 - 1 = 2\n    *   Item 3: 4 - 1 = 3\n    *   Item 4: 3 - 1 = 2\n    *   Item 5: 5 - 1 = 4\n    My value for accepting this offer would be:\n    (4 * 80) + (2 * 59) + (3 * 25) + (2 * 5) + (4 * 76) = 320 + 118 + 75 + 10 + 304 = 827. This is less than my outside offer of 1151.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer. I will start by seeing what value I get if I keep all of the items.\n    (7 * 80) + (3 * 59) + (4 * 25) + (3 * 5) + (5 * 76) = 560 + 177 + 100 + 15 + 380 = 1232. This is greater than my outside offer. So I need to find an offer that allows me to obtain a value higher than 1151.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Accepting the current offer yields a value of 827, which is less than my outside offer of 1151. So, I shouldn't accept it (Mistake 4).\n*   Walking away yields a value of 1151.\n*   I need to see if I can propose a counteroffer that I would prefer over my outside offer.\n\nLet's try to determine the minimum I need to keep to exceed my outside offer:\nLet the amount I keep be x1, x2, x3, x4, and x5 for the five items. I need to solve\n80x1 + 59x2 + 25x3 + 5x4 + 76x5 >= 1151\n\nMy current value if I keep everything is 1232. To start, let's offer Player 1 one unit of item 1.\nValue = 1232 - 80 = 1152.\nThis is still greater than my outside offer.\n\nTherefore, offering Player 1 one unit of Item 1 is a reasonable start.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [7, 2, 3, 3, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    80 x 7 + 59 x 2 + 25 x 3 + 5 x 3 + 76 x 5\n    which is 1148 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1151. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 3: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 215. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 654 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 0, 2, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    16 x 2 + 26 x 0 + 15 x 0 + 91 x 2 + 70 x 0\n    which is 214 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 215. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 0, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 2, 0, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best course of action.\n\n1.  **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n    *   My outside offer value is 215.\n    *   My values for the items are: item 1 = 16, item 2 = 26, item 3 = 15, item 4 = 91, item 5 = 70.\n    *   The total pool of items is: 4 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5.\n    *   The discount factor is 0.98. This means that an offer accepted in later rounds is worth slightly less than an offer accepted now.\n\n2.  **Assess the value of the current offer:**\n\n    *   The current offer is [2, 2, 0, 2, 0]. This means I receive 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n    *   My value for this offer is: (2 * 16) + (2 * 26) + (0 * 15) + (2 * 91) + (0 * 70) = 32 + 52 + 0 + 182 + 0 = 266.\n    *   Since 266 is greater than my outside offer of 215, accepting this offer is better than walking away *right now*.\n\n3.  **Consider a Counteroffer**\n\n    *   The current split has me getting [2, 2, 0, 2, 0] and Player 1 getting [2, 3, 1, 3, 1].\n    *   What if I counteroffer to receive: [4, 5, 1, 5, 1]. This means I want everything! Which means I offer Player 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The value for me would be: (4 * 16) + (5 * 26) + (1 * 15) + (5 * 91) + (1 * 70) = 64 + 130 + 15 + 455 + 70 = 734.\n    *   Since the current offer is better than my outside option. Before I make a counteroffer, I should try to see if I can get even more. But I do not want to accidentally offer something that is worse than my outside offer.\n\n4.  **Decision:**\n\n    *   The current offer is worth 266, which is more than my outside offer of 215.\n    *   If I accept now, my value is 266.\n    *   If I walk away, my value is 215.\n    *   If I make a counteroffer, there is a chance Player 1 will walk away.\n    *   In round 1, there is still the possibility of another round where I could get a better offer.\n\n    The current offer is good, but I want to see if I can get a better deal.\n\n    So, let's try a counteroffer. I will offer the following to Player 1: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1]\n    This means I keep: [3, 3, 0, 3, 0]\n    Value for me = (3*16) + (3*26) + (0*15) + (3*91) + (0*70) = 48 + 78 + 0 + 273 + 0 = 399\n\n    Since 399 > 215, I should counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 1, 2, 1]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\nThe current offer on the table is [1, 2, 1, 2, 1] which means I receive:\n* Item 1: 1 unit\n* Item 2: 2 units\n* Item 3: 1 unit\n* Item 4: 2 units\n* Item 5: 1 unit\n\nMy values for these items are:\n* Item 1: 54\n* Item 2: 99\n* Item 3: 15\n* Item 4: 53\n* Item 5: 78\n\nSo, the total value of the current offer to me is:\n(1 * 54) + (2 * 99) + (1 * 15) + (2 * 53) + (1 * 78) = 54 + 198 + 15 + 106 + 78 = 451\n\nSince this is round 2, the discount factor is 0.98^(2-1) = 0.98.\nTherefore, the present value of accepting the current offer is 451 * 0.98 = 441.98\n\nMy outside offer is 517. Since 441.98 < 517, accepting the offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. I want to find an offer that Player 2 might accept and that is better than my outside offer, taking the discount factor into account. Player 2 offered me [1, 2, 1, 2, 1] in the previous round, which implies that they value keeping the remainder: [3, 3, 0, 3, 0]. This doesn't tell us their exact values, but it gives us an indication that they might want those items. I have the option of giving them that and still gaining more.\n\nI have 4 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 1 units of item 5 to divide. My total value is 1069.\n\nLet's see if I can improve by counteroffering [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], keeping all the items for myself. This would be worth 1069 to me and after accounting for the discount rate of 0.98, would result in a value of 1069 * 0.98 = 1047.62 which is much greater than my outside offer of 517. However, player 2 would have to accept the offer of [0,0,0,0,0] which is unlikely.\n\nI need to leave player 2 with something. What about offering them what they offered me last round? I give them [1, 2, 1, 2, 1]. This leaves me with [3, 3, 0, 3, 0], which is worth (3 * 54) + (3 * 99) + (0 * 15) + (3 * 53) + (0 * 78) = 162 + 297 + 0 + 159 + 0 = 618.  Discounted it is 618*0.98 = 605.64 which is greater than 517.\nHowever, it is the same value to me as what they just offered, so I would expect that they would not accept this counter offer.\n\nLet's try to give them a slightly better offer and make sure I keep the most valuable items for myself.\n\nHow about I offer them [2, 3, 1, 3, 1]. In this case, I am left with [2, 2, 0, 2, 0], which is worth: (2 * 54) + (2 * 99) + (0 * 15) + (2 * 53) + (0 * 78) = 108 + 198 + 0 + 106 + 0 = 412.  After discount, 412 * 0.98 = 403.76, which is LESS than my outside offer.\n\nSo, the current offer is still better than walking away (441.98 vs 517). I am going to play it safe and walk away since I am unlikely to get a better offer and do not want to risk losing a better payout.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 1, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    77 x 0 + 12 x 1 + 21 x 1 + 82 x 1 + 24 x 0\n    which is 115 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 116. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 1, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 1, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step to determine the optimal action.\n\n1. **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n   - My outside offer value is 116.\n   - My values for the items are: item 1 = 77, item 2 = 12, item 3 = 21, item 4 = 82, item 5 = 24.\n   - The total pool of items is: 1 unit of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor is 0.98. This means that getting a deal in later rounds is slightly less valuable than getting it now.\n\n2. **Assess the value of the current offer:**\n\n   - The current offer is [1, 0, 1, 2, 0] (what Player 1 is offering me).  This means I would receive:\n     - 1 unit of item 1\n     - 0 units of item 2\n     - 1 unit of item 3\n     - 2 units of item 4\n     - 0 units of item 5\n   - My value for this offer is: (1 * 77) + (0 * 12) + (1 * 21) + (2 * 82) + (0 * 24) = 77 + 0 + 21 + 164 + 0 = 262.\n   - Since 262 is greater than my outside offer of 116, accepting the offer would be better than walking away *at this point*.\n\n3. **Consider potential counteroffers:**\n\n   - I want to find a counteroffer that Player 1 might accept and that gives me a higher value than the current offer of 262. I need to also make sure I am not offering anything that would result in me getting less than my outside offer value of 116.\n   - Since I have to give what Player 1 is offering, let's evaluate my options of counteroffering with that info in mind:\n\n4. **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   - Accepting the current offer yields a value of 262, which is significantly higher than my outside offer of 116.\n   - Making a counteroffer may or may not yield a higher result.\n   - However, waiting may yield a lower result because of the discount factor.\n\nTherefore, my optimal action is to accept the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",
