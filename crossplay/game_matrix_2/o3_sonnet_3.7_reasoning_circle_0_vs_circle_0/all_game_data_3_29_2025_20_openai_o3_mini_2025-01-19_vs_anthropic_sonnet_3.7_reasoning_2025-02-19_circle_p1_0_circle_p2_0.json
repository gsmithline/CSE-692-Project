That gives me a raw total of 156+180+33 = 369. Because we are in round\u202f2 the discount factor applies once (\u03b3^(2\u20131) = 0.98), so the present\u2010value of this deal is 369\u00d70.98 \u2248 361.6.

But note that a counteroffer has to strike a delicate balance: while any counteroffer that gives me more (for example, by reducing Player\u202f2\u2019s share) would boost my own undiscounted value considerably, it runs the risk that Player\u202f2 (who privately values items very differently) may find the re\u2010allocation less attractive. Such a risk could lead to further rounds\u2014incurring additional discounting\u2014or even a collapse of negotiations. \n\nBecause the current offer gives me a robust discounted utility of around 362 (far above my outside value) and given the uncertainty in Player\u202f2\u2019s private values, it is safer and strategically sound to accept this current offer rather than risk a counteroffer that might not be accepted and be forced into further rounds with more discounting.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

                    "response": "Step\u2010by\u2010step reasoning:\n\n1. We know our private per\u2010unit values: item1: 56, item2: 16, item3: 43, item4: 24, item5: 87. (Totals if we got every unit would be 764, so our outside offer of 386 is considerably lower than that.)  \n2. Since the deal is reached in round 1 (no discounting), we want to achieve an outcome that gives us well above 386 (our disagreement point) while making the offer acceptable to Player 2. Although we do not know Player 2\u2019s exact values, we assume that since their per\u2013unit values are drawn uniformly from 1 to 101 the average is roughly 51 for each unit.\n3. In a division we control, we want to \u201coffload\u201d those items whose loss to us is \u201ccheap\u201d (i.e. low private value) but which have a high expected value for Player 2. Comparing our values to the approximate average of 51:\n\u2003\u2013 Item2 (16) and Item4 (24) are quite \u201ccheap\u201d for us while likely being worth around 51 to Player 2.\n\u2003\u2013 Item3 (43) is marginal (a small disadvantage relative to 51), so shifting more of item3 to Player 2 is not too painful.\n\u2003\u2013 Items1 (56) and especially item5 (87) are ones where we have an advantage \u2013 we prefer to keep these.\n4. With totals available being item1: 3, item2: 3, item3: 5, item4: 3, and item5: 3 (17 units overall), we choose to give Player 2 a total number of units that, when multiplied by the rough value of 51 per unit, put them comfortably above their likely outside option value. For example, aiming for about 9 units gives an expected value of about 9\u00d751 \u2248 459, which should make the offer attractive.\n5. Thus a natural division is:\n\u2003\u2022 Offer all of item2 (3 units) and all of item4 (3 units) to Player 2.  \n\u2003\u2022 Also offer 3 units out of 5 of item3, since we have a slight disadvantage on item3 (43 versus 51) and 3 extra units help reach the target of 9 total units.  \n\u2003\u2022 Keep all of item1 and item5 (because our margins there are positive) and keep the remaining 2 units of item3.\n6. Under this proposal:\n\u2003\u2013 Player 2 would receive: 0 units of item1, 3 of item2, 3 of item3, 3 of item4, 0 of item5 (a total of 9 units).  \n\u2003\u2013 Our allocation would be: item1: 3 units, item2: 0, item3: 2, item4: 0, item5: 3.\n7. Our utility then is:\n\u2003\u2022 From item1: 3\u00d756 = 168  \n\u2003\u2022 From item3: 2\u00d743 = 86  \n\u2003\u2022 From item5: 3\u00d787 = 261  \n\u2003Total = 168+86+261 = 515, well above our outside offer (386).\n8. Meanwhile, Player 2 is expected to obtain roughly 9\u00d751 = 459 (an attractive value compared to their unknown outside offer).  \n9. This allocation meets the dual goal: It gives us a high discounted payoff and gives Player 2 an expected utility that stands a good chance of acceptance in round 1.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, my action is to propose the following counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 3, 3, 0]}",

I value item 1 (56) and especially item 5 (87) highly. By contrast, items 2 (16) and 4 (24) are low\u2010value. In the previous round Player 2\u2019s offer (to me) [2, 3, 2, 0, 0] implies that if I were to accept that, the division would be:\n\u2003\u2003My bundle: [2, 3, 2, 0, 0] \n\u2003\u2003P2\u2019s bundle (complement): [3\u20132, 3\u20133, 5\u20132, 3\u20130, 3\u20130] = [1, 0, 3, 3, 3].\nThus, player2 \u201cexpected\u201d roughly an allocation of [1, 0, 3, 3, 3].

However, my reservation (\u201cdisagreement\u201d) value is 451, so I must get at least that much in any accepted division.) When I try to \u201cbuy\u201d agreement by giving up some items, I\u2019d want to give Player\u00a02 as many \u201cunits\u201d as possible (since for each unit my cost is the item\u2019s value to me but his \u201cexpected\u201d per\u2010unit worth is roughly 51) in order to reach a bundle his side might prefer to his private outside offer. In planning an offer, one might try to sacrifice\u2014the loss from what I keep\u2014as much value as possible (up to 540\u2013451 = 89 points in my own valuation) so that my opponent gets many units. For example, if I were to \u201csacrifice\u201d items using only the ones I value the least (item\u00a02 is worth 10 each, and item\u00a01 is worth 15 each), then even offering all 6 units of item\u00a02 plus one extra unit from item\u00a01 would cost me 6\u00d710 + 1\u00d715 = 75 points, leaving me 540 \u2013 75 = 465. (This is my best \u201cgenerous\u201d offer that still leaves me above my disagreement outcome.) But 7 units in total \u2013 and even if Player\u00a02\u2019s \u201ctrue\u201d per\u2010unit values average about 51 \u2013 then gives him about 7\u00d751 \u2248 357 expected points. Given that his outside offer is drawn from a range up to his full\u2010pie (which, with his per\u2010unit values, could be much larger, with an expected reservation near 688), it is extremely unlikely that he would find 357 attractive. In other words, my only way to \u201centice\u201d him would be to give him roughly 14 units in expected worth\u2014but to do that I\u2019d have to sacrifice at least 90 points of my own value, leaving me below 451.\n\nThus, due to the mismatch in our fallback options (with my own best \u201cbargain\u201d of a deal being worth at most 465 \u2013 and that only if he were willing to accept a deal that gives him a meager expected value compared to his outside offer) I cannot design an initial offer that would look attractive to Player\u00a02. Any offer I make would be so heavily weighted in his favor that, if he is rational (and his private numbers tend to make his fallback very high), he will simply reject my offer\u2014and I know that if negotiations derail we each end up with our outside offer (451 for me).\n\nTherefore, in risk\u2011averse equilibrium it is best for me not to attempt to \u201cbargain for a slice\u201d but to immediately WALK away and secure my outside offer of 451 rather than risk a drawn\u2010out negotiation where discounting would only lower my eventual value.\n\nMy response is therefore:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

                    "response": "I want to choose an offer that (a) gives me a present\u2010value \u201cearnings\u201d that is above my outside option of 403 and (b) gives my opponent enough \u201cstuff\u201d that they are (hopefully) better off than waiting for their outside offer. (I have to remember that our negotiation is \u201cdiscounted\u201d slowly \u2013 with \u03b3 = 0.98 in round 1 there is no discounting yet \u2013 and that I am initiating the negotiation.) \n\nStep 1. Totals and my valuations \n\u2003\u2022 There are 5 types with quantities: item1: 1, item2: 5, item3: 2, item4: 2, item5: 4.\n\u2003\u2022 My private per\u2010unit values are: 58, 50, 79, 50, 24. (So if I got every item I\u2019d get: 1\u00d758 + 5\u00d750 + 2\u00d779 + 2\u00d750 + 4\u00d724 = 662.) \n\u2003\u2022 My outside option is 403.\n\u2003\u2022 Thus any deal I propose that I ultimately accept must \u201cearn\u201d me at least 403 (and preferably more) if the deal goes through immediately.\n\nStep 2. Which items \u201cdon\u2019t\u201d I want to share\n\u2003Many negotiation analyses recommend \u201cclaiming\u201d the items that you especially value. For me, item1 (58), item3 (79) and item4 (50) per unit are highly attractive. I can \u201ckeep\u201d these entirely to claim a baseline value. In fact, if I take all of item1, item3 and item4 I get:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item1: 1\u00d758 = 58\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item3: 2\u00d779 = 158\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item4: 2\u00d750 = 100\n\u2003Total = 316.\n\u2003Since 316 is below my outside offer, I must also \u201ccollect\u201d some value from the items I share (items 2 and 5) to boost my overall payoff above 403.\n\nStep 3. Splitting the remaining items \n\u2003Items 2 and 5 amount to:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item2: 5 units at 50 each \u2192 250 if I got them all,\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item5: 4 units at 24 each \u2192 96 if I got them all,\n\u2003\u2003Total = 346.\n\u2003I must secure at least an extra 87 points (since 316 + 87 = 403) from these so that my share is above my outside option. I can \u201cclaim\u201d most of these items. However, if my offer gives my opponent too little, they may simply WALK (i.e. take their outside offer). \n\nOne possibility is to \u201csplit\u201d items 2 and 5 so that I get a bit more than my \u201creservation\u201d while still leaving my opponent a nontrivial share on which they might believe they can do better than their unknown outside offer.\n\nStep 4. Balancing for my first offer \nI choose to give myself all of items 1, 3, and 4 (because these are very \u201cprecious\u201d to me). That gives 316. Then I propose a division of item2 and item5 that yields me an additional safe gain (above 403) but also gives my opponent some units. \n\nFor example, if I propose:\n\u2003\u2013 item2: I keep 2 units and offer 3 units to Player 2,\n\u2003\u2013 item5: I keep 2 units and offer 2 units to Player 2.\nThen my allocation is:\n\u2003Item1: 1 unit\u2003\u2003\u2192 value 58 \n\u2003Item2: 2 units\u2003\u2003\u2192 value 2\u00d750 = 100\n\u2003Item3: 2 units\u2003\u2003\u2192 value 2\u00d779 = 158\n\u2003Item4: 2 units\u2003\u2003\u2192 value 2\u00d750 = 100\n\u2003Item5: 2 units\u2003\u2003\u2192 value 2\u00d724 = 48\nTotal = 58 + 100 + 158 + 100 + 48 = 464.\nThat is comfortably above my 403 outside option.\nPlayer 2 therefore would get:\n\u2003Item1: 0, Item2: 3, Item3: 0, Item4: 0, Item5: 2.\nAlthough I don\u2019t know Player 2\u2019s private valuations, by giving them a majority share of item 2 (which counts for 5 units overall) and a half share of item 5 I hope they see enough promise compared to their outside offer. \n\nStep 5. My chosen action \nSince it is round 1 and I must make the first counteroffer (or WALK), I choose to propose the offer corresponding to giving Player 2 ([item1, item2, item3, item4, item5] = [0, 3, 0, 0, 2]). \n\nThus my response is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 0, 0, 2]}",

In a negotiated deal reached in round 2 a discount factor of \u03b3 = 0.98 applies (since the discount is \u03b3^(r\u20131) and here r = 2, so discount = 0.98). Thus if I were to \u201ckeep\u201d an undiscounted bundle totaling V then its present value to me would be 0.98\u00d7V.

(I\u2019m giving away item5 because its value to me is relatively low.)\nThus my final \u201ckeep\u201d would be:\n\u2003Item1: 1, Item2: 2, Item3: 2, Item4: 2, Item5: 0,\ntotaling 416 (undiscounted), whose discounted worth is 0.98\u00d7416 \u2248 407.68 \u2013 just over my outside offer.\nPlayer 2 would then receive the complement:\n\u2003Item1: 0 (since 1\u20131 = 0),\n\u2003Item2: 5\u20132 = 3,\n\u2003Item3: 2\u20132 = 0,\n\u2003Item4: 2\u20132 = 0,\n\u2003Item5: 4\u20130 = 4.\nThis counteroffer (giving Player 2 [0, 3, 0, 0, 4]) is valid (the numbers lie within the available quantities) and should (in expectation) be at least as attractive to Player 2 as his own outside option.\n\nGiven that the current deal on the table gives me far less (253) and my outside option is 403, I choose to propose my counteroffer.\n\nMy answer in the required format is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 0, 0, 4]}",

                    "response": "Step\u2010by\u2010step reasoning:\n1. We begin by noting the total items available: 2 of item\u00a01, 1 of item\u00a02, 4 of item\u00a03, 4 of item\u00a04, and 8 of item\u00a05. My own per\u2011unit values are: 54, 28, 49, 45, 28 respectively. In a \u201cfull\u2010all\u201d deal I would get a total value of 736, but I already have an outside option worth 259.\n2. In round 1 (with no discount yet) I want to get a deal that gives me more than 259. At the same time I must offer Player\u00a02 a division that\u2014when they compare its benefit (using their own unknown but on\u2011average 51 per unit) with their outside offer (expected roughly half of their maximum total, around 485)\u2013is attractive enough for them to accept.\n3. Given that I want to maximize my share, I should retain items I value very highly relative to my own values. For me, item\u00a01 (54 per unit) is very valuable and also limited (only 2 units). Items 3 and 4 (49 and 45) are moderately high. Items 2 and 5 (both 28) are relatively low\u2010value.\n4. Thus an effective strategy is to concede the items I care least about\u2014that is, give up all of item\u00a05 (8 units) and item\u00a02 (1 unit). This would total 9 units conceded. However, 9 units by an average of 51 each yields roughly 9\u00d751 \u2248 459 expected utility for Player\u00a02. Since we expect their outside offer (on average) to be closer to 485, 9 units\u2019 worth might be a borderline offer.\n5. To tip the balance in their favor we need to add one more unit from an item that I value less. Between items 3 (49) and 4 (45) I choose to concede one unit of item\u00a04. This extra unit concession brings the expected total to about 10 units of \u201cvalue\u201d (10\u00d751 = 510), which should be acceptable given opponent\u2019s outside offer.\n6. In the resulting split therefore my counteroffer is to give Player\u00a02:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a01: 0 (keeping all 2 units)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a02: 1 (giving away the sole unit)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a03: 0 (keeping all 4 units)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a04: 1 (giving 1 out of 4 so that I keep 3)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a05: 8 (giving away all units)\n7. My retained items yield: 2\u00d754 (item\u00a01) + 4\u00d749 (item\u00a03) + 3\u00d745 (item\u00a04) = 108+196+135 = 439, which is comfortably above my outside option (259) while offering Player\u00a02 an expected value of roughly 510 (assuming an average of 51 per unit).\n8. This division is a valid offer (each item\u2019s allocation is within its quantity), so my action is to make the following counteroffer.\n\nFinal answer in the required format:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 1, 8]}",

Meanwhile, although I do not know Player 2\u2019s actual per\u2010unit values or his outside offer, by construction his values are drawn uniformly from 1 to 101. That gives a mean of about 51 per unit. With 18 total item units (4+3+3+4+4), his full \u201ctotal\u201d (if he got everything) would be around 18\u00d751 \u2248 918. His outside offer is drawn uniformly from 1 to his total; hence we can roughly expect his outside offer to average near \u00bd of 918, about 459.\n\n3. In our multi\u2010round discounted bargaining (with discount factor \u03b3 = 0.98 per round), if Player 2 rejects my offer he may try to improve his outcome in future rounds. However, as the proposer I can design an offer that appears just as attractive to him as his \u201creservation\u201d (or outside) value, yet leaves me a huge share of my own value.\n\n4. My own strong interests lie in Items 4 and 5 (which I value very highly: 71 and 86 per unit) so I want to keep them. In contrast I value Items 1\u20133 relatively lower (35, 14, and 12 per unit). Hence a natural strategy is to \u201cgive away\u201d those items\u2014even if all of them might not exactly meet the opponent\u2019s reservation utility, I note that the aggregate value for him, if his average per\u2010unit value is roughly 51, will be roughly: \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 For Item 1: each unit ~51 in expected value \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Items 2 and 3: similarly ~51 per unit.\n\u2003\u2003Thus, giving him 9 total units should yield him roughly 9\u00d751 = 459 in expected value, which is about what we anticipate his outside option to be.\n\n5. There are 18 total units. I choose to give him exactly 9 units by offering him all of Items 2 and 3 (which are 3 and 3 units, respectively, totaling 6 units) and 3 units of Item 1 (from 4 available). This puts nearly no share of the high\u2010value Items 4 and 5 into his hands. My resulting allocation would then be:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 1: I get 1 unit (4 \u2212 3)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 2: I get 0 units (3 \u2212 3)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 3: I get 0 units (3 \u2212 3)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Items 4 & 5: I get all 4 units each.\n\u2003\u2003My own utility becomes: 1\u00d735 + 4\u00d771 + 4\u00d786 = 35 + 284 + 344 = 663, which is comfortably above the outside offer of 177.\n\n6. From Player 2\u2019s perspective (using his private values, though unknown to me) the expected value of his share is around 3+3+3 = 9 units \u00d7 ~51 = 459 \u2013 essentially matching his expected reservation value. Thus even if he\u2019s trying to do better by countering in later rounds (and incurring discounting risks or the possibility of a walk\u2010away outcome), he should find a fair possibility in accepting this offer.\n\n7. Consequently, a reasonable initial counteroffer that is valid (allocations do not exceed available quantities) and maximizes my value (by keeping the high\u2010value items for myself) is to offer Player 2 exactly:\n\u2003\u2003[3, 3, 3, 0, 0]\n\nTherefore, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 3, 3, 0, 0]}",

In choosing an initial proposal I want to \u201canchor\u201d the negotiation so that I ultimately get more than my fallback while still offering Player\u00a02 something that might tempt them to agree rather than walk away. (Player 2\u2019s true values are hidden; however, if we assumed roughly \u201caverage\u201d valuations they might expect\u2010in\u2010expectation\u2013about half the total value on their side.) \n\nOne natural idea is to \u201csplit\u201d the bundle in a nearly even way. An even split of the items would give each roughly half the total value (\u2248716), but that\u2019s below my fallback of 774. So I must tilt the split in my favor. On the other hand, if I \u201chog\u201d too many high\u2010value items (for example, those on which I get 77 per unit) then my counteroffer might be too unattractive for Player\u00a02. \n\nAfter some trial adjustments I settled on an offer that gives Player\u00a02 the following quantities of each item:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 1: 2 units out of 4\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 2: 4 out of 8\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 3: 2 out of 4\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 4: 3 out of 8\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 5: 2 out of 5\n\nThat means I would keep the remainder:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 1: 4 \u2013 2 = 2 units\u2003\u2003(Value: 2\u00d777 = 154)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 2: 8 \u2013 4 = 4 units\u2003\u2003(Value: 4\u00d739 = 156)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 3: 4 \u2013 2 = 2 units\u2003\u2003(Value: 2\u00d79 = 18)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 4: 8 \u2013 3 = 5 units\u2003\u2003(Value: 5\u00d749 = 245)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 5: 5 \u2013 2 = 3 units\u2003\u2003(Value: 3\u00d777 = 231)\n\nMy total value in that case is 154 + 156 + 18 + 245 + 231 = 804, which is safely above my outside offer (774).

Therefore, in order for Player 2 to be inclined to agree rather than use their outside offer, my proposal should \u201callocate\u201d them a set of items that would be worth roughly 382 on average to them.\n\nStep 4: In crafting my offer, I have some \u201croom\u201d to be generous with items that are \u201ccheap\u201d for me.

One way to do so is to choose integers x1, \u2026, x5 (units offered to Player 2 of each item\u2014with the constraints that x1 \u2264 4, x2 \u2264 1, x3 \u2264 4, x4 \u2264 3, x5 \u2264 3) satisfying:\n\u2003\u200330\u00b7x1 + 33\u00b7x2 + 59\u00b7x3 + 35\u00b7x4 + 13\u00b7x5 \u2264 234.\n\nI want to \u201cbuy\u201d some extra margin for myself while also giving Player 2 a \u201cbasket\u201d that is attractive in expected terms. For instance, consider giving them all of the \u201clow\u2010cost\u201d items (item4 and item5) and part of item1. One candidate is:\n\u2003\u2003x1 = 2,\u2003x2 = 0,\u2003x3 = 0,\u2003x4 = 3,\u2003x5 = 3.\nLet\u2019s check the \u201ccost\u201d from my perspective:\n\u2003\u2003Cost = 2\u00d730 + 0\u00d733 + 0\u00d759 + 3\u00d735 + 3\u00d713 \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003 = 60 + 0 + 0 + 105 + 39 = 204.\nThen my retained value is 533 \u2013 204 = 329, which is above my outside offer (299).\n\nStep 6: Now, what does Player 2 get? In my offer, they would receive:\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 2 units\u2003\u2003(\u201ccost\u201d for me: 60, but likely worth roughly 2\u00d751 = 102 to them),\n\u2003\u2003Item 2: 0 units,\n\u2003\u2003Item 3: 0 units,\n\u2003\u2003Item 4: all 3 units\u2003 (worth roughly 3\u00d751 = 153),\n\u2003\u2003Item 5: all 3 units\u2003 (worth roughly 3\u00d751 = 153).\nThus, from an \u201caverage\u201d perspective the basket\u2019s expected worth is about 102 + 153 + 153 = 408, which should be competitive compared to their expected outside offer (~382). (Of course Player 2\u2019s true values are private.)\n\nStep 7: The allocation is feasible (none of the numbers exceed the available supply) and respects my own reservation requirement while likely enticing Player 2. Therefore, my first\u2013round action is to make this counteroffer.\n\nThus my response is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 0, 3, 3]}",

(My outside option is 750, so I need any deal I get to be worth more than 750 on my own values.) \n\nAt the same time, Player 2\u2019s unit values are private and drawn uniformly from 1 to 101.

Under that current offer I would get:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item1: 1 unit\u2003\u2003\u2192 1\u00d772 = 72  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item2: 0 units\u2003\u2003\u2192 0\u00d747 = 0  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item3: 1 unit\u2003\u2003\u2192 1\u00d756 = 56  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item4: 3 units\u2003\u2003\u2192 3\u00d763 = 189  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item5: 4 units\u2003\u2003\u2192 4\u00d777 = 308  \n\u2003\u2003Total raw value = 72 + 56 + 189 + 308 = 625.  \n4. Because we are now in round 2 the discount factor is gamma = 0.98 (the payoff is multiplied by 0.98 since r = 2). Thus the present value of this deal is 625 \u00d7 0.98 \u2248 612.5.\n5. My private outside offer is 750 (and if I WALK away I am guaranteed that amount, with no discounting). Since 750 > 612.5, accepting the current offer would give me less than what I can secure by walking away.\n6. In a counteroffer I might try to engineer a split that increases my share. In order to get a present (discounted) utility that exceeds 750 in round 2, my \u201craw\u201d share would need to be at least around 750/0.98 \u2248 765. However, using my valuations the best I can hope for forces me to \u201csqueeze\u201d Player 2\u2019s share to around 548 of my points (since 1313 \u2013 765 = 548). (For example, my previous offer [0,8,3,0,0] would give Player 2 about 544 in my scale and me 769\u2014but that very offer was already rejected by Player 2 in round 1, and any move toward giving them more would force my guaranteed amount below my outside offer.)\n7. Given that Player 2\u2019s own counteroffer (which gives them, from a \u201ccomplement\u2010of-offer\u201d perspective, roughly 688 points in my measure) is far more attractive to them, any counteroffer that would raise their incentive to accept would require me to concede so much that my eventual share (after discount) would fall well below my outside option.\n8. Thus, because my outside option (750) is higher than the discounted value of both the current offer (\u2248612.5) and any plausible counteroffer I might propose, my best strategic move is to WALK away from negotiations.\n\nTherefore, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Thus, to \u201cpay\u201d him as little as possible, I should assign him the items I value less:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Among my items, item 2 (value 7) is much less valuable to me than the others.\n\u2022 The minimum requirement is to \u201cbuy\u201d Player 2\u2019s acceptance with about 9 units in total because expected value would be 9 \u00d7 51 \u2248 459. However, to be on the safe side and reward him a little extra (so that he prefers accepting rather than pulling his outside offer), I choose to \u201cbuy\u201d him about 10 units (\u2248510 expected value).\n\u2022 I must pick 10 units from the available pool in a way that minimizes my loss:\n\u2003\u20031. Use all 5 units of Item 2 (costing 5 \u00d7 7 = 35).\n\u2003\u20032. Next, use the full 3 units of Item 1 (costing 3 \u00d7 59 = 177).\n\u2003\u20033. I now have 5 + 3 = 8 units. I need 2 more.\n\u2003\u20034. Of the remaining items, Item 4 (valued at 68 per unit) is lower \u201ccost\u201d than items 3 or 5 (each 98 per unit), so I take 2 units of Item 4 (costing 2 \u00d7 68 = 136).\n\u2022 Total \u201ccost\u201d for me = 35 + 177 + 136 = 348.\n\u2022 My remaining items (which I keep) would be:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 3: all 3 units (3 \u00d7 98 = 294)\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 The leftover from Item 4: 5 \u2013 2 = 3 units (3 \u00d7 68 = 204)\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 5: all 2 units (2 \u00d7 98 = 196)\n\u2022 My total retained value = 294 + 204 + 196 = 694.\n\u2022 This division gives Player 2 an expected \u201coffer\u201d of 10 units \u00d7 approximately 51 = 510, which should be competitive with his outside option.\n\nStep 4 \u2013 Stating the offer:\n\u2022 In our negotiations the offer is expressed as a vector [n1, n2, n3, n4, n5] representing the number of units of each item that I am offering to Player 2.\n\u2022 I propose giving him:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 3 units\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 5 units\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 0 units\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 2 units\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 0 units\n\nThus, my proposed offer is [3, 5, 0, 2, 0].\n\nFinal action in required format:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 5, 0, 2, 0]}",

That means if no deal is reached I\u2019m guaranteed 683. In order to improve on that I\u2019d need a deal giving me more than 683. Because nearly all of my \u201cpie\u201d is in items I value highly (items\u20051 and 2, with values 78 and 86) while the items I value relatively low (items\u20054 and 5, with values 22 and 44) don\u2019t add enough extra to cover the opponent\u2019s likely reservation value, any concession generous enough to induce Player\u20052 to accept would force me to sacrifice too much of my 768 so that my share would drop below 683. \n\nThus, since my strong outside option leaves me little room for sharing (768\u2005\u2013\u2005683 = 85 points of \u201cvalue\u201d to concede) and because the \u201ccheap\u201d items (items\u20054 and 5) would need to be conceded in quantities that cost me far more than 85, a \u201crational\u201d division from my point of view is extremely self\u2010favoring. In fact, with my fallback so high relative to the total pie, the best I can do is to claim almost everything for myself. \n\nAs Player\u20051 I therefore propose an initial division that gives Player\u20052 nothing \u2013 i.e. offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (meaning you get 0 units of item\u20051, item\u20052, item\u20053, item\u20054, and item\u20055) and I take all available units. This yields me a total value of 768, which is above my fallback of 683. (I realize that from Player\u20052\u2019s perspective this offer gives them 0 \u2013 far below what they\u2019d get if they walked away \u2013 but given my strong outside option you might expect them to reject.

(Recall that we are in round 2 so discounting means any deal\u2019s raw value is multiplied by \u03b3 = 0.98.)\n\n\u2022 In the current round the offer on the table (made last by Player 2) would give me [0, 0, 0, 6, 0]. That means I\u2019d end up with 6 units of item 4. Since my value for item 4 is 22 per unit, that gives a raw value of 6\u00d722 = 132. Discounted to round 2, my payoff would be 132\u00d70.98 \u2248 129.4. This is far below my outside option of 683.\n\n\u2022 To earn as much as (or more than) my fallback, I would need a deal that gives me nearly all of the highly valued items (item 1 is worth 78 per unit, item 2 is 86 and item 5 is 44 per unit) \u2013 and even then I could only afford to \u201cconcede\u201d very little (roughly 70 points in my own scale) to Player 2. In view of the history (Player 2\u2019s own round\u20111 offer had me getting nothing, leaving him with items 1, 2 and 5), any counteroffer that protects my high-value items runs the risk that Player 2 will refuse it in favor of his own fallback. \n\n\u2022 Given that the current offer gives me only about 130 (discounted) versus the guaranteed 683 from walking away, there is no reason to try to engineer a counteroffer that would improve on walking away (and even a counteroffer that pushes toward my \u201cideal\u201d division \u2013 grabbing almost everything \u2013 would probably be rejected by Player 2).\n\nThus, my best response on my turn in round 2 is to WALK away from negotiations.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

                    "response": "I want to begin by outlining my reasoning. I know that:\n\u2022 There are 5 item types with totals of [2, 4, 6, 3, 7].\n\u2022 My per\u2010unit values are [48, 22, 10, 50, 20] so if I got everything I\u2019d have a total value of 534.\n\u2022 My outside option is 35, so in any deal I must ensure that what I get (after discounting) is better than that.\n\u2022 I also know that Player 2\u2019s private values per unit are unknown but drawn uniformly between 1 and about 101. In the absence of more info, I assume that Player 2 may have relatively higher valuations for the items that I personally consider \u201clow\u2010value.\u201d This suggests that I should try to keep for myself the items I value highly (items 1 and 4, with values 48 and 50) and offer most or all of the items I value less (items 2, 3, and 5).\n\u2022 A fair \u201c50/50\u201d from my perspective would be to split the 534 total roughly evenly. One way to get close to that is to give Player 2 almost all of the \u201clow\u2010value\u201d items while I keep everything in the \u201chigh\u2010value\u201d categories.\n\u2022 For instance, if I gave Player 2 all of items 2, 3, and 5, then they would get (using my values): 4\u00d722 + 6\u00d710 + 7\u00d720 = 88 + 60 + 140 = 288 in \u201cvalue\u201d as I see it, and I would get items 1 and 4: 2\u00d748 + 3\u00d750 = 96 + 150 = 246. This split would leave me on the lower side from my perspective.\n\u2022 To improve my outcome a bit, I can \u201cclip\u201d a small part of one of the lower\u2010value items. For example, by keeping one unit of item 5 rather than handing all 7 over, I improve my total from 246 to 246 + 20 = 266, while giving Player 2 only 6 units of item 5. I also adjust item 2 slightly by allowing Player 2 to get 3 of the 4 available, leaving me 1 unit. Under this proposal my allocation becomes:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 For me: item 1: 2, item 2: 1, item 3: 0, item 4: 3, item 5: 1.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 For Player 2: item 1: 0, item 2: 3, item 3: 6, item 4: 0, item 5: 6.\n\u2022 My value for my bundle would then be: 2\u00d748 + 1\u00d722 + 3\u00d750 + 1\u00d720 = 96 + 22 + 150 + 20 = 288.\n\u2022 According to my own numbers, Player 2 would get: 3\u00d722 + 6\u00d710 + 6\u00d720 = 66 + 60 + 120 = 246.\n\u2022 While I\u2019m pushing a bit in my favor, I also want to give Player 2 a package that seems attractive (and is above their outside offer of at least 35) so that they have reason to consider accepting rather than counter\u2010offering.\n\u2022 In a first round no discount has yet applied (discount factor is 1 in round 1), so this is the full-value split as seen from the present.\n \nTaking these things into account, I decide to propose an initial division in which I offer Player 2 the following quantities:\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 0 units,\n\u2003\u2003Item 2: 3 units,\n\u2003\u2003Item 3: 6 units,\n\u2003\u2003Item 4: 0 units,\n\u2003\u2003Item 5: 6 units.\nThis is presented as an offer where the numbers represent the units I give to Player 2.

                    "response": "I\u2019ll explain my thinking. In the current offer on the table my \u201cshare\u201d (if I accept) would be determined by:\n\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 2 total \u2212 0 given = 2 units\u2003\u2192 2\u00d748 = 96  \n\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 4 total \u2212 1 given = 3 units\u2003\u2192 3\u00d722 = 66  \n\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 6 total \u2212 6 given = 0 units\u2003\u2192 0\u00d710 = 0  \n\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 3 total \u2212 1 given = 2 units\u2003\u2192 2\u00d750 = 100  \n\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 7 total \u2212 3 given = 4 units\u2003\u2192 4\u00d720 = 80  \n\nSo if I ACCEPT I get a total raw value of 96+66+0+100+80 = 342. (Then the discount factor for round 2 multiplies this by 0.98 yielding about 335.) (Note: When I first computed using the \u201coffered to you\u201d vector it appeared lower because I was mistakenly reading the offer as what I would directly get\u2014but here the convention is that the counteroffer gives to the other player so that my allocation is the remainder. In the current situation: the offer on table [0,1,6,1,3] is what Player2 proposed to give me, which means that if I accept then my allotment is exactly [0,1,6,1,3]. I then compute my value then as: 0\u00d748+1\u00d722+6\u00d710+1\u00d750+3\u00d720 = 0+22+60+50+60 = 192, and discounted by 0.98 equals roughly 188.16.) \n\nI actually must use the convention that when an offer \u201con the table\u201d is stated as the amount offered to me, then my allocation is that vector. So using that interpretation the current deal \u201cACCEPT\u201d would get me 192 (\u00d70.98 = \u2248188). Given my values (especially my high weights on item 1 and item 4) a deal where I receive nothing of item 1 (or very little) is far from ideal. \n\nMy own Round 1 offer (which I once put forward) would have given me 2 of item 1 and 3 of item 4 (since I offered Player2 [0,3,6,0,6], meaning I would have gotten the complement [2,1,0,3,1] \u2013 worth 2\u00d748+1\u00d722+0+3\u00d750+1\u00d720 = 96+22+0+150+20 = 288). I\u2019m aiming now for something intermediate that greatly improves my outcome versus the current offer while trying to leave Player2 an allocation that might be acceptable (since they would compare it against what they currently would get if I accepted their offer). \n\nSo I propose a counteroffer that \u201creallocates\u201d some units from item 3 (an item I don\u2019t prize highly at 10 per unit) to award me the goods I value most (items 1 and 4). In one candidate proposal I give Player2 the following vector: [0, 1, 4, 1, 3]. In that case my share (the complement) is:\n\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 2 \u2013 0 = 2\u2003\u2003\u2192 2\u00d748 = 96  \n\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 4 \u2013 1 = 3\u2003\u2003\u2192 3\u00d722 = 66  \n\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 6 \u2013 4 = 2\u2003\u2003\u2192 2\u00d710 = 20  \n\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 3 \u2013 1 = 2\u2003\u2003\u2192 2\u00d750 = 100  \n\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 7 \u2013 3 = 4\u2003\u2003\u2192 4\u00d720 = 80  \nFor a total raw value of 96+66+20+100+80 = 362; with the round\u20112 discount factor (\u00d70.98) this is about 354.76\u2014significantly better than the roughly 188 I\u2019d get if I simply accepted. \n\nThe counteroffer [0,1,4,1,3] leaves Player2 a share in items that they might \u201clike\u201d (for example, they\u2019d receive 0 of item 1 as before, but now have 4 of item 3 instead of 6; and 1 of item 4 rather than 1\u2014only one unit difference). Even though from my perspective I\u2019m shifting allocation from a low\u2010value item (for me) to secure more of my prized items, it might still be acceptable enough to Player2 given that waiting another round further reduces the joint surplus. \n\nThus, after weighing my current discounted payoff versus a reallocation that gives me far more value on the items I care about, I choose to propose the counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 4, 1, 3]}",

Thus any accepted deal should yield me more than 708 (when undiscounted in round\u00a01).\n\nBecause I know my own values, I want to keep the \u201chigh\u2010value\u201d items for me. In my case items 2, 3, and 5 are relatively high (73, 96, and 59) while items 1 (38) and 4 (43) are relatively \u201ccheaper\u201d for me. Since I have no direct knowledge of Player\u00a02\u2019s private values (but expect an average of about 51), I assume that giving them more of the items I value less (items 1 and 4) will \u201cbuy\u201d them enough expected value. (For example, giving them all 5 units of item\u00a01 yields an expected value of about 5\u00d751 = 255, and similarly giving them all 6 units of item\u00a04 is about 306; these add to roughly 561. I then add one extra unit from item\u00a05 to bump their expected total above the average disagreement threshold\u2014about 612 extra units in expected value terms.)\n\nSo here is the division I propose:\n\u2003\u2022 Give Player\u00a02: all 5 units of item\u00a01, 0 units of item\u00a02, 0 units of item\u00a03, all 6 units of item\u00a04, and 1 unit of item\u00a05.\n\u2003\u2022 That means Player\u00a02\u2019s offer vector is [5, 0, 0, 6, 1].  \n\u2003\u2022 Then my allocation is the remainder: 0 units of item\u00a01, all 3 units of item\u00a02, all 3 units of item\u00a03, 0 units of item\u00a04, and (5\u20131 =) 4 units of item\u00a05.\n\nLet\u2019s check my own total utility from that:\n\u2003\u2022 Item\u00a02: 3\u00d773 = 219  \n\u2003\u2022 Item\u00a03: 3\u00d796 = 288  \n\u2003\u2022 Item\u00a05: 4\u00d759 = 236  \nTotal = 219 + 288 + 236 = 743, which is above my outside option of 708.\n\nMeanwhile, if Player\u00a02\u2019s expected per\u2011unit value is about 51, then by receiving 5 + 6 + 1 = 12 units (expected value \u224812\u00d751 = 612), they should be getting at least a competitive alternative with their private outside offer (which is drawn from 1 to their full value and in expectation is about half of their possible total).\n\nThus, this initial offer strikes a balance by keeping most of the \u201chigh\u2010value\u201d items for me (items\u00a02, 3, and most of item\u00a05) while giving a bundle that might be just attractive enough to Player\u00a02.\n\nAccordingly, my action in round\u00a01 is to propose this counteroffer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [5, 0, 0, 6, 1]}",

                    "response": "I first check my current situation. My private per\u2010unit values are: item1 = 38, item2 = 73, item3 = 96, item4 = 43, item5 = 59. The totals available are 5, 3, 3, 6, and 5 units respectively, so if I got everything my value would be 1250. (In fact, note 1250 comes from 5\u00b738 + 3\u00b773 + 3\u00b796 + 6\u00b743 + 5\u00b759.) My private outside option is 708 (and note that any deal reached in round r is multiplied by \u03b3^(r\u20131) with \u03b3 = 0.98 so a deal in round 2 is discounted by 0.98). \n\nThe current offer on the table (offered to me by Player 2) is [1, 0, 3, 6, 1]. That means if I ACCEPT I\u2019d receive:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item1: 1 unit\u2003\u2003(1\u00d738 = 38)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item2: 0\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003 (0\u00d773 = 0)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item3: 3\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003 (3\u00d796 = 288)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item4: 6\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003 (6\u00d743 = 258)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item5: 1\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003 (1\u00d759 = 59)\nFor a total of 38+0+288+258+59 = 643.\nDiscounted to this round\u2019s value 643\u00d70.98 \u2248 630, which is below my fallback of 708. So I should not ACCEPT. (WALKING would yield 708 immediately.)\n\nI now have the chance in round 2 to propose a counteroffer. Remember that when I propose an offer it is phrased \u201cwhat I give to Player 2\u201d so that I get the remaining items. The current history shows that earlier I proposed [5, 0, 0, 6, 1] (giving Player 2 those amounts) and Player 2 in turn offered the division [1,0,3,6,1] to me (which is equivalent to giving Player 2 the complement [4, 3, 0, 0, 4]). \n\nI want a deal that is better for me than the current division. In fact, my \u201cshare\u2010value\u201d if I end with a deal is computed as (total available value 1250 minus the \u201cweighted sum\u201d (using my per\u2013unit values) of the items I give to Player 2). With the current offer \u201cto me\u201d I\u2019d be left with 1250 \u2212 (38\u00b74 +73\u00b73 + 96\u00b70 + 43\u00b70 + 59\u00b74) = 1250 \u2212 (152+219+0+0+236) = 1250 \u2212 607 = 643 undiscounted. But to beat my outside option once discounted I need my undiscounted share to be more like at least 1250 \u2212 527 = 723 (since 723\u00d70.98 \u2248 708). \n\nI see that I particularly value items 2 and 3 (and value item5 decently too). In the current division I already get all of item3. So to improve my deal I want to \u201cshave off\u201d some of the items I\u2019m giving to Player 2 in those lines that I value more. (In the current deal Player 2 gets 4 of item1 and 3 of item2, for example.) I can\u2019t take too much from them or they may reject; thus I try to propose a moderately different split that keeps most of what they currently have in the \u201coffer\u201d while giving me a noticeably higher share.\n\nA reasonable modification is to ask for one unit less in item1 and one unit less in item2 than the current division. That is, instead of giving Player 2 [4, 3, 0, 0, 4] (the complement of their offer to me) I propose to give them [3, 2, 0, 0, 4]. Under that counteroffer:\n\u2003\u2022 For item1: I give 3 (and keep 5\u20133 = 2) \u2192 I get 2\u00d738 = 76.\n\u2003\u2022 For item2: I give 2 (keep 3\u20132 = 1) \u2192 value 1\u00d773 = 73.\n\u2003\u2022 For item3: I give 0 (keep all 3) \u2192 value 3\u00d796 = 288.\n\u2003\u2022 For item4: I give 0 (keep all 6) \u2192 value 6\u00d743 = 258.\n\u2003\u2022 For item5: I give 4 (keep 5\u20134 = 1) \u2192 value 1\u00d759 = 59.\nSumming my share gives 76+73+288+258+59 = 754 (undiscounted) and discounting by 0.98 yields about 739 \u2013 a significant improvement over both 630 (the current offer discounted) and my 708 outside option.\n\nEven though this proposal \u201ccuts into\u201d what Player 2 had in their earlier stance ([4,3,0,0,4]), it is only a modest change and is aimed at reaching a deal in round 2 before a third (and more costly) round. This seems a reasonable counteroffer from my perspective.\n\nThus, my action in round 2 is to propose the counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 2, 0, 0, 4]}",

That means if you were to accept that offer, you would receive:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 1: 2 units\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 2: 3 units\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 3: 1 unit\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 4: 1 unit\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 5: 1 unit\nand Player 2 would get the remaining units:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 1: 4 \u2013 2 = 2 units\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 2: 8 \u2013 3 = 5 units\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 3: 2 \u2013 1 = 1 unit\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 4: 3 \u2013 1 = 2 units\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 5: 3 \u2013 1 = 2 units\n\nStep 2: Compute your \u201cdeal\u2010value\u201d from the current offer (without discounting). Your private per\u2010unit values are:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 1: 40\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 2: 11\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 3: 70\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 4: 14\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 5: 21\n\nSo your total (nominal) value if you accept would be:\n\u2003Item 1: 2\u00d740 = 80\n\u2003Item 2: 3\u00d711 = 33\n\u2003Item 3: 1\u00d770 = 70\n\u2003Item 4: 1\u00d714 = 14\n\u2003Item 5: 1\u00d721 = 21\nTotal = 80 + 33 + 70 + 14 + 21 = 218\n\nBecause we are in Round 2 and the discount factor \u03b3 = 0.98 applies such that if resolved this round then your payoff is multiplied by \u03b3^(r\u20131) (with r = 2, so \u03b3\u00b9 = 0.98), your present value would be:\n\u2003218 \u00d7 0.98 \u2248 213.64\n\nStep 3: Compare with your outside offer. Your outside offer is worth 242 (and walking gives that immediately, with no discount). So 213.64 is less than 242. Therefore, accepting the current offer would leave you worse off than disagreeing (WALK).\n\nStep 4: Now, you want to propose a counteroffer that (a) gives you a nominal total value of at least about 242\u20440.98 \u2248 247 (so that after discounting you get at least 242) and (b) does not \u201cover\u2010hurt\u201d Player 2 relative to what they already set up in their offer.\n\nYour current \u201cdivision\u201d (if you accept Player 2\u2019s offer) results in you getting 218 nominal points. You\u2019d like to improve your allocation by \u201ctaking\u201d more of an item that you highly value. Notice that you highly prize Item 3 (70 points per unit) compared to your other items. In the current offer you receive only 1 unit of Item 3, while the total available is 2. Taking that extra unit for yourself would net you an extra 70 points\u2014a large jump in your favor.\n\nHowever, if you simply take that extra unit, Player 2\u2019s allocation (their \u201cshare\u201d) becomes lower by 1 unit of Item 3. In Player 2\u2019s original division from their own offer, they would have received:\n\u2003[Item 1: 2,\u2003Item 2: 5,\u2003Item 3: 1,\u2003Item 4: 2,\u2003Item 5: 2]\n\nTo compensate and help keep Player 2 interested, you can \u201cgive back\u201d a unit from another item that you value relatively little. You value Item 2 at only 11 per unit. Thus, by transferring one extra unit of Item 2 to Player 2, you might make the trade more acceptable to them.\n\nStep 5: Formulate the counteroffer.\nLet your counteroffer be specified as what you offer to Player 2. (Remember: if you propose \u201coffer\u201d: [a, b, c, d, e], then Player 2 gets those amounts and you get the remainder of each item.)\n\nStarting from the current offer [2, 3, 1, 1, 1] (which gives you [2,3,1,1,1] and Player 2 his \u201cremainder\u201d), a trade that \u201cswaps\u201d one unit of Item 3 in your favor for one extra unit of Item 2 for Player 2 works as follows:\n\n\u2022\u2003For Item 3: Instead of giving Player 2 1 unit (as in the current offer), give them 0 units so that you receive all 2 units.\n\u2022\u2003For Item 2: Increase what you give to Player 2 from 3 to 6 units. (Because the total is 8, if you give 6 then you keep 2.)\n\u2022\u2003Other items remain the same if possible.\n\nWhat does this lead to?\nYour counteroffer: Offer to Player 2 the bundle: [2, 6, 0, 2, 2].\n\nThen your allocation becomes the complement:\n\u2003Item 1: 4 \u2013 2 = 2\n\u2003Item 2: 8 \u2013 6 = 2\n\u2003Item 3: 2 \u2013 0 = 2\n\u2003Item 4: 3 \u2013 2 = 1\n\u2003Item 5: 3 \u2013 2 = 1\n\nNow compute your nominal value from the new allocation:\n\u2003Item 1: 2\u00d740 = 80\n\u2003Item 2: 2\u00d711 = 22\n\u2003Item 3: 2\u00d770 = 140\n\u2003Item 4: 1\u00d714 = 14\n\u2003Item 5: 1\u00d721 = 21\nTotal = 80 + 22 + 140 + 14 + 21 = 277\n\nAfter applying the discount (0.98), your present value is:\n\u2003277 \u00d7 0.98 \u2248 271.46\n\u2014which is substantially above your outside option of 242.\n\nPlayer 2\u2019s new share becomes:\n\u2003Item 1: 2\n\u2003Item 2: 6\n\u2003Item 3: 0\n\u2003Item 4: 2\n\u2003Item 5: 2\n\nCompared to their original \u201cself\u2010share\u201d of [2, 5, 1, 2, 2] (from their own offer), they lose one unit of the high\u2010value item (Item 3) but gain an extra unit of the lower\u2010value Item 2. Given that values are drawn from the same range (1 to 101) for Player 2, this trade may be acceptable to them if their realized value for Item 3 isn\u2019t excessively high relative to Item 2.\n\nStep 6: Decision.\nSince accepting the present offer yields you only about 213.64 (discounted) while walking gives you 242, you must counteroffer. The above counteroffer gives you a significantly better deal while still offering Player 2 a bundle that is not dramatically worse than what they initially proposed for themselves.\n\nThus, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 6, 0, 2, 2]}",

                    "response": "Step 1: (Understanding the setting)\n\u2022 We are in round 3 (the final round). As Player 1, if we close an agreement, the deal\u2019s raw value (based on our private item values) is multiplied by a discount factor \u03b3^(r\u20131) = 0.98\u00b2 \u2248 0.9604.\n\u2022 \u201cOutside\u201d (or disagreement) gives us 242 points (and that \u201coutside offer\u201d is not discounted). Thus any deal we close in round 3 must yield a raw value that, when reduced by the discount factor, gives at least 242. That is, we need:\n\u2003\u20030.9604 \u00d7 (raw value) \u2265 242\u2003\u2003\u27f9\u2003\u2003raw value \u2265 242/0.9604 \u2248 252.\n\nStep 2: (What is \u201con the table\u201d now)\n\u2022 The current offer on the table is what Player 2 is offering to us: a bundle of [2, 2, 1, 2, 2] units (of items 1\u20265 respectively). Our private values are: [40, 11, 70, 14, 21].\n\u2022 The value (raw) of accepting that offer is:\n\u2003\u20032\u00d740 + 2\u00d711 + 1\u00d770 + 2\u00d714 + 2\u00d721 = 80 + 22 + 70 + 28 + 42 = 242.\n\u2022 But if we close the deal, we get 242\u00d70.9604 \u2248 232.5, which is less than our outside offer of 242. Thus, accepting is not attractive.\n\nStep 3: (Formulating a counteroffer)\n\u2022 In a counteroffer as Player 1 we \u201coffer\u201d a bundle to Player 2. Player 2 would then receive that bundle and we would \u201ckeep\u201d the remainder. The totals available are: [4, 8, 2, 3, 3].\n\u2003\u2003Our allocation = Total items \u2013 offered-to-P2.\n\u2022 Our own \u201craw\u201d value from our allocation is:\n\u2003\u2003493 \u2013 (40\u00d7x\u2081 + 11\u00d7x\u2082 + 70\u00d7x\u2083 + 14\u00d7x\u2084 + 21\u00d7x\u2085),\n\u2003 where [x\u2081,x\u2082,x\u2083,x\u2084,x\u2085] is the counteroffer we extend to Player 2.\n\u2022 To match our disagreement payoff once discounted, we require:\n\u2003\u2003493 \u2013 (40x\u2081 + 11x\u2082 + 70x\u2083 + 14x\u2084 + 21x\u2085) \u2265 252\u2003\u2003\u27f9\u2003\u200340x\u2081 + 11x\u2082 + 70x\u2083 + 14x\u2084 + 21x\u2085 \u2264 241.\n\u2022 Note that in the current \u201coffer on the table\u201d the deal (seen from our side) would come from giving Player 2 the complement of what is offered to us. In the current offer, that division is:\n\u2003\u2003Player 2\u2019s bundle = [4 \u2013 2, 8 \u2013 2, 2 \u2013 1, 3 \u2013 2, 3 \u2013 2] = [2, 6, 1, 1, 1].\n\u2003\u2003Its \u201ccost\u201d in our valuation is:\n\u2003\u20032\u00d740 + 6\u00d711 + 1\u00d770 + 1\u00d714 + 1\u00d721 = 80 + 66 + 70 + 14 + 21 = 251.\n\u2022 That gives us a raw value of 493 \u2013 251 = 242, which (when discounted) is only about 232.5, too low compared to our outside option.\n\nStep 4: (A small modification that improves our share)\n\u2022 We want to \u201csteal\u201d a little surplus by giving Player 2 just a little less than they receive in the current division\u2014provided Player 2 would still prefer concluding a deal versus walking away.\n\u2022 One simple idea is to reduce their allocation in an item where our own value is \u201ccheap.\u201d In our values, item 2 is worth only 11 per unit. In the current division Player 2 gets 6 units of item 2; if we reduce that to 5 while keeping the other items unchanged, then:\n\u2003\u2003Offer to Player 2 becomes: [2, 5, 1, 1, 1].\n\u2022 The \u201ccost\u201d given to Player 2 in our value:\n\u2003\u20032\u00d740 + 5\u00d711 + 1\u00d770 + 1\u00d714 + 1\u00d721 = 80 + 55 + 70 + 14 + 21 = 240 (which is \u2264241).\n\u2022 Our allocation then is:\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 4 \u2013 2 = 2,\n\u2003\u2003Item 2: 8 \u2013 5 = 3,\n\u2003\u2003Item 3: 2 \u2013 1 = 1,\n\u2003\u2003Item 4: 3 \u2013 1 = 2,\n\u2003\u2003Item 5: 3 \u2013 1 = 2.\n\u2022 Our raw value becomes:\n\u2003\u20032\u00d740 + 3\u00d711 + 1\u00d770 + 2\u00d714 + 2\u00d721 = 80 + 33 + 70 + 28 + 42 = 253.\n\u2022 When discounted: 253 \u00d7 0.9604 \u2248 242.97\u2014which beats our outside offer.\n\u2022 For Player 2, they get slightly less than in the last offer ([2,6,1,1,1] vs. [2,5,1,1,1]). Although we don\u2019t know their private values, this marginal reduction (especially in an item worth relatively little to us) may still be acceptable for them if they prefer to avoid walking away in the final round.\n\nStep 5: (Conclusion)\nOur counteroffer, then, is to offer Player 2 the bundle [2, 5, 1, 1, 1]. This is a valid division and gives us an allocation worth (raw) 253 and, after discount, approximately 242.97\u2014above our disagreement value of 242.\n\nTherefore, our action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 5, 1, 1, 1]}",

                    "response": "I will propose an offer that \u201csaves\u201d the high\u2010value items for me while giving Player\u00a02 a bundle whose expected overall value (if their values are roughly in the middle of the range) is roughly in line with what they might get from their outside option (and/or from waiting for later rounds and incurring time discounting).\n\nLet me explain briefly my thinking. I know my values are: item1=37, item2=41, item3=64, item4=52, item5=95. In my view item1 is \u201ccheaper\u201d (37 per unit) and item2 is also relatively lower\u2010valued while item3, item4, and especially item5 are the items I most want to keep. (Of course Player\u00a02\u2019s private values are uncertain, but the expected value for a uniformly drawn number from 1 to 101 is about 51 for each item\u2014so roughly speaking they \u201cvalue\u201d an item unit around 51 on average.) Also, my outside offer is only 136 while Player\u00a02\u2019s unknown outside offer is based on their own total value (likely much higher on average than mine). Hence, I need to give Player\u00a02 a split that, in expected terms, comes close to what they might receive by \u201cholding out\u201d (especially since any later deal will be discounted by gamma = 0.98 per round). \n\nA natural idea is to concede the \u201ccheaper\u201d items. If I give Player\u00a02 all of items 1 and 2 then they get 5+3 = 8 units, which would have an expected \u201cworth\u201d (to them) of about 8\u00d751 \u2243 408. That may be too low relative to what they might expect from their own offer (which, given the range, could be roughly around mid\u2010400s). To bring their side a bit closer to the \u201cfair\u201d mark, I can add about one extra unit from one of the remaining types. I prefer to sacrifice one unit of item\u00a04 (value 52 to me; it is a lower loss than giving up a unit of item\u00a03 [64] or item\u00a05 [95]). This way Player\u00a02\u2019s offered bundle is: all 5 units of item\u00a01, all 3 units of item\u00a02, and 1 unit of item\u00a04. (Player\u00a02\u2019s \u201cbundle\u201d would then be 5 + 3 + 1 = 9 units; if we think of an average of 51 per unit, that gives roughly 459 in expected value\u2014around what might be needed to induce acceptance early rather than waiting on a discounted later deal.)\n\nMy own resulting allocation would be: I keep 0 of item\u00a01, 0 of item\u00a02, all 5 units of item\u00a03, 2 units of item\u00a04 (since total is 3, and 1 went to them), and all 2 units of item\u00a05. My own value from that is:\n\u2003\u2022 item3: 5\u00d764 = 320\n\u2003\u2022 item4: 2\u00d752 = 104\n\u2003\u2022 item5: 2\u00d795 = 190\nSumming gives 320 + 104 + 190 = 614, which is much better than my outside offer of 136.\n\nBalancing my good outcome with giving Player\u00a02 a chance to beat their outside option, I opt for the following initial offer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [5, 3, 0, 1, 0]}",

Understanding the setting:\n\u2022 There are 5 types of items with quantities [2, 1, 2, 10, 3].\n\u2022 My private per\u2010unit values are:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item1: 48\u2003\u2003(2 units \u2192 96 total)\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item2: 79\u2003\u2003(1 unit \u2192 79 total)\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item3: 91\u2003\u2003(2 units \u2192 182 total)\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item4: 50\u2003\u2003(10 units \u2192 500 total)\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item5: 60\u2003\u2003(3 units \u2192 180 total)\n\u2003\u2003Total = 1037.\n\u2022 My outside option is 355 (which is lower than a \u201cfair\u2010sharing\u201d of our total values).\n\u2022 The discount factor is \u03b3 = 0.98; since we are in round 1, any agreed outcome is full value (multiplier is 1).\n\nStep 2. Strategy considerations:\n\u2022 I want to propose an initial division (a counteroffer) that:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Leaves me with more than my reservation value and a good portion of high\u2010advantage items.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Gives Player 2 enough value so that, from their (uncertain) private valuations (which average around 51 per unit), the offer is at least as attractive as waiting or using their outside option.\n\u2022 Although I do not know Player 2\u2019s exact preferences, note that\u2014on average\u2014their total value is around 918, so their outside offer is drawn from 1 to 918 (average \u2248 460). To help induce acceptance in early rounds, my offer should yield them roughly 500 (in expected \u201caverage\u2010unit\u201d terms) while giving me a slight edge.\n\nStep 3. Identifying which items are \u201cfavorable\u201d for me:\n\u2022 Comparing our unit values to an expected average of about 51:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item3: I get 91 versus an expected 51\u2014a 40\u2010point advantage per unit.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item2: I get 79 versus 51\u2014an advantage of 28.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item5: I get 60 versus 51\u2014a modest advantage.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Items1 and 4: My values (48 and 50) are very near or slightly below 51.\n\u2022 Therefore, I would like to keep all of my \u201cadvantage\u201d items (items 2, 3, and possibly 5) while offering most or all of items where I lose an edge (items1 and 4). However, I must give Player 2 enough \u201cstuff\u201d so they expect a value near or above their outside offer.\n\nStep 4. Crafting an offer:\nOne idea is to give Player 2 everything in the two types where I have little advantage and part of the remainder so that the expected total (using an approximate average of 51 per unit) is near 510.\nA candidate offer is as follows:\n\u2003\u2003Offer Player 2:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item1: 2 units (all units)\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item2: 0 units (I keep my advantage)\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item3: 0 units (I keep my strong advantage)\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item4: 7 units (leave me 3 units out of 10)\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item5: 1 unit (so I keep 2 out of 3)\nLet\u2019s see what that gives:\n\u2003\u2003My share will be:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item1: 0 (0\u00d748 = 0)\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item2: 1 (1\u00d779 = 79)\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item3: 2 (2\u00d791 = 182)\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item4: 10\u20137 = 3 (3\u00d750 = 150)\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item5: 3\u20131 = 2 (2\u00d760 = 120)\n\u2003\u2003Total value for me = 79 + 182 + 150 + 120 = 531, which is well above my 355 outside option.\n\u2003\u2003For Player 2, if we approximate using the average per-unit value (\u224851), their \u201cexpected\u201d value would be:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item1: 2\u00d751 = 102\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item4: 7\u00d751 = 357\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item5: 1\u00d751 = 51\n\u2003\u2003Sum = 102 + 357 + 51 = 510.\nThis nearly even split in expected value (531 vs. 510) gives me a slight advantage as first mover while providing Player 2 with an attractive enough package (above what many outside offers could be).\n\nStep 5. Final action:\nBecause I\u2019m required to provide my counteroffer as a list (which corresponds to the amounts I offer to Player 2 for items 1 through 5), I now state my chosen offer.\n\nThus, my action is to propose a counteroffer giving Player 2 the following amounts:\n\u2003\u2003Item1: 2, Item2: 0, Item3: 0, Item4: 7, Item5: 1.\n\nI now provide that in the required JSON format.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 0, 7, 1]}",

In addition, I want to offer a small piece of one of the moderately valuable items (item\u00a02) or a minimal quantity of item\u00a04 (which I highly value) if needed \u2013 but my goal is to give as little as possible while still \u201cbuying\u201d Player\u00a02\u2019s agreement.\n6. After considering the trade\u2010offs:\n\u2003 \u2022 One prospective offer is to give Player\u00a02 all of the low\u2010value items (all 4 of item\u00a03 and both units of item\u00a05) plus a small concession from one of the items where Player\u00a02 is likely to \u201cexpect\u201d some gain. Giving one unit of item\u00a02 (of which I have 2, valued at 39 for me) serves that purpose.\n\u2003 \u2022 I then also offer a small concession from item\u00a04 (giving 1 unit out of 4) even though item\u00a04 is very valuable to me. This extra unit might help meet Player\u00a02\u2019s \u201creservation\u201d threshold in view of their likely outside offer.\n7. Under this proposed offer:\n\u2003 \u2013 Items offered to Player\u00a02:  \n\u2003\u2003 \u2022 Item\u00a01: 0 (I keep all 3 units)  \n\u2003\u2003 \u2022 Item\u00a02: 1 (leaving me 1 unit)  \n\u2003\u2003 \u2022 Item\u00a03: 4 (I give all 4, which I value very little)  \n\u2003\u2003 \u2022 Item\u00a04: 1 (I keep 3 of the 4 units)  \n\u2003\u2003 \u2022 Item\u00a05: 2 (I give both, again items that are of low value to me)\n8. My resulting bundle is therefore:\n\u2003 \u2013 For me:  \n\u2003\u2003 \u2022 Item\u00a01: 3 units \u2192 3\u00d725 = 75  \n\u2003\u2003 \u2022 Item\u00a02: 1 unit \u2192 1\u00d739 = 39  \n\u2003\u2003 \u2022 Item\u00a04: 3 units \u2192 3\u00d776 = 228  \n\u2003\u2003 Total value = 75 + 39 + 228 = 342 (well above my outside value of 229)\n\u2003 \u2013 For Player\u00a02 (using an average \u201cexpected\u201d per\u2010unit value of about 51):  \n\u2003\u2003 \u2022 Item\u00a02: 1 unit \u2192 ~51  \n\u2003\u2003 \u2022 Item\u00a03: 4 units \u2192 ~204  \n\u2003\u2003 \u2022 Item\u00a04: 1 unit \u2192 ~51  \n\u2003\u2003 \u2022 Item\u00a05: 2 units \u2192 ~102  \n\u2003\u2003 Total \u201cexpected\u201d value \u2248 51 + 204 + 51 + 102 = 408  \nThis division leaves a total \u201csurplus\u201d (342 + 408 \u2248 750) that is roughly in line with our combined potential (noting that Player\u00a02\u2019s maximum total is unknown but their expected outside offer is roughly half their full value). This \u201cjust\u2010enough\u201d offer should be acceptable to Player\u00a02 given the alternative of waiting and discounting.\n9. Given that it is Round\u00a01 (no discount yet) and that I want to start with a slightly aggressive offer that leaves me with most of the items I value highly, I now select this division as my initial offer.\n\nTherefore, my action is to propose the following division (note: the offer list specifies the number of units offered to Player\u00a02 for items 1 through 5):\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 4, 1, 2]}",

With the round\u20102 discount (gamma = 0.98) the present value is 139\u00d70.98 \u2248 136.2. This is much lower than our outside \u201cdisagreement\u201d payoff of 229. In other words, accepting now \u201clocks in\u201d too low a value.\n\nStep 2: We must counteroffer. Remember that when making an offer our counteroffer specifies what we give to Player 2, with our own share being the complement (using the totals [3, 2, 4, 4, 2]). Our own total possible nominal value (using our private item\u2013values) is 481. So if we were to \u201csplit\u201d evenly we\u2019d get roughly 240\u2013240. However, 240 is only slightly above our disagreement value once discounted. We want a deal that both beats our 229 and \u201csells\u201d it (from Player 2\u2019s perspective) without giving away too much.\n\nStep 3: Our item values vary considerably. We get a lot of value from item 4 (76 per unit) and moderately from items 1 (25) and 2 (39). We care very little about items 3 (5 per unit) and 5 (2 per unit). In order to increase our share\u2019s total we want to keep nearly all of items we highly value (especially item 4) while \u201coffering\u201d those items that we care little about. But note that Player 2\u2019s private values are drawn uniformly from 1 to 101 so their \u201caverage\u201d per\u2010unit value is about 51. In expectation, giving them all of an item we \u201cdon\u2019t care about\u201d might still be very attractive for them.\n\nStep 4: A promising idea is to give Player 2 nearly all of items 3 and 5 (where our loss is minimal) and then add a small amount of one \u201cless\u2010valuable\u201d item (for us) so that \u2013 when multiplied by the average expected value of 51 \u2013 the offer to them is roughly what they might hope to exceed compared to their disagreement. Specifically:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 3: total 4 units. We offer all 4. (For us this \u201ccosts\u201d 4\u00d75 = 20.)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 5: total 2 units. We offer all 2. (Cost 2\u00d72 = 4.)\nThus far we have \u201cgiven\u201d 6 units. But in expectation this \u201cbundle\u201d is worth about 6\u00d751 = 306 to Player 2 \u2013 which might be too low relative to what they expect (their expected disagreement is roughly half their total, and for a total of about 765 that means around 382). So we add one more unit from one of the remaining items. Between item 1 (value 25 for us) and item 2 (value 39 for us) the \u201ccost\u201d to our own valuation is lower for item 1. However, one unit of item 1 adds roughly 51 expected points for Player 2. In order to strengthen their incentive to accept we decide to be slightly \u201cgenerous\u201d and give them 2 units of item 1 (instead of 1). This extra unit increases their expected stand\u2010alone \u201coffer\u201d by roughly another 51 so that in total they receive about 8 units\u2019 worth in expectation (8\u00d751 \u2248 408).\n\nStep 5: Let\u2019s see what this counteroffer means:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Our counteroffer (what we give to Player 2) is then:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003Item 1: 2 units  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Item 2: 0 units  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Item 3: 4 units  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Item 4: 0 units  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Item 5: 2 units  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 These quantities are valid (don\u2019t exceed the totals) and give us the complementary allocation:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003Item 1: 3\u20132 = 1 unit  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Item 2: 2\u20130 = 2 units  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Item 3: 4\u20134 = 0 units  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Item 4: 4\u20130 = 4 units  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Item 5: 2\u20132 = 0 units  \nFor our share, our nominal value is:\n\u2003\u20031\u00d725 + 2\u00d739 + 0\u00d75 + 4\u00d776 + 0\u00d72 = 25 + 78 + 0 + 304 + 0 = 407.\nDiscounted by 0.98 (since we are in Round 2) this becomes 407\u00d70.98 \u2248 398.9, comfortably above our outside offer of 229.\nFrom Player 2\u2019s \u201caverage\u201d viewpoint, they receive a bundle of:\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 2 units (expected 2\u00d751 = 102)  \n\u2003\u2003Item 3: 4 units (\u2248204)  \n\u2003\u2003Item 5: 2 units (\u2248102)  \nfor a total expected value of roughly 408 \u2013 a competitive deal relative to typical disagreement payoffs.\n\nStep 6: Therefore, in view of obtaining a negotiated deal that beats our disagreement payoff while \u201cpaying\u201d Player 2 just enough on average, our action in Round 2 will be to make the following counteroffer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 4, 0, 2]}",

                    "response": "Step 1: Analyze the current offer. The current offer (from Player 2) gives you [0, 2, 4, 0, 2]. That means you\u2019d receive:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 1: 0 units\u2003(0\u00d725 = 0)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 2: 2 units\u2003(2\u00d739 = 78)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 3: 4 units\u2003(4\u00d75 = 20)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 4: 0 units\u2003(0\u00d776 = 0)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 5: 2 units\u2003(2\u00d72 = 4)\nFor a total undiscounted value of 78 + 20 + 4 = 102. In round 3 the discount factor is \u03b3^(2) \u2248 0.9604, so agreement value (if accepted) becomes about 102\u00d70.96 \u2248 98. This is far below your outside offer of 229 (received if you WALK). Therefore, accepting the current offer is unattractive.\n\nStep 2: Consider Walking. You\u2019d get 229 for sure. This is your reservation. But if you can get a negotiated deal that gives you a present\u2010value above 229 you improve your outcome.\n\nStep 3: Designing a counteroffer. In round 3 you have only one chance. Your negotiated payoff (if a deal is reached) is discounted (multiplied by 0.9604) so to beat 229 you must get an undiscounted payoff of roughly 229/0.9604 \u2248 238.5. With your item values:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 1: 25 per unit  \n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 2: 39 per unit  \n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 3: 5 per unit  \n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 4: 76 per unit  \n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 5: 2 per unit  \nyou want to secure many of the high\u2010value items (especially item 4, worth 76) while conceding those items that you value less (items 3 and 5). Note that previous offers left you with none of item 4, which is poor for you. However, Player 2 has shown that they like item 4 (in their own offers they kept most of item 4). Hence, to entice them to accept your counteroffer, you must leave them a \u201cslice\u201d of item 4 even though you\u2019d ideally like to keep all of it.\n\nA reasonable balancing act is as follows. Allocate the items so that your undiscounted payoff is above 238 and Player 2 expects to do better than what they\u2019d get by walking (they have a private outside offer, but presumably their expected value is lower than a fair share of the items). One promising division is: \n\u2003\u2022\u2003Give Player 2: 2 units of item 1, 0 of item 2, all 4 of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 2 of item 5.\nUnder this counteroffer your own share becomes the remainder:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 1: 3 \u2013 2 = 1 unit  \n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 2: 2 \u2013 0 = 2 units  \n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 3: 4 \u2013 4 = 0 units  \n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 4: 4 \u2013 2 = 2 units  \n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 5: 2 \u2013 2 = 0 units\n\nStep 4: Verify your payoff.\nYour payoff would be: \n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 1: 1\u00d725 = 25  \n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 2: 2\u00d739 = 78  \n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 4: 2\u00d776 = 152  \nAdding up to 25 + 78 + 152 = 255 (undiscounted). After the discount at round 3, that is 255\u00d70.9604 \u2248 245 \u2013 which beats your outside offer of 229.\n\nStep 5: Check totals.\nTotal available items are:\n\u2003Item 1: 3, Item 2: 2, Item 3: 4, Item 4: 4, Item 5: 2.\nYour offer gives Player 2: [2, 0, 4, 2, 2] and you get the remainder [1, 2, 0, 2, 0]. All sums check out.\n\nThus, to improve upon both the current (inferior) offer and your walking reservation, and to leave Player 2 enough on the table (especially conceding some high\u2010value item 4) so that they are likely to accept rather than walk away, your counteroffer is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 4, 2, 2]}",

(My fallback is 301, so I must \u201cbeat\u201d that.) One standard bargaining tactic is to \u201cclaim\u201d the items I value highly (so as to boost my own utility) while giving Player\u00a02 the items I value less (since I don\u2019t lose much if they end up with them\u2014even though their own private values are unknown, they call \u201chigh values\u201d on some items with probability). In my case the items I \u201creally care\u201d about are item\u00a01 (worth 41/unit) and item\u00a05 (worth 32/unit). (Even though Player\u00a02\u2019s private values might sometimes be high, I can try to keep them off my share if possible.) Items 2, 3, and 4 give me relatively little per unit (8, 2, and 10 respectively) so I can offer these in full to Player\u00a02. (Giving all of an item to the other side is risk sharing: even if Player\u00a02\u2019s private value for that item is lower than average, my cost is low.) \n\nIf I offer Player\u00a02 the entire quantity of each of items 2, 3, and 4 then:\n\u2003\u2022 They get all of item\u00a02: 5 units\n\u2003\u2022 All of item\u00a03: 3 units\n\u2003\u2022 All of item\u00a04: 5 units\n\nThat leaves me with:\n\u2003\u2022 Item\u00a01: all 6 units\n\u2003\u2022 Item\u00a05: all 3 units\n\nMy resulting \u201cpackage\u201d is then worth:\n\u2003Item\u00a01: 6\u00d741 = 246\n\u2003Item\u00a05: 3\u00d732 = 96\n\u2003Total = 342\u2003which is above my fallback of 301.\n\nMeanwhile, Player\u00a02\u2019s offer is the full quantities of items 2, 3, and 4. Although I do not know Player\u00a02\u2019s private values, on average their per\u2010unit value (drawn uniformly from 1 to 101) would be around 51. So in expectation they would see\n\u2003Item\u00a02: 5\u00d7\u224851 = 255\u2003+\u2003Item\u00a03: 3\u00d7\u224851 = 153\u2003+\u2003Item\u00a04: 5\u00d7\u224851 = 255\u2003\u2248 663,\nwhich in many cases would be above their own outside offer. (Of course, if they happen to have unusually low values for these items they might try to negotiate for some of item\u00a01 and/or 5, but this is my opening and I want to \u201cclaim\u201d what I highly value.)\n\nThus, as my opening move (in round 1) I propose to give Player\u00a02 the full allotments of items 2, 3, and 4 and leave items 1 and 5 for myself. In the required format I represent my initial offer as the list [n1, n2, n3, n4, n5] meaning the units given to Player\u00a02 for items 1 through 5 respectively. That is:\n\n\u2003Item 1: 0 units,\n\u2003Item 2: 5 units,\n\u2003Item 3: 3 units,\n\u2003Item 4: 5 units,\n\u2003Item 5: 0 units.\n\nThis offer is valid (each number does not exceed the available units) and gives me a utility of 342 while giving Player\u00a02 a \u201cpackage\u201d that on average is attractive.\n\nTherefore, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 5, 3, 5, 0]}",

                    "response": "Let\u2019s explain our reasoning briefly. We see that the current offer on the table gives us [2,4,1,1,3] so that our share is:\n\u2003\u2022 item1: 2 units\u2003\u2003(value = 2\u00b741 = 82)\n\u2003\u2022 item2: 4 units\u2003\u2003(value = 4\u00b78 = 32)\n\u2003\u2022 item3: 1 unit\u2003\u2003\u2003(value = 1\u00b72 = 2)\n\u2003\u2022 item4: 1 unit\u2003\u2003\u2003(value = 1\u00b710 = 10)\n\u2003\u2022 item5: 3 units\u2003\u2003(value = 3\u00b732 = 96)\nTotaling 222 (which when discounted at \u03b3 = 0.98 in round 2 is about 217.6). That is much lower than our private outside offer of 301 (which we\u2019d get by walking away). \n\nSo\u2014if we waited\u2014the walk\u2010away guarantee would be 301. To make any negotiated deal acceptable we must get an offer whose undiscounted value is at least roughly 301/0.98 \u2248 307. This means we must \u201cdemand\u201d items of high value (for us, item1 at 41 and item5 at 32 are very valuable) and only concede on those items that are of little use to us (for instance, item3, worth only 2 per unit). \n\nWe then consider that any counteroffer we make must also give Player\u00a02 enough so that they prefer immediate agreement rather than risk walking away with their (unknown) private outside offer. Although we don\u2019t know their exact numbers, the previous history shows that in the current offer Player\u00a02 was \u201cgiving\u201d us a share that left them with: \n\u2003item1: 4 units, item2: 1, item3: 2, item4: 4, item5: 0.\nIn crafting our new proposal we choose to be demanding enough to improve on our 222 value (after discount) but \u201cfair\u201d enough to induce acceptance.\n\nOne reasonable counteroffer is to propose that we (Player\u00a01) receive:\n\u2003\u2022 item1: 6 \u2013 2 = 4 units,\n\u2003\u2022 item2: 5 \u2013 2 = 3 units,\n\u2003\u2022 item3: 3 \u2013 3 = 0 units,\n\u2003\u2022 item4: 5 \u2013 2 = 3 units,\n\u2003\u2022 item5: 3 \u2013 0 = 3 units.\nThat gives us a total undiscounted value of:\n\u20034\u00b741 + 3\u00b78 + 0\u00b72 + 3\u00b710 + 3\u00b732 = 164 + 24 + 0 + 30 + 96 = 314,\nwhich, discounted at 0.98, is approximately 307.7\u2014just above our 301 reserve.\n\nAccordingly, we are \u201cgiving\u201d Player\u00a02 the amounts [2, 2, 3, 2, 0] (in the required format, this represents what we hand over to them, and we receive the remainder).\n\nThus, our action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 3, 2, 0]}",

Discount factor: The discounting is by gamma^(r-1). In round 3, that is gamma^(2) = 0.98\u00d70.98 \u2248 0.9604.  \nThus, the present value if you accept would be: 302\u00d70.9604 \u2248 290.\n\n4. Outside offer: Your outside offer guarantees you 301. Since 290 < 301, accepting the current offer is worse than getting your outside offer.\n\n5. In a last-round counteroffer you have one final chance to get a deal that beats your outside offer. Your goal is to get a deal whose raw (undiscounted) value is high enough so that, when multiplied by 0.9604, its present value exceeds 301. (For example, a raw value of about 314 would yield about 314\u00d70.9604 \u2248 302; you likely want even a little extra cushion.)\n\n6. We need to form a new proposal. Recall that in any counteroffer your \u201coffer\u201d numbers denote what Player 2 will get; your share will be what remains based on total available items:\n\u2003\u2003Total available per item:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 6  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 5  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 3  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 5  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 3  \nIf you offer Player 2 the vector [x1, x2, x3, x4, x5], your share becomes:\n\u2003\u2003[6\u2013x1, 5\u2013x2, 3\u2013x3, 5\u2013x4, 3\u2013x5].\n\n7. In the previous rounds the deals exchanged roughly gave you [4,4,0,1,3] and left Player 2 with [2,1,3,4,0]. Aiming for improvement, you want a division that increases your share of the high\u2010value items. You highly value item 1 (41 per unit) and item 5 (32 per unit). An allocation in which you get more of these items might boost your raw value.\n\n8. One acceptable counteroffer is to propose giving Player 2:\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 2 units  \n\u2003\u2003Item 2: 1 unit  \n\u2003\u2003Item 3: 3 units  \n\u2003\u2003Item 4: 2 units  \n\u2003\u2003Item 5: 0 units  \nThen your share becomes:\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 6 \u2013 2 = 4  \n\u2003\u2003Item 2: 5 \u2013 1 = 4  \n\u2003\u2003Item 3: 3 \u2013 3 = 0  \n\u2003\u2003Item 4: 5 \u2013 2 = 3  \n\u2003\u2003Item 5: 3 \u2013 0 = 3\n\n9. Now, calculate your raw value with this deal:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 4\u00d741 = 164  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 4\u00d78 = 32  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 0\u00d72 = 0  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 3\u00d710 = 30  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 3\u00d732 = 96  \n\u2003\u2003Raw total = 164 + 32 + 0 + 30 + 96 = 322  \nDiscounted value = 322 \u00d7 0.9604 \u2248 309, which exceeds your outside offer of 301.\n\n10. This counteroffer improves your outcome relative to both the existing offer and your outside option while remaining \u201cclose\u201d to previous deals so that it might be acceptable to Player 2.\n\nThus, my action is to make the following counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 3, 2, 0]}",
