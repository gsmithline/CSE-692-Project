                    "response": "Here\u2019s my reasoning:\n\n1. First I note that I have high value items (for me) that I want to \u201ckeep\u201d and items where my value is low that I\u2019m willing to give away. In my case item 1 is very valuable to me (89 per unit) so I prefer to keep it all, while items 3 and 4 are very low value to me (11 and 6 respectively) while the opponent\u2014whose private values are drawn uniformly from 1 to 101\u2014should (in expectation) value any item at roughly 51 per unit. Thus it makes sense to concede item 3 (all 3 units) and item 4 (all 4 units) to make the deal attractive.\n\n2. For item 2 (with value 39 to me), I would like to keep a share but also leave something for the opponent so they have incentives to accept. Splitting these roughly in half (giving 2 out of 4 units to the opponent) seems reasonable. In item 5, valued 44 for me, the opponent\u2019s expected value (around 51) is a little higher; granting them 2 of the 5 units can provide them additional incentive while leaving me with the majority (3 units).\n\n3. My proposed offer then is to give the opponent: \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 0 units of item 1 (keeping all 3),\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 2 units of item 2 (keeping 2),\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 All 3 units of item 3,\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 All 4 units of item 4,\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 2 units of item 5 (keeping 3).\n\u2003This division gives me items where my personal value is highest and gives the opponent the items where (if we assume their values are around 51 per unit) the relative gain for them is higher. My own total value from the items I keep is 3\u00d789 + 2\u00d739 + 3\u00d744 = 267 + 78 + 132 = 477, which is comfortably above my outside offer of 103 (and with no discount in round 1). Meanwhile, the opponent\u2019s expected \u201cbasket\u201d is attractive as well.\n\n4. Based on this reasoning I propose an initial offer that is both beneficial for me and likely attractive for Player 2 given the estimated values.\n\nThus my action in round 1 is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 3, 4, 2]}",

Knowing that in each counteroffer you propose the number of units you give to your opponent (with you getting the remainder), you could try to \u201csteal\u201d item\u00a01 for yourself while \u201ccompensating\u201d your opponent so that they are about as well off as in the current offer.\n\nIn the current accepted allocation (if you accepted Player\u00a02\u2019s offer) Player\u00a02 would get the remainder of the items:\n\u2003For item\u00a01: 3 \u2013 0 = 3 units\n\u2003For item\u00a02: 4 \u2013 3 = 1 unit\n\u2003For item\u00a03: 3 \u2013 0 = 3 units\n\u2003For item\u00a04: 4 \u2013 0 = 4 units\n\u2003For item\u00a05: 5 \u2013 2 = 3 units  \nSo their bundle would be [3,1,3,4,3].\n\nA promising idea is to try to \u201cshift\u201d the goods so that you get all of item\u00a01 \u2013 which is very high value for you \u2013 while compensating Player\u00a02 with extra in some other category to keep their overall \u201cpackage\u201d (in terms of expected value) about as attractive as before. Since (on average) each player\u2019s private value for any item is drawn uniformly from 1 to 101 (mean roughly 51), you can imagine that in expectation Player\u00a02\u2019s value of 1 unit of item\u00a01 is comparable to that for, say, item\u00a02. That means if you remove the 3 high\u2010value units of item\u00a01 from their allocation, you have to \u201cpay back\u201d by giving them about 3 extra units of an item they get less of in the current deal.\n\nA workable proposal is as follows. Let your counteroffer specify what you give to Player\u00a02. You propose:\n\u2003\u2022 Give 0 units of item\u00a01 (so you keep all 3)\n\u2003\u2022 Give 4 units of item\u00a02 (instead of the 1 unit they\u2019d get if you accepted)\n\u2003\u2022 Give 3 units of item\u00a03 (as before)\n\u2003\u2022 Give 4 units of item\u00a04 (as before)\n\u2003\u2022 Give 3 units of item\u00a05 (as before)\n\nThen your own allocation (since total amounts are [3,4,3,4,5]) becomes:\n\u2003\u2022 Item\u00a01: 3 \u2013 0 = 3 units\n\u2003\u2022 Item\u00a02: 4 \u2013 4 = 0 units\n\u2003\u2022 Item\u00a03: 3 \u2013 3 = 0 units\n\u2003\u2022 Item\u00a04: 4 \u2013 4 = 0 units\n\u2003\u2022 Item\u00a05: 5 \u2013 3 = 2 units\n\nYour value then is:\n\u20033\u00b789 + 0\u00b739 + 0\u00b711 + 0\u00b76 + 2\u00b744 = 267 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 88 = 355,\nwhich, when discounted (\u00d70.98), gives about 355\u00d70.98 \u2248 348.9 \u2013 substantially better than 200.9.\n\nFor Player\u00a02 the change is that under the current deal they would have gotten [3,1,3,4,3] but under your counteroffer they would get [0,4,3,4,3]. In effect they lose on item\u00a01 (3 units lost) but gain on item\u00a02 (3 additional units compared to before). In expectation (if their per\u2010unit values are roughly average) this \u201cswap\u201d is roughly fair. (Of course, if they highly prize item\u00a01 this deal might seem slightly less attractive \u2013 however, given the uncertainty and the discounting of a further round, they may well be inclined to accept a division that is roughly even in expected terms.)\n\nThis counteroffer is valid and attempts to improve your outcome while offering Player\u00a02 an expected value similar to the current one.

My goal on round\u202f1 as proposer is to \u201cseed\u201d the negotiation by making an offer that gives Player\u00a02 a little more than what\u2013on average\u2013they could expect from waiting (their \u201coutside offer\u201d is drawn uniformly from 1 up to their total value, so roughly half of that total on average). I know my own values for the items:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a01: 18\u2003(4 units available)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a02: 82\u2003(2 units)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a03: 27\u2003(3 units)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a04: 76\u2003(3 units)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a05: 96\u2003(6 units)\nIf I got everything I\u2019d have 1121 in value, and my outside offer is 327. (In later rounds the discount factor (0.98) would reduce any delayed agreement value; here there is no discount in round\u202f1.) \n\nBecause I want to \u201ckeep\u201d as much of the high\u2010value-for-me items while \u201cgiving\u201d Player\u00a02 items that are relatively low in my eyes, I note that items with lower per\u2010unit value for me (items\u00a01 and\u00a03) are natural \u201cconcession\u201d items. (For example, item\u00a01 is only worth 18 to me and item\u00a03 only 27, compared to items\u00a02, 4, and especially 5.) However, if I only hand over these items I end up giving Player\u00a02 7 units total (4 of item\u00a01 plus 3 of item\u00a03). Estimating that Player\u00a02\u2019s \u201caverage\u201d per\u2010unit value is about 51 (the midpoint of a uniform distribution from 1 to 101), 7 units would roughly \u201cvalue\u201d around 357\u2014likely too low compared to an expected outside value (roughly \u00bd of their total, which for a full bundle of 18 units averaging 51 would be around 459). \n\nTo bridge that gap, I need to include a few \u201cextra\u201d units from items that hurt me less. Among the remaining types, item\u00a04 (worth 76 per unit for me) is slightly \u201ccheaper\u201d than item\u00a02 (82) or item\u00a05 (96). Thus I choose to give extra units from item\u00a04. By offering all of items\u00a01 and\u00a03 (4 and 3 units, respectively = 7 units) and then an extra 3 units from item\u00a04 I hand over 10 units overall. (The estimated \u201cvalue\u201d for Player\u00a02 is about 10\u00d751 \u2248 510, which should be a bit above their expected outside offer, thus giving them incentive to settle rather than risk delay.) \n\nThis offer leaves me with item\u00a02 (all 2 units) and item\u00a05 (all 6 units), for which my total value is 2\u00d782 + 6\u00d796 = 164 + 576 = 740. This is a good outcome for me while aiming to make the deal acceptable to Player\u00a02. \n\nAccording to the required format, my round\u202f1 action is as follows:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 0, 3, 3, 0]}",

My private per\u2010unit values are:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 1: 73\u2003\u2003(item total 5; total value = 365)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 2: 3\u2003\u2003 (total 2; value = 6)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 3: 21\u2003\u2003(total 4; value = 84)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 4: 24\u2003\u2003(total 6; value = 144)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 5: 69\u2003\u2003(total 5; value = 345)\n\u2003\u2003The sum of these maximum possible values is 944.\n\n2. My outside option is 476 (and that payment is not discounted). In round 2 any deal reached is discounted by \u03b3 = 0.98 (i.e. my deal value will be about 0.98\u00d7 its \u201craw\u201d value). In the current offer on the table, I would receive [0, 2, 3, 6, 0]. My raw utility would then be:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 1: 0\u00d773 = 0\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 2: 2\u00d73 = 6\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 3: 3\u00d721 = 63\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 4: 6\u00d724 = 144\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 5: 0\u00d769 = 0\n\u2003\u2003Total raw utility = 6 + 63 + 144 = 213, and discounted value \u2248 213\u00d70.98 = 208.7.\nClearly, 208.7 is far less than my outside option of 476.\n\n3. To do better than 476 under discounting, I would need to secure a raw item\u2010value of roughly 476/0.98 \u2248 486 or more. Given the total \u201cpie\u201d is 944 and my own valuations are very high on items 1 and 5, the tempting idea would be to keep almost all of those. However, note that in the current offer Player 2\u2019s allocation (the complement of the current offer) gives them all of item 1 and item 5 (and some of item 3). Because items 1 and 5 are likely very valuable on average to a randomly drawn valuation (since values lie uniformly between 1 and 101), Player 2 is likely to be especially happy with that allocation. So if I try to keep many of those high\u2010value items for myself in a counteroffer, I would have to give up some of them to tempt Player\u00a02 to accept. But then I might end up lowering my own total below the threshold that beats my safe outside offer. \n\nAny counteroffer I design that gives me more than \u2248486 \u201craw\u201d utility (to beat the outside option when discounted) forces me to concede high\u2010value items (items 1 and 5). But giving up enough of these assets makes the offer unattractive to Player\u00a02 because in the current history they are already receiving very attractive portions (e.g. all of items 1 and 5, plus a bit extra on item 3). \n\nThus, any counteroffer that might be acceptable to Player\u00a02 tends to deliver me an outcome worth less than my fallback. My outside option of 476 (which is not discounted) is clearly better than accepting the current offer or risking a counteroffer that Player 2 may reject.\n\n4. Since my current offered deal (208.7 in discounted utility) is so poor relative to my outside option, and any counteroffer that could entangle Player\u00a02 is unlikely to yield me a deal above 476 (after discounting and risk premium), the best move is to WALK away so I secure my outside offer of 476.\n\nTherefore, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

                    "response": "I will explain my thinking briefly. (All details follow \u201cthinking\u2010steps\u201d that lead to my final action.) \n\nI know that if no deal is reached each player gets its \u201coutside offer\u201d value. In my case that is 821 (and my full \u201cpie\u201d (all items) is worth 952 to me). In a full\u2010information world I\u2019d want at least 821 from any deal and, ideally, more. In making the first offer I must \u201ccut\u201d the 18 total items (6,3,5,3,1 per item) between us. Although Player\u00a02\u2019s exact per\u2013unit values are private (drawn uniformly on [1,\u2026,101]) the average is around 51 per unit; roughly speaking if they were \u201caverage\u201d then having 9 items would yield about 9\u00d751\u2248459\u2014roughly the midpoint of their possible \u201coutside offer\u201d (since their maximum full\u2013allocation value would be near 918). (Of course, this is only an approximation.) \n\nSo I want to \u201ckeep\u201d much of the high\u2013value items (to me) while \u201coffering\u201d those items that cost me little. For me the per\u2013unit values are: item1=3 (cheapest) then item3=55, item5=86, item4=93 and item2=98. Thus, to give Player\u00a02 \u201csome\u201d allocation I would prefer to hand over all of item1 (6 units) since that only \u201ccosts\u201d me 6\u00d73=18 points; but then 6 units in expectation (if we assume about 51 per unit to P2) would be worth roughly 306 value to them. To get even closer to what might be acceptable to them (so they do better than their outside offer), I\u2019d need to add extra units. However, if I add too many units I hurt my own net value. \n\nI checked the \u201cminimal\u201d way of \u201cbuying\u201d extra count for Player\u00a02. To have 9 units (the approximate average threshold) I would have to give up 6 units of item1 (must \u2013do, since these are very low\u2013cost) plus 3 extra units. The cheapest extra items beyond item1 are from item3 at cost 55 each (compared with my 3 for item1). Unfortunately, 3 extra units of item3 would \u201ccost\u201d 3\u00d755=165, and the total loss to me would be 18+165=183. That would leave me with 952\u2013183=769, which is below my outside offer of 821. (Any offer giving 9 units to Player\u00a02 forces me into a deal that is worse for me than walking away.) \n\nThus I must \u201csqueeze\u201d the offer so that my final value stays slightly above 821. The best I can do is give away what little count I can while \u201csacrificing\u201d minimal points. That means I give all 6 of item1 (6 units, cost 18) and then add the minimum number of extra units possible and stop before my value falls below 821. For example, giving even one extra unit of any other item costs me at least 55 extra points (if taken from item3). In my analysis the smallest \u201caddition\u201d I can manage while staying just above my \u201creservation\u201d is to give away 6 of item1 plus 2 of item3. That yields a total \u201ccost\u201d of 6\u00d73 + 2\u00d755 = 18+110 = 128, so that I keep 952\u2013128 = 824. This is only 3 points above my outside offer\u2014but that is the best I can do without \u201coverpaying\u201d (or giving away too many units that might boost Player\u00a02\u2019s payoff above what they could get by \u201cwalking\u201d). In expectation, if Player\u00a02 were to \u201cvalue\u201d the items at about 51 per unit, their payoff under my offer would be about 6\u00d751 + 2\u00d751 = 8\u00d751 = 408; while that is somewhat lower than the (unknown) outside value they might get in some cases, it is plausible that if they happen to have a relatively low outside offer they will accept immediately (especially given the discounting that will bite in later rounds). \n\nThus, my initial offer is to \u201cgive\u201d Player\u00a02 this bundle: 6 of item1, 0 of item2, 2 of item3, 0 of item4, and 0 of item5. (I keep the rest.) This offer lets me secure 824 (which is just above my reservation of 821) while \u201ctesting\u201d the waters with P2. \n\nAccordingly, as Player\u00a01 in round 1 I submit my offer as follows:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [6, 0, 2, 0, 0]}",

                    "response": "My analysis is as follows:\n\n1. My total \u201cif I got everything\u201d is 952 in raw terms. In round 2 the discount factor is \u03b3^1 = 0.98, so any deal\u2019s raw payoff is multiplied by 0.98. That means that if I could get nearly all of the items (say my raw total near 950) the discounted value would be about 931. But I must worry about making a counteroffer that Player\u00a02 will accept. (Remember that if Player\u00a02 rejects my counteroffer then \u2013 after some further moves \u2013 the deal may break down and each of us gets our \u201coutside offer\u201d.)\n\n2. The current offer on the table (which Player\u00a02 made in Round\u00a01) gives me [6,1,1,1,0]. My private unit values for items 1\u20135 are [3, 98, 55, 93, 86] so my value for that bundle is \n\u2003\u20036\u00d73 + 1\u00d798 + 1\u00d755 + 1\u00d793 + 0\u00d786 = 18 + 98 + 55 + 93 = 264.\nDiscounted by 0.98 this is about 259 \u2013 far below my own outside offer of 821.\n\n3. As Player\u00a01 I also have an outside offer of 821 (which I get automatically if negotiations break down). Any deal I propose must give me a discounted value higher than 821 while also giving Player\u00a02 at least as much as they could get by \u201cwalking away\u201d (their outside offer).\n\n4. I could in principle try an aggressive counteroffer that gives me almost everything \u2013 for example, keeping items 2,3,4,5 for myself (which add up to 294+275+279+86 = 934) and giving over item 1 (worth only 18 for me). That would yield me 934 raw, or roughly 915 discounted. However, then Player\u00a02\u2019s share would be just item\u00a01 (6 units). Even if 6 units of item 1 had an expected value (from Player\u00a02\u2019s unknown private values) near 6\u00d751 \u2248 306, it is very likely that in many realizations Player\u00a02\u2019s outside offer (which is drawn from 1 up to their total, and on average is around half of their total expected of roughly 918, i.e. near 459) would be higher than what I\u2019d be giving them. Thus it would be quite risky to expect Player\u00a02 to accept such a counteroffer.\n\n5. Given the structure of the negotiation and the fact that if we fail to agree each gets his \u201coutside offer\u201d (and mine is a very strong 821), a risky counteroffer might simply lead to a breakdown of negotiations and force both of us to take our outside offers \u2013 which is already what I am guaranteed if I WALK.\n\n6. With this reasoning, although I might hope for more than 821 with a deal, any counteroffer that tries to reach a higher payoff for me necessarily would give Player\u00a02 too little compared to their likely outside offer \u2013 and thus risk them rejecting. Because of this uncertainty and my strong outside offer, it is safer (and rational in my view) to \u201cWALK\u201d in round 2 and secure my outside offer for 821.\n\nThus, my move is:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Given that an immediate agreement gives us a very decent effective payoff relative to our outside option\u2014and considering the risk that further negotiation may lead to less favorable discounted payoffs\u2014we decide that it is best to ACCEPT the current offer.\n\nThus, my action is:\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

In round 1 a deal is most attractive because there is no discount.\n\u2022 My total value for all items is 1005. In order to do better than my outside offer, I want a deal in which my share exceeds 794.\n\u2022 I value item types differently. My per\u2010unit values are high for item 1 (77) and item 3 (99) and moderate for item 2 (52), but much lower for items 4 (16) and 5 (7). Thus, to give up as little value as possible to myself while still offering Player 2 something attractive (from their likely different private values) I decide to keep all of my high\u2010value items (item 1 and item 3) and be generous on items I care less about.\n\u2022 An intuitive initial offer is to propose that I retain all of item 1 (3 units) and item 3 (6 units), while offering Player 2 full control of the remaining items: all of item 2 (2 units), item 4 (3 units) and item 5 (4 units). \n\u2022 Under this proposal I get items worth 3\u00d777 + 6\u00d799 = 231 + 594 = 825, which beats my outside offer of 794.

                    "response": "I\u2019ll explain my thought\u2010process briefly. (Note: In a full game\u2010theoretic analysis the answer would depend on beliefs about the other agent\u2019s valuation and outside offer\u2014but here I try to \u201cengineer\u201d an offer that gives me a deal that beats my outside option while offering Player\u00a02 enough of the items that tend to be \u201chot\u201d (likely those on which Player\u00a02 might score high thanks to their random draw) to make an immediate acceptance plausible.)\n\nMy private values are very high on items 1 (61 per unit) and 4 (60 per unit) and quite low on items 2 (19 per unit) and 5 (15 per unit). (Item 3, though single\u2010unit and worth 35, plays a modest role.) I want to \u201ckeep\u201d nearly all of the high\u2010value items to secure a total value well above my outside offer of 446. At the same time I want to \u201cgive\u201d Player\u00a02 enough of those items they might care about to overcome the temptation to walk (and their own outside offer might, on average, be roughly in the high 400\u2019s or low 500\u2019s). \n\nA candidate is to give Player\u00a02 most of items on which I do not depend for utility (namely giving them almost all of the 7 units of item\u00a02 and all 3 units of item\u00a05) while keeping a sizable majority of item\u00a01 and all of item\u00a04\u2014except that experience shows that completely \u201cshutting out\u201d a good might make the other player think that you undervalue their interests. To balance these concerns I decide to \u201cconcede\u201d one unit of item\u00a01 and one unit of item\u00a04 to Player\u00a02; this concession is standard in bargaining when each side must have \u201csomething.\u201d \n\nSpecifically, here is the breakdown:\n\n\u2022\u2003Item 1 (total 5): I offer 0 units would give me all 5 (worth 5\u00d761 = 305). However, to \u201csweeten\u201d the deal for Player\u00a02 I may want to concede at least one unit of a \u201chigh\u2010potential\u201d item. (I experimented with that but if I give too many I lose too much value.) In the final version I choose to keep all of item\u00a01.  \n\u2022\u2003Item 2 (total 7): I give 6 out of 7 units to Player\u00a02 since I care little about this item; I keep the remaining 1 (worth 1\u00d719 = 19 for me).  \n\u2022\u2003Item 3 (total 1): I take it all (worth 35).  \n\u2022\u2003Item 4 (total 3): I concede 1 unit to Player\u00a02 (so that Player\u00a02 \u201ctouches\u201d a high\u2010value item) and keep 2 for myself (worth 2\u00d760 = 120).  \n\u2022\u2003Item 5 (total 3): I give all 3 to Player\u00a02 (since it is lower\u2010valued for me).\n\nUnder this proposed division my allocation becomes:\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 5 units (5\u00d761 = 305)\n\u2003\u2003Item 2: 1 unit (1\u00d719 = 19)\n\u2003\u2003Item 3: 1 unit (35)\n\u2003\u2003Item 4: 2 units (120)\n\u2003\u2003Item 5: 0 units (0)\nTotaling 305 + 19 + 35 + 120 = 479, which safely exceeds my outside offer of 446.\n\nAt the same time Player\u00a02 would get:\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 0 units (but I tried various versions; in my final offer I keep all of item\u00a01)\n\u2003\u2003Item 2: 6 units (worth a good deal if their private value is high)\n\u2003\u2003Item 3: 0 units\n\u2003\u2003Item 4: 1 unit (a \u201ctaste\u201d of a high\u2010value item)\n\u2003\u2003Item 5: 3 units\nSo from Player\u00a02\u2019s perspective (using an approximate mean valuation), this looks like a generous enough offer on the items they might value more highly on average.\n\nGiven these considerations and that this is round 1 (i.e. no discounting yet) I now make the initial counteroffer. My offer is valid (each entry is an integer not exceeding the available amount) and it tries to \u201cbalance\u201d getting me a payoff of 479 (above my outside option) while giving Player\u00a02 an attractive enough share so they might accept rather than risk further rounds.\n\nThus, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 6, 0, 1, 3]}",

My private outside offer is 446. (When discounted in round 2, that would yield 446\u00d70.98 \u2248 437.08.) Thus the current offer is well below what I can get if I walk.\n\n3. I therefore must counteroffer if I\u2019m to secure a deal worth more than my fallback. I must design a division that gives me at least 446 in raw (undiscounted) value (which, after discounting, beats the walking value of about 437). Since my total is 698, that means I cannot \u201cgive away\u201d more than 698\u2013446 = 252 (in terms of my valuation).\n\n4. Looking at the history, I see my own round\u20111 proposal was [0,6,0,1,3]. Under that offer my share would be:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Items available: [5,7,1,3,3]\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 P2\u2019s allocation from that offer: [0,6,0,1,3]\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 My allocation (what remains): [5\u20130, 7\u20136, 1\u20130, 3\u20131, 3\u20133] = [5,1,1,2,0].\n\u2003\u2003My value then:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item1: 5\u00d761 = 305\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item2: 1\u00d719 = 19\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item3: 1\u00d735 = 35\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item4: 2\u00d760 = 120\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item5: 0\u00d715 = 0\n\u2003\u2003\u2003Total = 305+19+35+120 = 479.\n\u2003After discounting this round = 479\u00d70.98 \u2248 469.42, which comfortably beats the fallback.\n\u2003Also note that in my original offer I \u201cpaid\u201d a cost of 0\u00d761+6\u00d719+0+1\u00d760+3\u00d715 = 0+114+0+60+45 = 219. That is under the maximum \u201cconcession\u201d of 252 (since 698\u2013479 = 219).\n\n5. Given the current offer from Player 2 gives me only 296 value, it is beneficial for me to counteroffer a division that I originally proposed. It should be acceptable to both parties since it offers P2 a similar share to what they had in round 1 while securing me a better outcome than both the current offer and walking.\n\nThus, my action is to make the counteroffer I proposed in round 1:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 6, 0, 1, 3]}",

(Recall also that in later rounds a discount of \u03b3 = 0.98 applies.)\n\nI am to make the first move. Since there is no current offer on the table, I must propose an initial division of the items. In our \u201coffer\u201d the numbers we list are what Player 2 gets; whatever remains goes to me. Because I place high value on item 5 (81 per unit) and lower value on item 3 (12 per unit) and item 4 (11 per unit), I want to keep most of item 5 while conceding relatively more of the lower\u2010value items so that my opponent gets \u201cenough\u201d so that they may be inclined to accept rather than risk delay. (I have no direct knowledge of Player 2\u2019s private values but know they come from a uniform distribution on 1 to 101, so on average about 51 per item unit. In expectation if all items (except the zero of item 1) were given to Player 2 their \u201cbasket\u201d is 5+5+1+8 = 19 units which would be around 969 total value for someone with average valuations. A fair split in many bargaining solutions might put each party\u2019s share at roughly half of that \u201ctotal\u201d \u2013 but I can tilt the split in my favor by protecting my strength, item 5.)\n\nA rough \u201cfair\u2010value\u201d idea from my perspective is that \u2013 without discounting \u2013 if I split the overall value of 929 about evenly, each party would get around 465 (by my own numbers). But I want to do better than that while still offering Player 2 something that gives them positive expected utility (likely above what they\u2019d expect from their outside offer). Since item 5 is extremely valuable for me, I try to keep most of it. In contrast, I\u2019m willing to \u201ccede\u201d some of item 2 and item 3 (where my per\u2010unit values are higher for item 2 but moderate for item 3) and hand over item 4 entirely (since it is a one\u2010unit item and its absolute contribution is small).\n\nFor instance, consider the following proposed offer:\n\u2003\u2022 Give Player 2 of item 1: 0 units (since none exist).\n\u2003\u2022 Give Player 2 of item 2: 3 units (leaving me 2 units, worth 2\u00d742 = 84).\n\u2003\u2022 Give Player 2 of item 3: 3 units (leaving me 2 units, worth 2\u00d712 = 24).\n\u2003\u2022 Give Player 2 of item 4: 1 unit (the only unit; I forgo it, but it is only worth 11 to me).\n\u2003\u2022 Give Player 2 of item 5: 2 units (leaving me 6 units, worth 6\u00d781 = 486).\n\nThis results in the following payoffs for me:\n\u2003Item 2:\u200384  \n\u2003Item 3:\u200324  \n\u2003Item 4:\u20030  \n\u2003Item 5:\u2003486  \nTotal = 84 + 24 + 486 = 594.\nThis is well above my disagreement payoff of 249.\n\nFor Player 2 the \u201cbasket\u201d is:\n\u2003Item 2:\u20033 units  \n\u2003Item 3:\u20033 units  \n\u2003Item 4:\u20031 unit  \n\u2003Item 5:\u20032 units  \nIf we assume an average per\u2010unit value of roughly 51 (given their uniform draw between 1 and 101), then Player 2\u2019s expected value is approximately 9 units \u00d751 = 459. (While they might\u2014and should\u2014do an internal calculation based on their own numbers, this offer is made to roughly split the surplus while rewarding me for my strength on item 5.)\n\nSince this offer gives me a high utility (594) while offering Player 2 an attractive enough basket (roughly in the \u201cfair\u201d ball\u2010park given the uncertainty in their private values and their own outside offer), I believe it is a reasonable proposal in round 1.\n\nThus, my action is to make the offer:\n\u2003Player 2 receives: [0, 3, 3, 1, 2].\n\nNow I provide my answer in the required format.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 3, 1, 2]}",

In contrast, Player 2\u2019s private values are unknown but drawn uniformly from 1 to 101 so their \u201ctypical\u201d per\u2010unit average is about 51.

Thus, by offering the entire quantity of item 4 (6 units) and all units of item 2 (3 units) to Player 2, I provide them with an expected \u201cbasket\u201d that should be competitive with their fallback while leaving me with all of item 1 (5 units), all of item 3 (3 units) plus item 5 (1 unit). My share then would be calculated as follows:\n \u2022 My share value = 5\u00d767 + 3\u00d766 + 1\u00d755 = 335 + 198 + 55 = 588,\nwhich is well above my outside offer.\n\nPlayer 2 gets:\n \u2022 Item 2: 3 units and Item 4: 6 units.\nBased on their likely average per\u2010unit value (~51), their expected value would be about 3\u00d751 + 6\u00d751 = 9\u00d751 = 459 \u2013 a competitive offer relative to their outside option.\n\nThus, my proposed initial offer (what I give to Player 2) is to give them [0, 3, 0, 6, 0] of items [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] respectively.\n\nMy final action in round 1 is therefore:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 0, 6, 0]}",

Since we are in round 2 the discount factor applies once (\u03b3^(2\u20131) = 0.98). The discounted value is 0.98 \u00d7 534 \u2248 523.32. Compared to your private outside offer of 127, this outcome is much better.\n\nStep 2: Review the history. In round 1 you made an offer of [0, 3, 0, 6, 0]. In that offer you were proposing that you give your opponent nothing of items 1, 0 of item 3 and item 5 \u2013 meaning you keep the \u201cmore valued\u201d items:\n\u2022 Under that proposal your allocation would be the complement:  \n  Total items [5, 3, 3, 6, 1] minus Offered-to-P2 [0, 3, 0, 6, 0]  \n  = [5, 0, 3, 0, 1].\nCalculating your value on that allocation:\n\u2003Item 1: 5 \u00d7 67 = 335  \n\u2003Item 2: 0 \u00d7 44 = 0  \n\u2003Item 3: 3 \u00d7 66 = 198  \n\u2003Item 4: 0 \u00d7 39 = 0  \n\u2003Item 5: 1 \u00d7 55 = 55  \nTotal = 335 + 198 + 55 = 588, with a discounted value of 0.98 \u00d7 588 \u2248 576.24.\n\nStep 3: Comparing the two outcomes  \n\u2022 The current offer gives you roughly 523.3 discounted value.  \n\u2022 Your round\u20101 offer, if accepted, would give you roughly 576.2 discounted value.  \nThus, if you could get your opponent to accept your earlier offer now, you improve your outcome.  \n\nStep 4: Making a counteroffer  \nSince you can propose a counteroffer in round 2 (and doing so means that if the negotiation goes to round 3, you will incur more discounting) it is in your interest to try to \u201cpull\u201d the outcome closer to your favorable division from round 1.  \nThe offer you made earlier \u2013 giving your opponent [0, 3, 0, 6, 0] so that you receive [5, 0, 3, 0, 1] \u2013 is valid and gives you a higher payoff while still providing your opponent with some share of the items (they would get the complement: [5, 0, 0, 0, 1] \u2013 wait, let\u2019s recalc the complement correctly):\n\nRemember that an offer specifies what you will give to Player 2. If you reoffer [0, 3, 0, 6, 0] then:\n\u2003For each item, Player 2 gets the offered units.\n\u2003Player 1 (you) get the remainder = Total \u2013 offer.\nThus, you would get:\n\u2003Item 1: 5 \u2013 0 = 5 units  \n\u2003Item 2: 3 \u2013 3 = 0 units  \n\u2003Item 3: 3 \u2013 0 = 3 units  \n\u2003Item 4: 6 \u2013 6 = 0 units  \n\u2003Item 5: 1 \u2013 0 = 1 unit  \nWhich exactly confirms your earlier allocation (value 588, discounted \u2248576.24).\n\nPlayer 2\u2019s allocation in this counteroffer would be:\n\u2003[0, 3, 0, 6, 0].\n\nWithout knowing their private values, we can\u2019t be sure exactly how they assess these bundles, but it does give them a nonzero share of items (especially items 2 and 4) that might be valuable to them. Since their last offer gave you [5, 0, 1, 2, 1] (leaving them [0, 3, 2, 4, 0]), it seems that you can improve your own share by reverting to your earlier proposal.\n\nStep 5: Decision  \nBecause the counteroffer [0, 3, 0, 6, 0] gives you a higher present value (576.2 vs. 523.3) and still offers your opponent a plausible share relative to their outside option (and given that negotiations tend to gravitate toward balanced outcomes when both parties are rational), you choose to counter.\n\nThus, my action is to COUNTEROFFER specifying the offer [0, 3, 0, 6, 0].\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 0, 6, 0]}",

As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Step 1: I first review the numbers. There are 5 items available in total:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 1: 4 units\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 2: 5 units\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 3: 9 units\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 4: 4 units\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 5: 3 units\n\nMy own per\u2010unit values are:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 1: 69\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 2: 100\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 3: 12\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 4: 85\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 5: 8\n\nThus if I got everything my value would be 1248. My private \u201coutside\u201d offer is 833, so any deal I agree to must leave me with a discounted value (here no discount in round 1) at least as good as 833.\n\nStep 2: In an alternating\u2010offer setting the proposer (me in round 1) has the ability to keep more of the surplus over my fallback. But I also need to \u201cincentivize\u201d Player 2 to accept in round 1 so that they get at least what they expect from waiting (their own outside offer and later bargaining value). I don\u2019t know Player 2\u2019s private values but I do know that their per\u2010unit values are drawn uniformly from 1 to 101; so on average the value per unit is about 51. Thus, if Player 2 got all of an item, their \u201caverage\u201d value would be quantity\u00d751 (roughly).\n\nStep 3: Creating the proposal:\nIt\u2019s smart for me to \u201cgive\u201d Player 2 as much of the items I care least about. I value item 3 at only 12 and item 5 at 8, so these become \u201ccheap\u201d to me but potentially worth roughly 9\u00d751 \u2248 459 and 3\u00d751 \u2248 153 on average to Player 2 if they value them moderately. This sums to about 612 in expected value. However, if Player 2\u2019s own fallback offer tends to be around 637 (given that their total could be about 1275 on average) then 612 might be too low. \n\nTo approximately boost what Player 2 would receive without penalizing myself too much, I consider also \u201cconceding\u201d one unit of an item that I value only modestly above its average (and so the \u201ccost\u201d to me is lower). Item 1 is worth 69 to me but has an average of around 51 to Player 2. Conceding one unit here adds an expected 51 value to them at a cost of 69 to me. This extra piece helps make the proposal a bit more attractive without \u201csacrificing\u201d too many of the items that I value very highly (like items 2 and 4).\n\nStep 4: The proposed division then is:\nOffer to Player 2:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 1: 1 unit\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 2: 0 units (keep these high\u2010value items for me)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 3: 9 units (concede all of it)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 4: 0 units (I favor keeping these)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 5: 3 units (concede all of it)\n\nThat means my allocation would be:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 1: 4 \u2013 1 = 3 units\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 2: 5 (all)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 3: 0 units\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 4: 4 (all)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 5: 0 units\n\nStep 5: Verifying my own payoff:\nMy value becomes:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 1: 3\u00d769 = 207\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 2: 5\u00d7100 = 500\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 4: 4\u00d785 = 340\n\u2003Total = 207 + 500 + 340 = 1047.\nThis is well above my outside offer of 833.\n\nStep 6: Expected attractiveness for Player 2:\nThey would get:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 1: \u22481\u00d751 = 51 (expected)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 3: 9\u00d751 = 459 (expected)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 5: 3\u00d751 = 153 (expected)\nTotal expected \u2248 51 + 459 + 153 = 663.\nThis is plausibly competitive with what they might realize otherwise.\n\nStep 7: As this initial offer gives me roughly 1047 (exceeding my fallback) and gives Player 2 an expected value that might exceed their outside option (helping to secure acceptance), it seems a reasonable first\u2010round offer.\n\nThus, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 9, 0, 3]}",

Let me analyze the situation.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the value of Player 1's offer to me:\n- 1 unit of item 1: 1 \u00d7 18 = 18\n- 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 58 = 116\n- 9 units of item 3: 9 \u00d7 58 = 522\n- 0 units of item 4: 0 \u00d7 19 = 0\n- 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 15 = 30\n\nTotal value of current offer to me: 18 + 116 + 522 + 0 + 30 = 686\n\nWith the discount factor for round 2, this would be worth: 686 \u00d7 (0.98)^(2-1) = 686 \u00d7 0.98 = 672.28\n\nMy outside offer is 113, so this offer is significantly better than walking away.\n\nNow let me evaluate what I would keep under this offer:\n- Items I would keep: [4-1, 5-2, 9-9, 4-0, 3-2] = [3, 3, 0, 4, 1]\n- Value of what I keep: 3\u00d718 + 3\u00d758 + 0\u00d758 + 4\u00d719 + 1\u00d715 = 54 + 174 + 0 + 76 + 15 = 319\n\nThe current offer gives me a total value of 686, which is about 68% of the total possible value (1005). This is quite good for me.\n\nGiven that:\n1. The discount factor will reduce the value further if we continue to round 3\n2. The current offer gives me a much higher value than my outside option\n3. Most of the high-value items (particularly item 3 which is worth 58 per unit to me) are being offered to me\n4. This is already round 2, so we only have one more round after this\n\nI think it's best to accept this offer rather than risk a less favorable outcome or having to walk away in the final round.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

                    "response": "I\u2019ll explain my reasoning briefly. My goal is to get a deal that gives me a present\u2010value above my outside option (956) while \u201cleaving\u201d the other player an amount that might at least beat his secret outside offer. My total value if I got everything is 1402, and my per\u2010unit values are quite skewed: I really prize item\u202f3 (91/unit) and item\u202f4 (89/unit) and then item\u202f1 (70/unit), while I value items\u202f2 (45/unit) and 5 (51/unit) relatively less. (On average the other player\u2019s private per\u2010unit values are about 51, so he \u201cexpects\u201d roughly 51 per unit.) \n\nIn a \u201cwinner\u2010takes\u2010all\u201d proposal I might want to keep for myself nearly all of my high\u2010valued items. However, if I keep too much the other player\u2019s allocation would be very low relative to his likely outside offer. In equilibrium each player will only agree to a division if the deal \u201cbeats\u201d his outside option. (In round\u20091 there is no discounting so we can compare deal value to outside offer directly.) \n\nBecause my outside offer (956) is very high relative to my total value (1402) I must secure myself a deal giving me at least about 956; that usually means I need nearly all of items 3 and 4 plus a little extra \u2013 for example one unit of item\u202f1 would already bring me above that threshold. But if I take nearly all of the high\u2010value items my counteroffer will \u201cleave\u201d very little for the opponent. If I offer him only the \u201clow\u2010value\u201d items (items 2 and 5) he would get 3 units of each (total 6 units); that \u201cpackage\u201d is worth roughly 6\u00d751 \u2248 306 to him in expectation, which is very low compared to the potential outside offer (which, given his total value is around 969, typically might be above 400). \n\nThus I want to give him a bit more. A natural \u201ccompromise\u201d is to concede in a relatively \u201cefficient\u201d way: while items 2 and 5 are already \u201ccheap\u201d for me (45 and 51 versus his expected 51) I can also give him a couple units of item\u202f1 even though I value it at 70 (a concession of 70 vs an expected 51 for him, a loss of 19 per unit for me) so that his expected value rises. \n\nAfter weighing different possibilities I decided on this proposal:\n\u2003\u2022 Give Player 2 2 units of item\u202f1 (so I keep 1 unit),\n\u2003\u2022 Give him all 3 units of item\u202f2,\n\u2003\u2022 Give him all 3 units of item\u202f5,\n\u2003\u2022 And leave items 3 (all 7 units) and 4 (all 3 units) entirely to myself.\n\nThis allocation gives me a total value of:\n\u20031\u00d770 + 7\u00d791 + 3\u00d789 = 70 + 637 + 267 = 974,\nwhich is above my outside option of 956.\nPlayer 2 would receive:\n\u20032 (item 1) + 3 (item 2) + 3 (item 5) = 8 units.\nEven if he evaluates each unit roughly at 51 in expectation (his private values are uniformly distributed between 1 and 101), his \u201cpackage\u201d is worth about 8\u00d751 = 408 in expectation. Although 408 is not high relative to my outside option, I must remember that his actual outside offer is private and could be lower. (Also, in early rounds one might try to \u201ctest the water\u201d by offering a very steep split in one\u2019s favor.) \n\nIn round\u202f1 I have the advantage of setting the initial offer. I thus propose the following division (the offer is the list of units given to Player 2):\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 3, 0, 0, 3]}",

                    "response": "Step\u2010by\u2010step reasoning:\n1. I first calculate what I get if I simply ACCEPT the current offer. The offer gives me:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 3 units of item\u202f1 at 70 each = 210\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 1 unit of item\u202f2 at 45 each = 45\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 0 units of item\u202f3 at 91 each = 0\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 3 units of item\u202f4 at 89 each = 267\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 1 unit of item\u202f5 at 51 each = 51\n\u2003\u2003Sum = 210 + 45 + 0 + 267 + 51 = 573.\nBecause we are in round\u202f2 the discount factor is \u03b3^(2\u20131) = 0.98; so the discounted value is 573\u00d70.98 \u2248 561.5.\n2. My private outside option is 956 (which is not discounted) so an agreement that awards me only roughly 562 (discounted) is far less than what I could get by \u201cwalking away.\u201d\n3. As Player\u202f1 I therefore want to counteroffer in round\u202f2. In our setting an offer is made by specifying the units of each item that you would give to the other party. (What I get is then the remainder of the items.)\n4. My total possible \u201craw\u201d value from all items is \n\u2003\u2003item1: 3\u00d770 = 210, \n\u2003\u2003item2: 3\u00d745 = 135, \n\u2003\u2003item3: 7\u00d791 = 637, \n\u2003\u2003item4: 3\u00d789 = 267, \n\u2003\u2003item5: 3\u00d751 = 153, \n\u2003\u2003and total = 210+135+637+267+153 = 1402.\nTo do better than my outside offer (when discounted in round\u202f2) I must secure a raw value \u201cV\u201d such that 0.98\u00d7V \u2265 956; i.e. V \u2265 about 976. Equivalently, I can give away at most 1402 \u2013 976 = 426 \u201cvalue units\u201d (in my own evaluation).\n5. The current offer on the table (by Player\u202f2) would give me 573 raw value, which is well below what I can guarantee by walking away. Hence I want to propose a counteroffer that shifts much more of the valuable items to me.\n6. I also want to \u201cconcede\u201d items that I value relatively little while keeping almost all of the items that count most for me. My private values are highest on item3 (91) and item4 (89) and moderately high on item1 (70); I value item2 (45) and item5 (51) relatively less.\n7. One natural idea is to give away all of the units of the lower\u2010value items (item2 and item5) and just a little from a moderately valued item (item1) while keeping items 3 and 4 entirely. If I offer Player\u202f2:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 1 unit of item\u202f1 (costing me 70),\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 3 units of item\u202f2 (cost = 3\u00d745 = 135),\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 0 units of item\u202f3,\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 0 units of item\u202f4,\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 3 units of item\u202f5 (cost = 3\u00d751 = 153),\n\u2003\u2003the total \u201cconcession\u201d in my terms is 70+135+153 = 358.\nThen I keep:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item1: (3\u20131)=2 units,\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item2: 0,\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item3: 7,\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item4: 3,\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item5: 0.\nMy raw value then becomes:\n\u2003\u20032\u00d770 + 7\u00d791 + 3\u00d789 = 140 + 637 + 267 = 1044.\nWhen discounted (\u00d70.98) I get about 1023\u2014a clear improvement over the 561 offered now and well above my fallback of 956.\n8. Although I do not know Player\u202f2\u2019s private values, by offering them all of the items I value less (and no share of my highest\u2010value items) I hope to leave them an offer that is at least as attractive as their outside option. (If they reject and \u201cwalk away\u201d, they get their private outside offer. In round\u20052, they face similar discounting issues in subsequent rounds \u2013 so if I propose a take\u2010it\u2010or\u2010leave\u2010it offer that gives them an edge relative to waiting, they are likely to accept.)\n9.

It is Round 3 so the discount is \u03b3^(r\u20131) = 0.98^(3\u20131) = 0.98\u00b2 \u2248 0.9604.  \n\u2003Discounted value = 618 \u00d7 0.9604 \u2248 594\n\nStep 4: Compare this deal to your outside option. Your private outside offer is 956 (which is not discounted in the case of walking away). By accepting the current offer, you\u2019d receive a present value of roughly 594, which is considerably less than your guaranteed 956.\n\nStep 5: Consider risk and alternative actions. In the final round, any counteroffer risks not obtaining a deal \u2014 and if it falls through, you would still rely on your outside offer (956). With a current offer well below your outside option\u2019s value, there\u2019s little incentive to try for a counteroffer.\n\nStep 6: Conclusion  \nSince the current offer yields a value (roughly 594) much lower than your outside option (956), walking away is clearly the best action to secure the higher payoff.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

We note the available items are:\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 4 units\u2003(Item value for us = 68)\n\u2003\u2003Item 2: 6 units\u2003(Item value for us = 42)\n\u2003\u2003Item 3: 5 units\u2003(Item value for us = 53)\n\u2003\u2003Item 4: 3 units\u2003(Item value for us = 33)\n\u2003\u2003Item 5: 3 units\u2003(Item value for us = 1)\n\n2. Our total \u201cprivate\u201d value for all items is 891; our outside option is 458. In round 1 (no delay discount, factor = 1) we must secure a deal that beats our outside option and preferably maximizes our share while still giving Player 2 enough \u201cincentive\u201d to accept.\n\n3. Although we do not know Player 2\u2019s private per\u2010unit values, we assume by symmetry and from a uniform draw that his per\u2011unit values will average roughly 51. Thus his expected full\u2010pie value is around 1071 (the sum of 21 units\u00d7~51) and his outside option (drawn uniformly from 1 to his total) would on average be about half of that \u2013 roughly 535. In order for Player 2 to find an offer acceptable, his share in our proposal should be expected to yield close to or a little above that outside option.\n\n4. At the same time we want to maximize our own payoff. Since our highest\u2010valued items are item 1 and item 3, we prefer to keep them for ourselves. Items that we value less (like item 2, item 4, and especially item 5) are more \u201caffordable\u201d to offer to Player 2.\n\n5. A promising strategy is to propose giving Player 2 all of item 4 (3 units) and all of item 5 (3 units), plus a substantial portion of item 2 \u2013 because item 2 is worth 42 per unit (a moderate loss to us) while potentially having an expected \u201cworth\u201d around 51 to Player 2.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 For example, if we offer him 5 units of item 2, his expected gain (with an average of 51 per unit) is about 255. Adding item 4 (3 \u00d7 ~51 \u2248 153) and item 5 (3 \u00d7 ~51 \u2248 153) yields an expected total of about 561 \u2013 a little above his outside reservation of roughly 535.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 This leaves us with 1 unit of item 2 (minimal loss from 6 units) plus all of item 1 and item 3. Our own allocation then is:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 1: 4 units \u2192 4\u00d768 = 272\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 2: 1 unit \u2192 1\u00d742 = 42\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 3: 5 units \u2192 5\u00d753 = 265\n\u2003\u2003Totaling 272+42+265 = 579, which is comfortably above our outside offer of 458.\n\n6. This division is valid (we do not assign more items than available) and appears to give Player 2 an expected benefit competitive with an outside option while preserving a strong payoff for us.\n\nTherefore, our initial action in round 1 is to propose the offer that gives Player 2:\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 0, Item 2: 5, Item 3: 0, Item 4: 3, and Item 5: 3.\n\nOur response in the required JSON format is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 5, 0, 3, 3]}",

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 5, 0, 3, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 5, 0, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 5, 0, 3]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Step 1: Evaluate the current proposal. The current offer on the table says that you receive [1, 1, 5, 0, 3] units. Using your private per\u2010unit values\u2014\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 1: 1 \u00d7 68 = 68\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 2: 1 \u00d7 42 = 42\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 3: 5 \u00d7 53 = 265\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 4: 0 \u00d7 33 = 0\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 5: 3 \u00d7 1 = 3\nThe total raw value is 68 + 42 + 265 + 0 + 3 = 378. Because we are in round 2, the discount factor is \u03b3^(2\u20131) = 0.98. That means if you accept now, you get 0.98 \u00d7 378 \u2248 370.4 in \u201cpresent\u2010value\u201d terms.\n\nStep 2: Compare with your outside option. Your outside offer is 458 (and if you walk away you\u2019re guaranteed 458). Thus, the current deal (\u2248370) is far below what you can guarantee by walking away. So accepting the current proposal is not attractive.\n\nStep 3: Consider a counteroffer. Because it\u2019s round 2 you have the chance to improve the division in your favor. In round 1 you had offered [0, 5, 0, 3, 3] to Player 2 which would have left you with the complementary split:\n\u2003Total items: [4, 6, 5, 3, 3]\n\u2003Your share would then be: [4, 1, 5, 0, 0]\nThis would give you a raw value of:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 1: 4\u00d768 = 272\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 2: 1\u00d742 = 42\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 3: 5\u00d753 = 265\nTotal = 272 + 42 + 265 = 579, and a discounted value of 0.98\u00d7579 \u2248 567.4.\nHowever, Player 2 did not accept that offer; instead, they countered with one in which you get [1, 1, 5, 0, 3] (so they would keep [3, 5, 0, 3, 0]). \n\nStep 4: Note how the current offer gives Player 2 these items:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 1: 3 units (since 4\u20131 = 3)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 2: 5 units (6\u20131)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 3: 0 (5\u20135)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 4: 3 (3\u20130)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 5: 0 (3\u20133)\nPlayer 2\u2019s proposal leaves you with too little (discounted ~370) compared to your outside option (458). Meanwhile, you value item 1 very highly and would prefer to keep all of those if possible. (Item 1 is 68 per unit for you versus an expected average of about 51 for Player 2.) \nThus, you want to \u201cprice\u2010out\u201d a division that gives you a raw total above roughly 468 (since 0.98\u00d7468 \u2248 458) but still leaves Player 2 at least as well off as what they might expect from waiting or comparing with their own outside offer.\n\nStep 5: Choosing a counteroffer. One natural idea is to \u201crestart\u201d with something close to your original proposal: by offering Player 2 the bundle [0, 5, 0, 3, 3] (which you previously proposed) you would get the complementary allocation [4, 1, 5, 0, 0] worth 579 (raw) or about 567 when discounted. However, note that in their counteroffer Player 2 \u201cclaimed\u201d some of item 1 (3 units) that you very much want. \nA small concession on item 1 might make the offer palatable to Player 2 while still giving you a major share of your high\u2010value items. For example, if you offer them [1, 5, 0, 3, 3] that means:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Player 2 gets: 1 unit of item 1, 5 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 3 of item 4, and 3 of item 5.\n\u2003\u2022\u2003You get the complement:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013\u2003Item 1: 4 \u2013 1 = 3 units \u2192 3\u00d768 = 204\n\u2003\u2003\u2013\u2003Item 2: 6 \u2013 5 = 1 unit \u2192 1\u00d742 = 42\n\u2003\u2003\u2013\u2003Item 3: 5 \u2013 0 = 5 units \u2192 5\u00d753 = 265\n\u2003\u2003\u2013\u2003Item 4: 3 \u2013 3 = 0\n\u2003\u2003\u2013\u2003Item 5: 3 \u2013 3 = 0\n\u2003Total raw value for you = 204 + 42 + 265 = 511, and discounted value \u2248 0.98\u00d7511 \u2248 500.8.\nCompare Player 2\u2019s shares:\n\u2003\u2013 In the current offer on the table, Player 2 receives [3, 5, 0, 3, 0].\n\u2003\u2013 In your counteroffer, they would receive [1, 5, 0, 3, 3].\nSince item 1 and item 5 have the same expected \u201caverage\u201d value (even though you value item 1 more), this counteroffer likely gives Player 2 roughly as much (or even a bit more in expectation because they gain 3 units of item 5 compared to none in the current offer) while allowing you to significantly improve your own payoff relative to the current offer and above your outside option.\n\nStep 6: Decide your action.\nBecause accepting the current offer yields a present value (~370) that is much lower than your outside option (458), you do not want to ACCEPT nor WALK when compared with a counteroffer that offers you about 500 in present value. \n\nThus your step\u2010by\u2010step reasoning leads you to propose a counteroffer of [1,5,0,3,3].\n\nYour final action is therefore:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1,5,0,3,3]}",

Thus, I need to offer them a \u201cbundle\u201d of items that in expectation is worthwhile relative to their likely reservation.\n\nSince I value the items differently from how Player\u00a02 is expected to value them\u2014in particular, per unit my values are:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003item 1: 33 (the cheapest for me)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003item 5: 86 \n\u2003\u2022\u2003item 3: 88 \n\u2003\u2022\u2003item 4: 91 \n\u2003\u2022\u2003item 2: 93 \nit makes sense (if I wish to preserve my own high\u2010value items) to concede the items I find \u201ccheaper\u201d and to give as few units as possible. In fact, if I try to \u201cgive\u201d enough units so that, using an expected 51 per unit for Player\u00a02 to roughly clear a reservation his chance (about 7\u20138 units would be needed), then my concessions (the sum of my private values for those units) would far exceed my maximum allowable concession of 329.\n\nSo (given the information I have) I must be aggressive\u2014offering the smallest possible package from my side (using only the lowest\u2010valued items for me) in order to \u201ctie my own hands\u201d at exactly or just above my outside option.

To keep my concession low while \u201cgiving\u201d a few units (because 2 units or 3 units likely would be seen as too little relative to the typical outside offer of Player\u00a02) I can target a total of 4 units. The smallest\u2010cost combination using 4 units is: \n\u2003\u2013 item 1 (1 unit: 33) \n\u2003\u2013 item 5 (2 units: 2\u00d786 = 172) \n\u2003\u2013 one additional unit from item 3 (1\u00d788 = 88).\n\nThat package has a total \u201ccost\u201d of 33+172+88 = 293 (which is below my 329 \u201cconcession\u201d budget), leaving me with the remaining items:\n\u2003\u2013 all of item\u202f2 (2 units), \n\u2003\u2013 the remaining 6 units of item\u202f3, and\n\u2003\u2013 all of item\u202f4 (3 units).\nMy total value for those is 2\u00d793 + 6\u00d788 + 3\u00d791 = 186 + 528 + 273 = 987, which is above my outside offer of 951.\n\nEven though the expected value (using an average of 51 per unit) of the package I\u2019m offering to Player\u00a02 is only about 4\u00d751 = 204, I must be as aggressive as possible as first mover because I want to \u201canchor\u201d the negotiation in my favor and ensure I never get less than 951. (Player\u00a02 may later counteroffer if their own private numbers make my opening \u201coffer\u201d undesirable to them.)\n\nThus, in round\u00a01 I propose the division where I offer Player\u00a02:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u202f1: 1 unit (full)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u202f2: 0 units (I keep both)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u202f3: 1 unit (out of 7)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u202f4: 0 units (I keep all)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u202f5: 2 units (full)\n\nThis initial offer is represented as the list [1, 0, 1, 0, 2].\n\nMy final answer is therefore:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 0, 2]}",

                    "response": "I\u2019ll explain my reasoning briefly. My current \u201coffer on the table\u201d (the one from Player\u202f2) would give me the bundle\n\u2003\u2003item1: 0\u2003item2: 1\u2003item3: 4\u2003item4: 0\u2003item5: 1.\nUsing my private per\u2010unit values (33, 93, 88, 91, 86 respectively) that gives me a raw (undiscounted) value of\n\n\u2003\u20030\u00b733 + 1\u00b793 + 4\u00b788 + 0\u00b791 + 1\u00b786 = 93 + 352 + 86 = 531.\nSince we are in round 2 the outcome would be multiplied by \u03b3 = 0.98 so its present value is about 520 \u2013 far below my private outside offer of 951.\n\nI therefore need to \u201ccounter\u201d with a proposal that (when multiplied by 0.98) gives me at least as much as the 951 fallback. In other words, I want my own raw value to be at least roughly 951/0.98 \u2248 970. (In fact, I want a deal that is strictly better than what I\u2019d get by \u201cwalking.\u201d)\n\nBecause the total amounts are fixed we must \u201cdivide\u201d the items. I know my total available raw value (if I got everything) would be\n\n\u2003\u20031\u00b733 + 2\u00b793 + 7\u00b788 + 3\u00b791 + 2\u00b786 = 1280.\nSo if I try to \u201creallocate\u201d items I want to keep those I value highly. In my evaluation the most \u201cprecious\u201d items are item2 (93 per unit) and item4 (91 per unit) while item1 (33 per unit) is relatively \u201ccheap.\u201d Also item3 (88) and item5 (86) are fairly close but even a small concession in them costs me many points.\n\nMy strategy is to \u201cclaim\u201d all of item2 and item4 for myself (thus offering 0 units of these to Player\u202f2) and then be as stingy as possible with items from items1,3,5 in order to push my raw total near or above 970 while giving just enough to (hopefully) induce Player\u202f2 to agree immediately (knowing that if the deal fails we\u2019d both get our outside offers and a further discount would apply in round\u202f3). By \u201cgiving away\u201d the lowest\u2010valued items to me, I can \u201cbuy\u201d acceptance. In my calculation I can \u201cafford\u201d to lose roughly 311 raw value points (since 1280 \u2013 970 \u2248 310) while still beating my outside offer when discounted.\n\nA least\u2010cost approach is then to concede:\n\u2003\u2013 all of item1 (1 unit, cost 33),\n\u2003\u2013 all of item5 (2 units, cost 2\u00d786 = 172),\n\u2003\u2013 and one unit out of item3 (cost 88).\nThat total concession amounts to 33 + 172 + 88 = 293, which is under my \u201cbudget\u201d of roughly 310 points.\nUnder this proposal my allocation would be determined by subtracting what I \u201cgive\u201d from the totals. In other words, if I \u201coffer\u201d Player\u202f2 the bundle\n\u2003\u2003[item1, item2, item3, item4, item5] = [1, 0, 1, 0, 2]\nthen my own allocated bundle is\n\u2003\u2003[1\u20131, 2\u20130, 7\u20131, 3\u20130, 2\u20132] = [0, 2, 6, 3, 0].\n\nI then get a raw \u201cworth\u201d of:\n\u2003\u20030\u00b733 + 2\u00b793 + 6\u00b788 + 3\u00b791 + 0\u00b786 = 186 + 528 + 273 = 987.\nWhen discounted (\u00d7 0.98) the present value is about 987\u00d70.98 \u2248 967, which is just above the threshold (recall we need roughly 970 raw, and 967 is close; in practice, even a marginal improvement is worthwhile compared to the 520 \u201cdeal\u201d under the current offer).\n\nI realize that this counteroffer \u201csqueezes\u201d Player\u202f2 (they would receive only 1 unit of item1, 1 of item3 and both units of item5 \u2013 a total of 4 units \u2013 whereas in the current offer they\u2019d be getting items that sum to 9 units of the available 15). But given my very strong outside option (951) and that a round\u20113 delay would further discount any eventual deal, I must be tough. (Of course, Player\u202f2\u2019s private values are unknown to me, but this is the best \u201ccalculated\u201d division from my view.)\n\nThus, my decision in round 2 is to make the following counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 0, 2]}",

Because we are in round 3, the discount factor applies with exponent (r \u2013 1) = 2: 0.98\u00b2 \u2248 0.9604. Thus, the present value of the current deal is about 443 \u00d7 0.9604 \u2248 425.\n\n3. Your private outside offer is 951, which is much higher than approximately 425 from the current offer.\n\n4. In this final round, trying to counteroffer might risk getting no deal at all (or the other player forcing a walk), meaning you\u2019d still get 951. It is hard to imagine a counteroffer that, once accepted, would give you a negotiated value above 951 (since even if you got nearly all items, the maximum pre-discount value is 1280 yielding about 1228 when discounted, but obtaining that would require giving up almost everything to the other player \u2013 which would not be acceptable for them).\n\n5.

                    "response": "I'll explain my reasoning briefly. My overall total (if I got every unit) would be 6\u00b738 + 1\u00b765 + 4\u00b799 + 4\u00b711 + 3\u00b743 = 862. I also have an outside option worth 742, so any negotiated deal must leave me with at least 742 in my own (discount\u2010adjusted) value. At the same time I must give Player\u00a02 an allocation that they prefer over (or at least equal to) their unknown outside offer (drawn uniformly between 1 and their full\u2010pie value). Because I know my own values, I want to \u201cbuy\u201d as little as possible while still reaching slightly above 742 (here I aim for about 748) so I keep most of the \u201chigh\u2010value\u201d goods for me. For example, item\u00a03 is very \u201cvaluable\u201d to me (99 per unit) so I want to keep all 4 of item\u00a03. I also get a boost by keeping item\u00a02 (65 per unit) and most of item\u00a01 (38 per unit). Items that I value relatively less (like item\u00a04, at 11 per unit) are the natural candidates to offer to Player\u00a02. (I also note that item\u00a05 is intermediate (43 per unit); giving up one unit there is a modest sacrifice.)  \n\nOne offer that works out is as follows. I propose to give Player\u00a02:\n\u2003\u2022\u20031 unit of item\u00a01 (worth 38 to me),\n\u2003\u2022\u20030 units of item\u00a02,\n\u2003\u2022\u20030 units of item\u00a03,\n\u2003\u2022\u20033 units of item\u00a04 (3\u00d711=33), and\n\u2003\u2022\u20031 unit of item\u00a05 (43).  \n\nThen my allocation is the remainder:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003item\u00a01: 6\u20131 = 5 units (5\u00d738 = 190)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003item\u00a02: 1\u20130 = 1 unit (65)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003item\u00a03: 4 units (4\u00d799 = 396)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003item\u00a04: 4\u20133 = 1 unit (11)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003item\u00a05: 3\u20131 = 2 units (2\u00d743 = 86)\n\nMy total value becomes 190+65+396+11+86 = 748, which beats my outside offer of 742 while \u201cbuying\u201d Player\u00a02\u2019s acceptance with items (preferably ones where my loss is low). Although I don\u2019t know Player\u00a02\u2019s exact values, the bundle of 1 unit of item\u00a01, 3 units of item\u00a04, and 1 unit of item\u00a05 gives them some positive value that (given the randomness of their values) might well exceed their outside offer. (Of course, their private draw might be high, but this initial offer is aggressive yet leaves me barely above my reservation.)  \n\nThus, my action in round 1 is to propose this counteroffer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 3, 1]}",

My outside offer is 742 (which I get immediately if I WALK).

My raw value for that would be\n\u2003\u20031\u00d738 + 1\u00d765 + 2\u00d799 + 3\u00d711 + 0\u00d743 = 38 + 65 + 198 + 33 = 334\nand discounted that is 334\u00d70.98 \u2248 327, which is well below my safe outside offer of 742.\n\nTo beat my outside option I need a deal that nets me, after discounting, at least 742. In other words, if X is my raw value then 0.98\u00d7X \u2265 742, so X must be at least about 757. Given my value weights the highest are item 3 (99 per unit), then item 2 (65) and item 5 (43), I want to secure those entirely. For example, if I take:\n\u2003\u2003all 4 units of item 3\u2003\u2003 \u2192 4\u00d799 = 396\n\u2003\u2003the 1 unit of item 2\u2003\u2003\u2003 \u2192 65\n\u2003\u2003all 3 units of item 5\u2003\u2003 \u2192 3\u00d743 = 129\nthe sum so far is 396+65+129 = 590.\nThat leaves me needing about 167 more raw value. Item 1 gives 38 per unit, so claiming 5 units (5\u00d738 = 190) would raise my total raw value to 590+190 = 780, which when discounted yields 780\u00d70.98 \u2248 764.4 \u2013 comfortably above my outside option.\n\nSince the overall item totals are [6,1,4,4,3], if I get [5,1,4,0,3] then Player 2 gets the remaining [1,0,0,4,0].\n\nBased on this, I propose a counteroffer that offers Player 2 [1, 0, 0, 4, 0].

                    "response": "I want to propose an offer that makes it worthwhile for Player\u00a02 to accept immediately while leaving me with as much value as possible. I start by noting that if I \u201cwin\u201d the negotiation (i.e. if no deal is reached) I get my outside\u2010offer of 325. In contrast, if we agree now (in round\u00a01, with no discounting) I\u2019d like to improve on that. My total value if I got everything is 1057, so I\u2019d like a deal that gives me more than 325\u2014and preferably as high a share as possible while \u201cbuying\u201d Player\u00a02\u2019s agreement.\n\nI also know that our value per unit of each item is different. My private values are:\n\n\u2003\u2022 Item\u00a01: 51  \n\u2003\u2022 Item\u00a02: 11  \n\u2003\u2022 Item\u00a03: 63  \n\u2003\u2022 Item\u00a04: 16  \n\u2003\u2022 Item\u00a05: 53\n\n(with available quantities 7, 5, 3, 2, 8 respectively). Player\u00a02\u2019s per\u2010unit values are unknown but drawn uniformly from 1 to 101. (On average, if we assume roughly 51 per unit for him, his total \u201cpie\u201d is expected to be about 1275.) In a \u201cfair\u201d division (by his likely perspective) he might expect around half (\u2248637\u2013638) of that value if he got all items. But since I wish to skew the division in my favor I want to \u201cpay\u201d Player\u00a02 just enough.\n\nI note that I incur little \u201ccost\u201d in giving up items for which my private value is low relative to his likely average. In particular, my valuations for item\u00a02 (11) and item\u00a04 (16) are much lower than his expected 51 per unit; so conceding these is \u201ccheap\u201d for me and increases his value substantially. In contrast, I would lose more by giving away items for which I value them highly (items\u00a01, 3, and 5). \n\nOne idea is as follows. I give him all of item\u00a02 (all 5 units) and all of item\u00a04 (both units). In my book this costs me:\n\u2003\u2013 Item\u00a02: 5\u00d711 = 55  \n\u2003\u2013 Item\u00a04: 2\u00d716 = 32  \nTotal \u201ccost\u201d = 87, while (if his value were about 51 per unit) he gains:\n\u2003\u2013 Item\u00a02: 5\u00d751 = 255  \n\u2003\u2013 Item\u00a04: 2\u00d751 = 102  \nTotal \u2248357.\n\nThat 357 is well short of what he might expect from a \u201cfair\u201d division (\u2248638), so I need to give him a bit more. One efficient option is to give him 6 out of 7 units of item\u00a01. That would add about 6\u00d751 = 306 to his side (if we use the rough 51 per unit estimate). Then his \u201cpackage\u201d would be worth approximately 255 (item\u00a02) + 102 (item\u00a04) + 306 (item\u00a01) = 663\u2014just a bit above what we might think of as a fair half. \n\nIn this deal my allocation would be the complement:  \n\u2003\u2022 Item\u00a01: I keep 1 unit (1\u00d751 = 51)  \n\u2003\u2022 Item\u00a02: I keep 0  \n\u2003\u2022 Item\u00a03: I keep all 3 units (3\u00d763 = 189)  \n\u2003\u2022 Item\u00a04: I keep 0  \n\u2003\u2022 Item\u00a05: I keep all 8 units (8\u00d753 = 424)\n\nTotaling 51 + 189 + 424 = 664 for me, which is far above my outside offer and quite favorable given the overall \u201cpie\u201d size.\n\nThus, as my initial offer I propose giving Player\u00a02:\n\n\u2003\u2022 6 units of item\u00a01  \n\u2003\u2022 5 units of item\u00a02  \n\u2003\u2022 0 units of item\u00a03  \n\u2003\u2022 2 units of item\u00a04  \n\u2003\u2022 0 units of item\u00a05\n\nThis is a valid offer (each number is no more than the available amount) and represents a \u201ccounteroffer\u201d in round\u00a01.\n\nSo my answer is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [6, 5, 0, 2, 0]}",

When dividing them, I must choose a split that gives me the most total value (using my private per\u2010unit values) while still giving Player 2 enough (compared to his outside offer and his future prospects) so he will accept rather than try to delay or walk away.\n\u2022 I know my valuations: item 1 is worth 17/unit, item 2 is 49/unit, item 3 is 70/unit, item 4 is 85/unit, and item 5 is 51/unit. In total I could get 1137 if I got every item, but my disagreement payoff is only 46. In a multi\u2010round setting with discounting (\u03b3 = 0.98) even a small delay matters, so I want to propose a division that is \u201cjust enough\u201d for Player 2.\n\u2022 A \u201cfair\u201d split (splitting the items roughly equally) would be to offer Player 2 a bundle that gives him nearly half the total value from my perspective. For example, if I split each pile almost equally (rounded to integers) then Player 2\u2019s bundle \u2013 for instance, 2 units of item 1 (of 4), 2 of item 2 (of 5), and 2 units each of items 3, 4, and 5 \u2013 would leave me with the remainders. In that split I would get: item 1: 2 units (2\u00d717 = 34), item 2: 3 units (3\u00d749 = 147), item 3: 2 units (2\u00d770 = 140), item 4: 2 units (2\u00d785 = 170), and item 5: 2 units (2\u00d751 = 102). That totals 593 in my valuation, and Player 2 would get roughly 2 units of each item: 2\u00d717 + 2\u00d749 + 2\u00d770 + 2\u00d785 + 2\u00d751 \u2248 34+98+140+170+102 = 544.\n\u2022 As the first mover I have an incentive to be a bit more aggressive so I can extract extra value. Thus I can try offering Player 2 a slightly smaller share that still gives him an attractive bundle to avoid later discounting issues. For instance, if I offer Player 2 one less unit on an item where its marginal value to me is low (and hoping that it is \u201cjust enough\u201d for him), I can increase my own share.\n\u2022 One candidate initial offer is: give Player 2 1 unit of item 1, 2 units each of items 2, 3, 4, and 5. Then my allocation becomes the remainder: 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n\u2022 In my valuation that yields:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 For me: 3\u00d717 + 3\u00d749 + 2\u00d770 + 2\u00d785 + 2\u00d751 = 51 + 147 + 140 + 170 + 102 = 610.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 For Player 2: 1\u00d717 + 2\u00d749 + 2\u00d770 + 2\u00d785 + 2\u00d751 = 17 + 98 + 140 + 170 + 102 = 527.\n\u2022 This offer is a bit more favorable to me than the \u201cfair split\u201d and should be acceptable for Player 2 given that his outside option is likely lower than what he gets here (and further delay would incur discounting).\n\u2022 Therefore, in round 1 I will make the following counteroffer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 2, 2, 2]}",

However, I have an outside offer of 529 so any deal must give me at least a little more than that. \n\nStep 2: I also understand that Player 2\u2019s private values are drawn uniformly from 1 to 101. The expected per\u2010unit value (about 51) makes their total expected value roughly 26\u00d751 \u2248 1326, and on average (given their outside offer is drawn uniformly from 1 to their total value) their reserve might be around half of that (roughly 663). In order to get them to agree now (without any discounting\u2014we are at round 1, so no discount yet) I should offer them a bundle that roughly \u201cadds up\u201d to about 13 units of goods (13\u00d751 \u2248 663 expected value). (In our setting the \u201csize\u201d in units is a rough proxy for expected money\u2010equivalent to them, since we have no further details on their preferences.) \n\nStep 3: Since I want to maximize my value while keeping at least a minimal surplus for Player 2 (so that they prefer immediate agreement over waiting for their outside option), I want to keep nearly all the items that matter most to me. \n\nLooking at my private values:\n\u2003\u2022 I value item 5 the highest (48 per unit) and item 3 close behind (39 per unit). \n\u2003\u2022 Items 1 (20) and 2 (25) are lower\u2013valued for me, and item 4 is almost worthless (1 per unit).\n\nThus a natural idea is to give Player 2 everything in the low\u2010value categories from my perspective (items 1, 2, and 4) while giving up only a few units in the \u201cmiddle\u201d category (item 3) and keeping all of item 5.\n\nStep 4: Concretely, consider this proposal:\n\u2003\u2022 Let Player 2 have all of items 1, 2, and 4. That is, give them 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, and 3 units of item 4.\n\u2003\u2022 To \u201ctop up\u201d their bundle and make it roughly equivalent to 13 total units (since 4+4+3 = 11), also give them 2 units of item 3.\n\u2003\u2022 Give them nothing of item 5.\n\nThus, my offer to Player 2 is the vector:\n\u2003[4, 4, 2, 3, 0].\n\nLet\u2019s check the numbers:\n\nFor me, I will keep:\n\u2003\u2022 item 1: 4 \u2013 4 = 0 units\n\u2003\u2022 item 2: 4 \u2013 4 = 0 units\n\u2003\u2022 item 3: 11 \u2013 2 = 9 units\u2003\u2192 value: 9\u00d739 = 351\n\u2003\u2022 item 4: 3 \u2013 3 = 0 units\n\u2003\u2022 item 5: 4 \u2013 0 = 4 units\u2003\u2192 value: 4\u00d748 = 192\n\nTotal value for me = 351 + 192 = 543, which is above my outside offer of 529.\n\nFor Player 2, the \u201csize\u201d of their bundle in units is:\n\u2003\u2022 item 1: 4, item 2: 4, item 3: 2, item 4: 3, item 5: 0, giving a total of 13 units.\nIf we assume roughly 51 per unit, that bundle is worth about 13\u00d751 = 663 in expected terms\u2014on average matching what they might expect from their own outside offer.\n\nStep 5: Because this proposal gives me 543 (a slight improvement over my fallback) and it gives Player 2 an expected value around 663 (around their reservation), it is a reasonable initial offer. \n\nSince I am the first mover and must propose an offer (or WALK), I now submit the offer in the required format.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 4, 2, 3, 0]}",

We note that the current offer on the table (which gives us [2, 1, 9, 3, 0]) would award us a nominal value computed as:\n\u2003\u200320\u00d72 + 25\u00d71 + 39\u00d79 + 1\u00d73 + 48\u00d70 = 40 + 25 + 351 + 3 + 0 = 419.\n\u2003\u2003Because we are in round 2 the agreement\u2019s final payoff is discounted by \u03b3^(2\u20131) = 0.98, so the \u201cpresent\u201d value would be about 0.98\u00d7419 \u2248 410.6.\n\n2. Our private outside alternative is 529. This means that if we \u201cwalk\u201d now, we are guaranteed 529\u2014which is substantially better than 410.6.\n\n3. One might consider making a counteroffer to try to \u201cpush\u201d the outcome closer to our ideal (which is to receive as many items as possible in those where our values are high) while offering just enough to entice Player 2. For example, in our round\u20101 offer we had proposed [4, 4, 2, 3, 0] (which would have left us with [0,0,9,0,4] for a value of 543 nominal, or 543\u00d70.98 \u2248 532 if reached in round\u00a02). However, Player 2 already rejected that offer in favor of their own counteroffer ([2, 1, 9, 3, 0]), which from our perspective would give them a complementary bundle valued around 385. Any counteroffer that pushes much further toward our interests (i.e. reducing what Player 2 gets) risks rejection by Player 2\u2014and if they reject we\u2019d eventually end up with our outside alternative (which is 529).\n\n4. Essentially, the current deal gives us only 410.6 while any counteroffer that might improve our nominal share (say, aiming for around 540 nominal for us) would likely cut too deeply into Player 2\u2019s bundle relative to what they already demanded. Given that our own outside option (529) is safely better than the current deal and that pushing the envelope further might risk no deal at all, it appears that our best guaranteed payoff is obtained by walking away.\n\n5. Thus, given that the current offer yields far less than the outside alternative and the risks of a counteroffer are high, our decision is to WALK away. \n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

                    "response": "I\u2019ll explain my thinking briefly. My goal is to propose an offer that beats my own outside option (674) while giving Player\u00a02 a package that\u2014given that their own private item\u2010values are drawn uniformly from 1 to 101\u2014is likely to be at least as good as what they might \u201cget for sure\u201d from their outside option. (Because if negotiations fail each gets its outside offer, with my being 674 and theirs unknown but on average roughly half of their maximum total value.) \n\nMy total item bundle is worth 1101 for me; however, not every item is \u201cworth\u201d as much to me relative to what a typical opponent might expect. Here are my values per unit and (roughly) the \u201caverage\u201d value a random type would get (about 51, since values are uniform on [1,101]):\n\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a01: 32 (\u201319 relative to 51)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a02: 26 (\u201325)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a03: 93 (+42)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a04: 14 (\u201337)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a05: 30 (\u201321)\n\nThus my \u201ccomparative advantage\u201d is strongly in item\u00a03. (In fact, if I could take only item\u00a03 I\u2019d get 7\u00d793 = 651, which, however, is slightly below my outside offer.) So I must \u201cpick up the slack\u201d by also taking at least a little bit of another item. Of the remaining items, item\u00a01 is \u201cleast bad\u201d in that if I take it I add 32 to my value whereas if Player\u00a02 got it (and we assume their unit is worth on average 51) they get more. So to barely beat my fallback I can plan to keep all of item\u00a03 and also keep item\u00a01. That gives me a total of 651 + 32 = 683, which is a modest improvement over my outside offer of 674.\n\nThen, for Player\u00a02\u2019s package, I give them the remaining items \u2013 namely the full quantities of items 2, 4, and 5. If one imagines that for them each unit is worth roughly 51 on average, then their \u201cpackage\u201d is about 7 + 4 + 6 = 17 units worth roughly 867. That should be attractive to them relative to their outside offer. (More exactly, even though their private weights might vary, this package is \u201cgenerous enough\u201d so that they would prefer to agree now, rather than wait another round with discounting.)\n\nThus my initial offer is to give Player\u00a02:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a01: 0 units\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a02: 7 units\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a03: 0 units\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a04: 4 units\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a05: 6 units\n\nBy doing so I keep:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a01: 1 unit\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a03: 7 units\nand thereby achieve a value of 32 + 651 = 683 for myself, just above 674, while giving Player\u00a02 a \u201cbig\u201d bundle (all of items 2,4,5) that they should view as attractive.\n\nTherefore, my round\u20111 action is to offer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 7, 0, 4, 6]}",

                    "response": "I'll begin by explaining my reasoning. I note that there are a total of 2 units of item\u202f1, 2 units of item\u202f2, 1 unit of item\u202f3, 4 units of item\u202f4, and 5 units of item\u202f5. My private per\u2010unit values are:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003item\u202f1: 86\u2003\u2003(2 units \u2192 172 total)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003item\u202f2: 23\u2003\u2003(2 units \u2192 46 total)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003item\u202f3: 53\u2003\u2003(1 unit  \u2192 53 total)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003item\u202f4: 9\u2003\u2003 (4 units \u2192 36 total)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003item\u202f5: 80\u2003\u2003(5 units \u2192 400 total)\nwhich sum to 707 if I got everything. My outside offer is 473, so I must do at least as well as 473 (discount factor \u03b3^(0)=1 in round\u202f1). In devising my initial offer I also must \u201cbuy\u201d Player\u202f2\u2019s agreement. Although I do not know Player\u202f2\u2019s exact values, in expectation a uniformly drawn value per unit from 1 to 101 averages about 51. Their total expected value is then roughly like:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003item\u202f1: 2\u00d751 = 102\n\u2003\u2022\u2003item\u202f2: 2\u00d751 = 102\n\u2003\u2022\u2003item\u202f3: 1\u00d751 = 51\n\u2003\u2022\u2003item\u202f4: 4\u00d751 = 204\n\u2003\u2022\u2003item\u202f5: 5\u00d751 = 255\ngiving approximately 714 in total. Their private outside offer is uniformly drawn from 1 to their total value so its expected value is about half \u2013 roughly 357. (There\u2019s uncertainty, but I want my initial offer to give them roughly at least this much \u201cexpected\u201d value by their own estimates so that accepting now is attractive.)\n\nI prefer to keep the items that are especially valuable to me and to concede those on which my own value is low. For me the cheapest items are item\u202f4 (9 per unit) and item\u202f2 (23 per unit). It is relatively \u201ccheap\u201d (in my own valuation) to give away these, whereas item\u202f1 and item\u202f5 have high values (86 and 80 respectively). Item\u202f3 is moderate (53 per unit). \n\nOne simple approach is to propose giving Player\u202f2 all of item\u202f2 and all of item\u202f4. That would yield me the following if I kept the rest:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003My allocation: item\u202f1 (2 units = 172), item\u202f3 (1 unit = 53), item\u202f5 (5 units = 400)\u2003\u2192 total = 625.\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Player\u202f2\u2019s allocation (by my \u201cpoint of view\u201d): item\u202f2 (2 units = 46), item\u202f4 (4 units = 36)\u2003\u2192 total = 82.\nHowever, while 625 is much better than my outside offer, giving Player\u202f2 only items that are \u201ccheap\u201d for me would likely be unattractive to them. Based on the expected per\u2010unit value of about 51 for them, having just item\u202f2 (expected 102) and item\u202f4 (expected 204) sums to roughly 306 \u2013 far below the 357 they might expect from their outside offer. \n\nSo I need to add at least one more unit from an item that doesn\u2019t \u201ccost\u201d me too much. Comparing item\u202f3 (worth 53 to me) and item\u202f1 (worth 86), item\u202f3 is the cheaper concession. Thus, if I also give Player\u202f2 the sole unit of item\u202f3, then from their perspective they\u2019d be getting approximately:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003item\u202f2: 2 units \u2192 expected 102,\n\u2003\u2022\u2003item\u202f3: 1 unit  \u2192 expected 51,\n\u2003\u2022\u2003item\u202f4: 4 units \u2192 expected 204,\nsumming to roughly 357 \u2013 very nearly what they would expect from their outside option.\n\nIn this proposal my retained bundle is:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003item\u202f1: 2 units,\u2003item\u202f5: 5 units,\nwhich (by my values) gives me 2\u00d786 + 5\u00d780 = 172 + 400 = 572, safely above my reservation level of 473.\n\nThus, my initial offer \u2013 expressed as the amount of each item I\u2019m offering to Player\u202f2 \u2013 is to give them 0 units of item\u202f1, 2 units of item\u202f2, 1 unit of item\u202f3, 4 units of item\u202f4, and 0 units of item\u202f5.\n\nI now provide my answer in the required format.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 1, 4, 0]}",

In contrast, my private outside option is 473 (and that is not discounted). So accepting now would be much worse than walking away.\n\nI therefore want to counteroffer. In our full set the items total \n\u2003\u2003item1:2, item2:2, item3:1, item4:4, item5:5,\nand my own unit values are \n\u2003\u2003item1:86, item2:23, item3:53, item4:9, item5:80.\nTo get an outcome that beats my outside option I need a raw total (before discounting) of at least roughly 473/0.98 \u2248 483. I want to keep as many of the high\u2010value items (items 1, 3, and 5) as possible. I also note that item4 is very low for me (only 9 per unit) and item2 is relatively low (23 per unit) so I can be generous with those.\n\nOne natural aggressive idea is to \u201cclaim\u201d all of the items for which my value is very high and only offer player 2 the items that I care least about. For example, if I were to keep:\n\u2003\u2003item1: all 2 (worth 2\u00d786 = 172),\n\u2003\u2003item3: the single unit (worth 53),\n\u2003\u2003and most of item5\u2014say 4 out of 5 (worth 4\u00d780 = 320)\u2014\nthen I would get a raw total of 172 + 53 + 320 = 545.\nAt round 2 this would be valued at 0.98\u00d7545 \u2248 533, which beats my outside offer.\nThis allocation means I must offer the rest to player 2. That is, I would give player 2:\n\u2003\u2003item1: 0 (so they get 2 \u2013 0 = 2),\n\u2003\u2003item2: all 2 (since I\u2019m willing to concede these low\u2010value items),\n\u2003\u2003item3: 0 (so they get 1),\n\u2003\u2003item4: all 4 (they get 4 \u2013 4 = 0, because I take none),\n\u2003\u2003item5: 1 (so they get 5 \u2013 1 = 4).\n\nThus my counteroffer (i.e. the list of items I am offering to player 2) becomes:\n\u2003\u2003[0, 2, 0, 4, 1].\n\nAssuming that player 2\u2019s private values make the package [2 units of item1, 2 units of item2, 1 of item3, 0 of item4, and 4 of item5] attractive compared to their own outside option, this counteroffer secures me a deal with an effective value (after discounting) of about 533, which is preferable to both the current offer and my outside option.\n\nTherefore, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 0, 4, 1]}",

My highest value items are 1, 2, and 5.\n\nI should keep most of my high-value items (1, 2, and 5) and offer Player 1 my lower-value items (3 and 4).\n\nMy counteroffer will be to give Player 1:\n[0, 0, 1, 4, 1]\n\nThis means I would get:\n- 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 70 = 140\n- 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 75 = 150\n- 0 units of item 3: 0 \u00d7 32 = 0\n- 0 units of item 4: 0 \u00d7 30 = 0\n- 4 units of item 5: 4 \u00d7 71 = 284\nTotal value = 574\n\nWith discount: 574 \u00d7 0.98 = 562.52, which is less than my outside offer of 644.\n\nActually, this isn't a good counteroffer for me. Since we're in round 2 and my outside offer (644) is quite high compared to any reasonable division, and Player 1's current offer provides much less value to me (334.18), I should walk away.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

                    "response": "I\u2019ll explain my thinking.\n\nMy goal is to \u201cclaim\u201d more of the items on which I have a comparative advantage while offering Player\u00a02 a bundle that is (in expectation) at least as good as what they might get by \u201cwalking away\u201d (their outside offer) or by waiting for later rounds (when discounting will reduce the total value available).\n\nI know my own per\u2010unit values:\n\u2003\u2022 Item\u00a01: 53\u2003(3 units)\n\u2003\u2022 Item\u00a02: 51\u2003(4 units)\n\u2003\u2022 Item\u00a03: 33\u2003(4 units)\n\u2003\u2022 Item\u00a04:\u20028\u2003(5 units)\n\u2003\u2022 Item\u00a05:\u20025\u2003(1 unit)\n\nThis sums to 540 for me. I also have an outside option of 197. I want a deal that gives me a higher payoff than 197 (and preferably much higher than 197) while \u201cleaving\u201d Player\u00a02 at least as well off as his (unknown) outside alternative. (Note that discounting has no effect in round\u00a01.)\n\nLooking at my numbers, I notice that items 1 and 2 are worth relatively high to me (159 and 204, respectively) so I would like to keep them. In contrast, items 3, 4, and 5 are \u201ccheaper\u201d for me and may be of higher relative value to Player\u00a02 (since their values are drawn uniformly on [1,101] with an average of about 51). Thus, a natural idea is to let Player\u00a02 have most or all of those items. (One might try to shave a unit from item\u00a03 to get more for me; however, since that unit is worth 33 to me but \u2013 if Player\u00a02\u2019s value is near the average of about 51 \u2013 would cost him roughly 51, a slight reduction in his share may well jeopardize his willingness to accept in an early round. In a three\u2010round negotiation with minimal discounting per round (gamma = 0.98), it is important to \u201cgive enough\u201d early on so that Player\u00a02 is unlikely to hold out.)\n\nAn offer that is both safe and attractive is to give Player\u00a02 all of items 3, 4, and 5. In numbers that would be:\n\u2003Offer to Player\u00a02: [0, 0, 4, 5, 1]\nwhich leaves me with:\n\u2003Item\u00a01: 3\u2003\u2192\u20033 \u00d7 53 = 159\n\u2003Item\u00a02: 4\u2003\u2192\u20034 \u00d7 51 = 204\n\u2003Item\u00a03: 0\u2003\u2192\u20030\n\u2003Item\u00a04: 0\u2003\u2192\u20030\n\u2003Item\u00a05: 0\u2003\u2192\u20030\nTotal for me = 159 + 204 = 363\n\nI\u2019d get 363 \u2013 well above my outside value of 197 \u2013 and Player\u00a02 would get an expected value (if his numbers are around the average 51) of:\n\u2003Item\u00a03: 4 \u00d7 51 = 204\n\u2003Item\u00a04: 5 \u00d7 51 = 255\n\u2003Item\u00a05: 1 \u00d7 51 = 51\nTotal \u2248 204 + 255 + 51 = 510\n\nHowever, I can try to do a bit better for myself if I \u201cclaim\u201d a little bit of an item that has a relatively low value to me (item\u00a03 is only 33 for me) even though it is likely to be somewhat more valuable for Player\u00a02. I must be cautious: if I keep too many units from item\u00a03, Player\u00a02\u2019s total may look too low compared to his outside option, and he might be inclined to wait or counter. Balancing these concerns, I choose a moderate proposal:\n\u2003Offer to Player\u00a02: [0, 0, 3, 5, 1]\n\nUnder this offer, the division is:\n\u2003For me:\n\u2003\u2003Item\u00a01: all 3\u2003\u2192\u2003159\n\u2003\u2003Item\u00a02: all 4\u2003\u2192\u2003204\n\u2003\u2003Item\u00a03: remaining 1\u2003\u2192\u200333\n\u2003\u2003Item\u00a04: 0\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2192\u20030\n\u2003\u2003Item\u00a05: 0\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2192\u20030\n\u2003\u2003Total = 159 + 204 + 33 = 396\n\u2003For Player\u00a02:\n\u2003\u2003Item\u00a03: 3\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2192\u2003(expected about 3 \u00d7 51 = 153)\n\u2003\u2003Item\u00a04: all 5\u2003\u2192\u2003(expected 5 \u00d7 51 = 255)\n\u2003\u2003Item\u00a05: all 1\u2003\u2192\u2003(expected about 51)\n\u2003\u2003Total \u2248 153 + 255 + 51 = 459\n\nThis gives me 396 while (by expectation) Player\u00a02 gets about 459. (Since his outside offer is privately drawn between 1 and his total potential \u2013 which on average is quite a bit higher \u2013 presenting him with an offer that in expectation is comfortably above what he might \u201cwalk away\u201d with should help secure immediate acceptance.)\n\nThus, in Round\u00a01, I will open with the offer:\n\u2003Give Player\u00a02: 0 of item\u00a01, 0 of item\u00a02, 3 of item\u00a03, 5 of item\u00a04, and 1 of item\u00a05.\n\nMy action is as follows:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 3, 5, 1]}",
