Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 435. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 435. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 588 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 3, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    2 x 0 + 78 x 2 + 85 x 3 + 9 x 0 + 22 x 1\n    which is 433 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 435. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

This means offers in later rounds are worth slightly less.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**  I need to construct an offer that gives Player 2 some items while ensuring I retain enough value to exceed my outside offer of 435. Given my high values for item 2 and item 3, I want to keep as much of those as possible.\n\n    Let's try an offer where I give Player 2: 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n\n    My remaining items would be: 1 unit of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n\n    The value of these remaining items to me is:\n    (1 * 2) + (3 * 78) + (2 * 85) + (2 * 9) + (2 * 22) = 2 + 234 + 170 + 18 + 44 = 468\n\n    Since 468 > 435, this offer is better than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\nSince there is no current offer, I will make a counteroffer as calculated above.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```",

This means that accepting an offer in round 2 gives me 0.98 times its actual value.

Let's calculate the value of keeping all the items for myself.\n\n    *   2 units of item 1: 2 * 2 = 4\n    *   4 units of item 2: 4 * 78 = 312\n    *   3 units of item 3: 3 * 85 = 255\n    *   3 units of item 4: 3 * 9 = 27\n    *   3 units of item 5: 3 * 22 = 66\n    *   Total value: 4 + 312 + 255 + 27 + 66 = 664\n\nI want an offer that gets me at least 435.

Let's try this:\n\n[2, 1, 1, 3, 3]\n\nThis means that I would have:\n0 units of item 1: 0 * 2 = 0\n3 units of item 2: 3 * 78 = 234\n2 units of item 3: 2 * 85 = 170\n0 units of item 4: 0 * 9 = 0\n0 units of item 5: 0 * 22 = 0\n\nTotal: 0 + 234 + 170 + 0 + 0 = 404. This is also too low.\n\nI need to give Player 2 less. I will try this:\n\n[2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nI keep\n0 units of item 1 = 0\n4 units of item 2 = 312\n3 units of item 3 = 255\n3 units of item 4 = 27\n3 units of item 5 = 66\n\nTotal = 660\n\nThis is better than my outside offer, and is a valid offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer is worth 222.46 to me, which is worse than my outside offer of 435.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 3, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    12 x 0 + 55 x 0 + 35 x 1 + 43 x 3 + 58 x 1\n    which is 222 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 223. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

I want to make an offer that is greater than my outside offer of 223.

You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value: 223\n   - My item values: item 1 = 12, item 2 = 55, item 3 = 35, item 4 = 43, item 5 = 58\n   - Total items: 0 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 6 of item 4, 4 of item 5\n   - Discount factor: 0.98. This means that an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 0.98^2 = 0.9604 of its face value. An offer accepted this round is worth 0.98 of its face value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** I am being offered [0, 1, 0, 3, 1]. This means I receive 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n     My value for this offer is (0 * 12) + (1 * 55) + (0 * 35) + (3 * 43) + (1 * 58) = 0 + 55 + 0 + 129 + 58 = 242.\n     Since this is round 2, the discounted value of accepting this offer is 242 * 0.98 = 237.16.\n   - **Comparison to outside offer:** The discounted value of the current offer (237.16) is greater than my outside offer (223). Therefore, accepting is better than walking away right now.\n\n3) **Consider counteroffers:**\n   - To avoid Mistake 1 (making an offer worse than my previous offer), I should only offer something that is better for me than Player 2's current offer.\n   - To avoid Mistake 2 (making an offer worse than my outside offer), any counteroffer I make must result in me receiving items worth more than 223.\n   - To avoid Mistake 4 (accepting an offer worse than my outside offer), I need to be sure what I get back is higher than my outside offer.\n\nLet's consider offering Player 2 half of the items, rounded where necessary. This gives Player 2:\n[0, 1, 1, 3, 2].\nIf I offer this, I would keep [0, 1, 1, 3, 2], which has a value of (0 * 12) + (1 * 55) + (1 * 35) + (3 * 43) + (2 * 58) = 0 + 55 + 35 + 129 + 116 = 335. Discounted, this becomes 335 * 0.98 = 328.3. This is much better than my outside offer.\n\nNow let's consider a counteroffer that is worse than the original offer to Player 2, but still potentially better than my outside offer.\nI will offer [0, 2, 2, 6, 4], giving away all of the items. This would give me a value of 0, which is awful! Let's consider a less extreme counteroffer.\nIf I offer Player 2 [0, 1, 1, 4, 2], then I keep [0, 1, 1, 2, 2]. This has a value of (0 * 12) + (1 * 55) + (1 * 35) + (2 * 43) + (2 * 58) = 0 + 55 + 35 + 86 + 116 = 292.\nIf I offer Player 2 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], then I keep [0, 2, 2, 6, 4]. This has a value of (0 * 12) + (2 * 55) + (2 * 35) + (6 * 43) + (4 * 58) = 0 + 110 + 70 + 258 + 232 = 670.\n\nSince accepting the current offer is better than my outside offer, and I don't believe I can get *much* better of an offer by making a counteroffer in round 2 considering the discount factor of 0.98 for round 2 and 0.9604 for round 3, I will accept the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 27. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 27. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 843 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    53 x 0 + 48 x 0 + 86 x 0 + 65 x 0 + 29 x 0\n    which is 0 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 27. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

This means that offers accepted in later rounds are worth slightly less. Since this is round 1, the discount factor doesn't play a significant role yet, but it will become more important in rounds 2 and 3.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**  We need to find a counteroffer that is likely to be accepted by Player 2 while still providing a value greater than 27 for Player 1.  A good starting point is to offer a relatively even split, leaning slightly in Player 1's favor, since Player 1 is making the first offer. Let's consider offering Player 2 half of the available items, rounding down when necessary:\n\n    *   Item 1: 3\n    *   Item 2: 2\n    *   Item 3: 4\n    *   Item 4: 1\n    *   Item 5: 3\n\n    This leaves Player 1 with:\n    *   Item 1: 3\n    *   Item 2: 2\n    *   Item 3: 4\n    *   Item 4: 2\n    *   Item 5: 3\n    The value of these items to Player 1 is:\n    3 * 53 + 2 * 48 + 4 * 86 + 2 * 65 + 3 * 29 = 159 + 96 + 344 + 130 + 87 = 816.

This means I would receive:\n    *   Item 1: 1 unit * 53 = 53\n    *   Item 2: 1 unit * 48 = 48\n    *   Item 3: 5 units * 86 = 430\n    *   Item 4: 2 units * 65 = 130\n    *   Item 5: 4 units * 29 = 116\n    *   Total value = 53 + 48 + 430 + 130 + 116 = 777\n    *   Since it is round 2, we multiply the total value by gamma^(r-1) = (0.98)^(2-1) = 0.98.  777 * 0.98 = 761.46\n*   This value (761.46) is significantly higher than my outside offer of 27.\n*   **Consider making a counteroffer:** To formulate a good counteroffer, I need to consider what Player 2 might accept and what is better than the current offer but worse for Player 2. I will aim for a value greater than 27, which is my outside option.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is very good (761.46 compared to my outside offer of 27).

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 247. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 247. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 651 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 1, 6, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 247\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 85, Item 2: 10, Item 3: 72, Item 4: 11, Item 5: 39\n*   **Total pool of items:** Item 1: 3, Item 2: 5, Item 3: 4, Item 4: 7, Item 5: 3\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.98. This means an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.98 times its face value to me, and an offer accepted in round 3 would be worth 0.98^2 times its face value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [0, 2, 1, 7, 0]. This means I keep [3, 3, 3, 0, 3].\n    *   Value of current offer to me: (3 * 85) + (3 * 10) + (3 * 72) + (0 * 11) + (3 * 39) = 255 + 30 + 216 + 0 + 117 = 618\n    *   Discounted value: 618 * 0.98 = 605.64. This is much greater than my outside offer of 247.\n*   **Round 1 Offer:** Player 1 offered [2, 3, 2, 4, 2]. This is the offer _I_ made to Player 2. \n*   **Round 1 Response:** Player 2 offered [0, 2, 1, 7, 0]. This is the current offer on the table.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider if I can make a better offer for myself, considering the risk of the negotiation breaking down and getting only my outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is worth 605.64 to me, which is significantly better than my outside offer of 247. Accepting it seems like a good option.\n*   Before I decide, let's calculate the value of my previous offer to me to ensure it's worse than the current offer (Mistake 1 avoidance). My previous offer was [2, 3, 2, 4, 2] to Player 2, which means I kept [1, 2, 2, 3, 1]. The value to me is (1 * 85) + (2 * 10) + (2 * 72) + (3 * 11) + (1 * 39) = 85 + 20 + 144 + 33 + 39 = 321. Discounted value: 321 * 0.98 = 314.58. This confirms my previous offer was significantly worse for me.\n\nSince the discounted value of the current offer (605.64) is much greater than my outside option (247) and I have avoided Mistake 1, I should accept this offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 281. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 281. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 447 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 6, 4, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    63 x 0 + 26 x 1 + 8 x 6 + 50 x 4 + 2 x 3\n    which is 280 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 281. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 281.\n   - My item values are: item 1 = 63, item 2 = 26, item 3 = 8, item 4 = 50, item 5 = 2.\n   - The total pool of items is: 6 units of item 1, 7 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor is 0.98. Since it's the first round, the discount factor doesn't yet play a role because it's 0.98^(1-1) = 1.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - There is no current offer on the table.\n   - I need to consider potential counteroffers. My goal is to make an offer that is good enough that player 2 will accept it, while also ensuring I receive at least my outside offer value (281).\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - I will propose a counteroffer. To construct a valid offer, I need to consider the total units available for each item and what I'd like to keep for myself to exceed my outside offer. Let's start by trying to keep roughly half of the total value and see where that takes us.\n\nLet's start with an offer where I give Player 2 a decent amount of the less valuable items (3 and 5) and less of the more valuable ones (1, 2, and 4).\n\nI'll start by keeping 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5. That means offering Player 2 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n\nMy value for this would be:\n3 * 63 + 3 * 26 + 3 * 8 + 2 * 50 + 3 * 2 = 189 + 78 + 24 + 100 + 6 = 397\n\nThis is significantly above my outside offer. I can afford to give more to Player 2. Let's try offering Player 2 more of item 1.\n\nLet's propose offering Player 2 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n\nThat means I would keep 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n\nMy value for this would be:\n2 * 63 + 3 * 26 + 3 * 8 + 2 * 50 + 3 * 2 = 126 + 78 + 24 + 100 + 6 = 334\n\nThis is still above my outside offer. Let's offer 5 units of item 1, 5 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 3 of item 5:\n\nMy value for this would be:\n1 * 63 + 2 * 26 + 3 * 8 + 2 * 50 + 3 * 2 = 63 + 52 + 24 + 100 + 6 = 245. This is less than 281.\n\nSo, based on the calculations, the offer of [4, 4, 3, 2, 3] is above my outside offer. Let's stick with that.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 4, 3, 2, 3]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 6, 4, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    63 x 0 + 26 x 1 + 8 x 6 + 50 x 4 + 2 x 3\n    which is 280 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 281. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Since this is round 1, the discount factor doesn't directly affect my decision yet, but it will in future rounds if the negotiation continues.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer: There is no current offer.\n   - Potential counteroffers: I need to calculate the value of different divisions and compare them to my outside offer.\n\n3) **Initial Counteroffer Strategy:**\n\nI want to make a counteroffer that is likely to be accepted but also gives me a good value. I'll start by trying to give Player 2 a little more than half of the total value. I need to keep more valuable items and give away less valuable ones. I'll make an initial counteroffer to Player 2, and then revise it by calculating the value for myself and comparing it to the outside offer.\n\nLet's start with an offer of [2, 1, 2, 1, 2] to Player 2, meaning I keep [2, 2, 2, 2, 3].\n\nMy value = (2 * 75) + (2 * 81) + (2 * 39) + (2 * 20) + (3 * 8) = 150 + 162 + 78 + 40 + 24 = 454. This is less than my outside offer of 525, so I'm not going to offer them this division.\n\nLet's start with an offer of [1, 0, 1, 0, 1] to Player 2, meaning I keep [3, 3, 3, 3, 4].\nMy value = (3 * 75) + (3 * 81) + (3 * 39) + (3 * 20) + (4 * 8) = 225 + 243 + 117 + 60 + 32 = 677. This is better than the outside offer of 525.\n\nThis seems like a reasonable starting point. Now I will make the counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 2, 4, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    75 x 2 + 81 x 2 + 39 x 4 + 20 x 2 + 8 x 2\n    which is 524 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 525. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 3, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 3, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

This means that accepting an offer in round 2 gives me 0.98 times its value and accepting in round 3 gives me 0.98^2 times its value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer:** I am being offered [1, 1, 3, 1, 1].

The offer [0, 0, 1, 0, 0] will result in 760 if the other agent accepts.\n\nI will propose the offer [0, 0, 1, 0, 0] since this will likely lead to a higher outcome if I were to be able to get this to be accepted.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 525. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 669 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 2, 4, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    75 x 2 + 81 x 2 + 39 x 4 + 20 x 2 + 8 x 2\n    which is 524 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 525. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 3, 1, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 3, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 3, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action.\n\n1. **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 525.\n   - My item values are: item 1 = 75, item 2 = 81, item 3 = 39, item 4 = 20, item 5 = 8.\n   - Total items: 4 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 3 of item 4, 5 of item 5.\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.98. Since we are in round 3, the discount factor will be 0.98^(3-1) = 0.98^2 = 0.9604.\n\n2. **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer: I receive [1, 1, 3, 1, 1]. This means Player 2 is offering me 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5. My value for this offer is:\n     (1 * 75) + (1 * 81) + (3 * 39) + (1 * 20) + (1 * 8) = 75 + 81 + 117 + 20 + 8 = 301\n   - Discounted value of current offer: 301 * 0.9604 = 289.0804\n   - Since the discounted value of the current offer (289.0804) is less than my outside offer (525), accepting it would be a mistake.\n\n   - Let's consider walking away. This would give me my outside offer value of 525.\n\n   - Now, let's consider a counteroffer. Since this is the last round, any counteroffer from Player 2 is equivalent to a walk for them. I want to maximize my value in this final round.\n   To be better than walking away, I need to make sure my value is greater than 525 * 0.9604 = 504.21\n\nLet's see what I get if I take all items.\n(4 * 75) + (3 * 81) + (4 * 39) + (3 * 20) + (5 * 8) = 300 + 243 + 156 + 60 + 40 = 799\nSo, if I take all the items (offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] to Player 2), I have value 799, and the discounted value for this is 799 * 0.9604 = 767.3596, which is greater than the discounted outside offer.\n\nHowever, I suspect I need to give Player 2 *something* to get them to agree. Let's try giving the minimum possible to Player 2. Suppose I give Player 2 only 1 unit of item 5:\nMy Items: [4, 3, 4, 3, 4]\nPlayer 2 Items: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n\nMy Value = (4 * 75) + (3 * 81) + (4 * 39) + (3 * 20) + (4 * 8) = 300 + 243 + 156 + 60 + 32 = 791\n791 * 0.9604 = 759.6764\n\nLet's try giving Player 2 items they value least. My value is 8 for item 5, 20 for item 4, 39 for item 3, 75 for item 1, 81 for item 2. So, giving up item 5 is best for me. Giving up item 4 is the next best for me.\n\nLet's try giving [0, 0, 0, 1, 0].\nMy items: [4, 3, 4, 2, 5]\nMy value: (4 * 75) + (3 * 81) + (4 * 39) + (2 * 20) + (5 * 8) = 300 + 243 + 156 + 40 + 40 = 779\n779 * 0.9604 = 748.1516\n\nIf I give [0, 0, 1, 0, 0], my value is 799 - 39 = 760. 760 * 0.9604 = 730. So giving up item 3 is a bit expensive.\n\nLet's try giving the initial offer from Player 2 in Round 1: [1, 1, 3, 1, 1]\nI keep [3, 2, 1, 2, 4]\nMy Value = (3*75) + (2*81) + (1*39) + (2*20) + (4*8) = 225 + 162 + 39 + 40 + 32 = 498\n\nOkay, clearly I need to do better than the above. It appears that the minimum I must have for the round is 504.21.\nIt's the last round and Player 2's offer is less than my outside offer. So I should make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

This requires estimating how much Player 2 values the items. Without knowing Player 2's values, I need to be strategic. A reasonable starting point is to offer Player 2 a \"fair\" share, then adjust based on the negotiation.\n\n3) **Making a Decision:**\n\nI will start by offering a division that seems relatively fair, and ensures I keep items worth at least my outside offer. Given my values, I should try to keep as much of item 5 as possible.\n\nLet's consider the following offer to Player 2: 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 0, 2, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    9 x 0 + 24 x 3 + 4 x 0 + 7 x 2 + 42 x 0\n    which is 86 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 87. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 1, 2, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 3, 0, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 3, 0, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

My value would have been (2 * 9) + (1 * 24) + (2 * 4) + (3 * 7) + (2 * 42) = 18 + 24 + 8 + 21 + 84 = 155\n        *   Discounted value: 155 * (0.98)^(1-1) = 155\n\n3.  **Counteroffer considerations:**\n\n    Let's consider a counteroffer. To avoid mistake 2 (offering something worse than my outside offer), I need to keep at least a value of 87.\n\n    I need to consider what the other player would likely accept. I was offered [3, 3, 0, 1, 0] in round 1. Player 1 offered [2, 2, 1, 2, 1].\n\n    Let's start with a reasonable counteroffer. Suppose I offer [2, 2, 0, 1, 0] to the other player. Then I would keep:\n        *   Item 1: 5 - 2 = 3\n        *   Item 2: 4 - 2 = 2\n        *   Item 3: 2 - 0 = 2\n        *   Item 4: 4 - 1 = 3\n        *   Item 5: 2 - 0 = 2\n    \n    My value: (3 * 9) + (2 * 24) + (2 * 4) + (3 * 7) + (2 * 42) = 27 + 48 + 8 + 21 + 84 = 188\n    Discounted value: 188 * 0.98 = 184.24\n\n    This is significantly higher than my outside offer.\n\n    However, since the current offer is worth 151.9 > 87 and it's only round 2, it would be wise to try and increase my potential payoff by making a counteroffer.\n\n4.  **Decision:**\n\nThe current offer is worth 151.9. A plausible counteroffer of [2, 2, 0, 1, 0] gives me a value of 184.24 *if* it's accepted. There is a risk that the offer might be rejected.\n\nTherefore, I'll make the counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 0, 1, 0]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 1, 5, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    88 x 0 + 95 x 3 + 79 x 1 + 41 x 5 + 45 x 1\n    which is 614 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 615. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

This means that getting a deal done sooner is slightly better than later. We want to avoid walking away from deals that, once discounted, are still better than our outside offer.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer. We are starting the negotiation.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Let's explore some possible counteroffers and calculate their value to me:\n    *   **Counteroffer 1: Even split (approximately):** Offer half of each item to Player 2. Since we can only offer whole units, let's round fairly. [1, 3, 0, 2, 3]\n\n        *   I keep: [2, 3, 1, 3, 4]\n        *   Value: (2 * 88) + (3 * 95) + (1 * 79) + (3 * 41) + (4 * 45) = 176 + 285 + 79 + 123 + 180 = 843\n\n        * 843 is greater than 615, so it is a potential offer.\n\n    *   **Counteroffer 2: Offer less to Player 2:** Offer less than an even split, to start off aggressively, to try to extract more from player 2. [0, 2, 0, 1, 2]\n\n        *   I keep: [3, 4, 1, 4, 5]\n        *   Value: (3 * 88) + (4 * 95) + (1 * 79) + (4 * 41) + (5 * 45) = 264 + 380 + 79 + 164 + 225 = 1112\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Since there is no current offer, I need to make an initial offer.\n*   Counteroffer 1 has a value to me of 843, which is significantly greater than my outside offer of 615.\n*   Counteroffer 2 has a value of 1112, so it is even better for me.\n*   I will start with Counteroffer 1, which is more moderate, as it's important to begin with a feasible offer in order to have better bargaining power.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 3, 0, 2, 3]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 615. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1044 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 1, 5, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    88 x 0 + 95 x 3 + 79 x 1 + 41 x 5 + 45 x 1\n    which is 614 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 615. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 0, 2, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 2, 0, 4, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 0, 2, 3]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [0, 2, 0, 4, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 0, 4, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 615.\n   - My values for the items are: item 1 = 88, item 2 = 95, item 3 = 79, item 4 = 41, item 5 = 45.\n   - The total pool of items is: 3 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 7 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor is 0.98. Since this is round 3, the discount factor's impact is (0.98)^(3-1) = 0.98^2 = 0.9604. This means any deal we make now is worth slightly less than a deal we could have made in round 1.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - The current offer is [0, 2, 0, 4, 3]. This means Player 2 is offering me 0 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n   - If I accept this offer, I get:\n     - 0 * 88 + 2 * 95 + 0 * 79 + 4 * 41 + 3 * 45 = 0 + 190 + 0 + 164 + 135 = 489\n   - Since this is round 3, we need to discount this value: 489 * 0.9604 = 469.64.\n   - My outside offer is 615, which is greater than the discounted value of accepting the current offer (469.64). Therefore, accepting this offer is worse than walking away.\n\n   - Now, let's consider some potential counteroffers. I need to keep enough items to get a value greater than 615. I have the full item pool [3, 6, 1, 5, 7] giving me a total value of 1433.\n   - Let's try to make an offer that gives me a value close to, but above, 615. I need to give away items to get closer to my outside offer.\n\n   - Consider offering Player 2 [1, 4, 1, 3, 4]. That would leave me with [2, 2, 0, 2, 3]. The value for me is:\n     - 2 * 88 + 2 * 95 + 0 * 79 + 2 * 41 + 3 * 45 = 176 + 190 + 0 + 82 + 135 = 583\n     - Discounted value = 583 * 0.9604 = 559.91. Still less than my outside offer.\n\n   - Consider offering Player 2 [0, 3, 0, 2, 3]. That would leave me with [3, 3, 1, 3, 4]. The value for me is:\n     - 3 * 88 + 3 * 95 + 1 * 79 + 3 * 41 + 4 * 45 = 264 + 285 + 79 + 123 + 180 = 931\n     - Discounted value = 931 * 0.9604 = 894.13. This is much better than my outside offer.\n\n   - Now, consider offering Player 2 [1, 2, 0, 1, 2]. That would leave me with [2, 4, 1, 4, 5]. The value for me is:\n     - 2 * 88 + 4 * 95 + 1 * 79 + 4 * 41 + 5 * 45 = 176 + 380 + 79 + 164 + 225 = 1024\n     - Discounted value = 1024 * 0.9604 = 983.456. This is still much better than my outside offer. Let's try to make it worse.\n\n   - How about offering Player 2 [0, 4, 0, 3, 4]? This leaves me [3, 2, 1, 2, 3]\n   - 3 * 88 + 2 * 95 + 1 * 79 + 2 * 41 + 3 * 45 = 264 + 190 + 79 + 82 + 135 = 750\n   - Discounted Value = 750 * .9604 = 720.3\n   - This offer of [0, 4, 0, 3, 4] seems promising.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is unacceptable. I will propose the offer [0, 4, 0, 3, 4].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 4, 0, 3, 4]}\n```",

This means that accepting an offer in a later round is slightly less valuable than accepting it now.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer: None.\n   - Potential counteroffers: Need to explore.\n\n3) Make a decision: Since there is no current offer, I must make an initial offer. I need to offer Player 2 some items such that the value of the items I keep is greater than my outside offer. I should avoid offering all or no items, and avoid making an offer worse than my outside offer.\n\nLet's start by calculating the total value of all items to me:\n(5 * 86) + (4 * 34) + (3 * 86) + (4 * 100) + (6 * 63) = 430 + 136 + 258 + 400 + 378 = 1602\n\nTo ensure my offer is better than my outside offer of 1183, I want to keep items worth at least 1183. I want to offer Player 2 an amount that isn't zero for each of the item types.\n\nLet's try offering Player 2 1 unit of each item type: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. This would mean I keep [4, 3, 2, 3, 5].\nMy value would be: (4 * 86) + (3 * 34) + (2 * 86) + (3 * 100) + (5 * 63) = 344 + 102 + 172 + 300 + 315 = 1233\nThis is greater than my outside offer value of 1183.\n\nNow let's try a different offer where I offer Player 2 more of some items, to see if I can get away with a slightly lower personal value. How about offer [2, 2, 1, 2, 2]?\nMy value would be: (3 * 86) + (2 * 34) + (2 * 86) + (2 * 100) + (4 * 63) = 258 + 68 + 172 + 200 + 252 = 956. This is less than my outside offer, so it's no good.\n\nSo, let's go with the offer [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], since I know that this offer leaves me with a value that is better than my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 3, 3, 1, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    86 x 4 + 34 x 3 + 86 x 3 + 100 x 1 + 63 x 6\n    which is 1182 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1183. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 1, 1, 1, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 1, 1, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 276. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 726 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 2, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    39 x 0 + 56 x 0 + 43 x 1 + 96 x 2 + 8 x 5\n    which is 275 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 276. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

We are at the start of the negotiation.\n\nLet's consider some potential counteroffers. A reasonable starting point is to offer a split where each player gets roughly half the value.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value is 276.\n*   My item values are: item 1 = 39, item 2 = 56, item 3 = 43, item 4 = 96, item 5 = 8.\n*   Total item quantities are: item 1 = 3, item 2 = 2, item 3 = 7, item 4 = 8, item 5 = 5.\n*   The discount factor is 0.98. This means that an offer accepted in a later round is worth slightly less than an offer accepted now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [0, 0, 7, 0, 3]. This means I would receive 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5. The total value to me would be: (0 * 39) + (0 * 56) + (7 * 43) + (0 * 96) + (3 * 8) = 0 + 0 + 301 + 0 + 24 = 325.\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer's value (325) is greater than my outside offer value (276).\n\n3) **Consider Round 1 offers:**\n\n*   Player 1's (my) Round 1 offer was [1, 1, 3, 4, 2]. This meant I would keep 2 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 4 of item 4 and 3 of item 5. My value from this is (2 * 39) + (1 * 56) + (4 * 43) + (4 * 96) + (3 * 8) = 78 + 56 + 172 + 384 + 24 = 714.\n*   Player 2's Round 1 offer to me was [0, 0, 7, 0, 3].  This is identical to the current offer.\n\n4) **Consider a counteroffer:** Since the current offer is better than my outside offer, I should consider accepting it. However, since it is round 2, I might be able to get a better deal by making a counteroffer. Let's explore potential counteroffers, ensuring they are above 276:\n\n*   **Counteroffer 1: Giving Player 2 almost everything except the most valuable items for me.** Offer: [0, 1, 7, 8, 5]. This gives me 3 of item 1, and 1 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 0 of item 4 and 0 of item 5. Value: (3 * 39) + (1 * 56) + (0 * 43) + (0 * 96) + (0 * 8) = 117 + 56 = 173. This is below 276, so not a good counteroffer!\n*   **Counteroffer 2: Aim for a more balanced split, skewed in my favor.** Offer: [1, 1, 4, 4, 3]. Then, I get: 2 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 4 of item 4, 2 of item 5. My value: (2 * 39) + (1 * 56) + (3 * 43) + (4 * 96) + (2 * 8) = 78 + 56 + 129 + 384 + 16 = 663.\n\n5) **Decision:**\n\nThe current offer of [0, 0, 7, 0, 3] gives me a value of 325, which is greater than my outside option of 276. I am in round 2, so I can try a counteroffer.\nCounteroffer 2 above is a reasonable outcome, but it may be rejected. Given that I only have one round remaining, I should accept the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 632. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 632. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 837 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 1, 3, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    74 x 0 + 70 x 3 + 15 x 1 + 74 x 3 + 46 x 4\n    which is 631 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 632. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

This means that offers in later rounds are slightly less valuable.\n\n2) **Assessing Offers:**\n   - Current offer: None.\n   - Potential counteroffers: I need to figure out what to offer Player 2. The key is to offer Player 2 enough to make them accept while still ensuring I get a value greater than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n   - Since there's no current offer, I need to make an initial offer.\n\nNow, let's think about a good starting offer. I need to find a balance between offering enough to entice Player 2 and keeping enough for myself to exceed my outside offer. I will start by offering a little over half of each item.\n\nLet's consider offering Player 2 the following: [3, 2, 3, 2, 2]\n\nMy remaining items would then be: [2, 2, 2, 1, 2]\n\nMy value from this would be: (2 * 74) + (2 * 70) + (2 * 15) + (1 * 74) + (2 * 46) = 148 + 140 + 30 + 74 + 92 = 484\n\nThis is less than my outside offer of 632, so it is not a good start.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 442. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 639 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 3, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    2 x 0 + 10 x 2 + 93 x 3 + 37 x 0 + 71 x 2\n    which is 441 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 442. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

Since this is round 1, the discount factor doesn't immediately impact the decision, but it will influence future rounds if a deal isn't reached.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer: None. This means I need to make the first offer.\n   - Potential counteroffers:  I need to figure out a division that gives me a value greater than 442.\n\n3) **Consider possible strategies and counteroffers**:\n\nHere are a few counteroffer strategies I will evaluate:\n\n* **Strategy 1: Offer Player 2 a 'fair' split, focusing on items I value less and they might value more.** I value item 3 the most, and item 1 and 2 the least.\n\n   * Offer: [1, 4, 0, 1, 0] (This gives Player 2 all of item 1 and item 4, half of item 2, none of item 3, and none of item 5)\n   * My remaining: [0, 4, 3, 0, 4]\n   * My value: (0 * 2) + (4 * 10) + (3 * 93) + (0 * 37) + (4 * 71) = 0 + 40 + 279 + 0 + 284 = 603\n   * This is greater than 442.\n\n* **Strategy 2: Be slightly more generous to potentially secure a quicker deal, but still ensuring I surpass my outside offer.**\n\n    * Offer: [1, 5, 0, 1, 1]\n    * My remaining: [0, 3, 3, 0, 3]\n    * My value: (0 * 2) + (3 * 10) + (3 * 93) + (0 * 37) + (3 * 71) = 0 + 30 + 279 + 0 + 213 = 522\n    * This is also greater than 442.\n\n* **Strategy 3: Offer close to equal value, but still retaining the edge for me, and focusing on my value for item 3.**\n\n    * Total value available is (1 * 2) + (8 * 10) + (3 * 93) + (1 * 37) + (4 * 71) = 2 + 80 + 279 + 37 + 284 = 682\n    * Half of the total value would be 341 for each player, but I need to exceed my 442 value. Let's aim for approximately 60% for me.\n\nGiven that this is the first round, I will make a relatively generous offer (Strategy 2) to test the waters and see Player 2's reaction. This leaves me with a comfortable margin above my outside offer and allows room for negotiation in subsequent rounds.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 5, 0, 1, 1]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 442. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 639 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 3, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    2 x 0 + 10 x 2 + 93 x 3 + 37 x 0 + 71 x 2\n    which is 441 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 442. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 5, 0, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 2, 2, 0, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 2, 0, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 442\n*   My item values: item 1 = 2, item 2 = 10, item 3 = 93, item 4 = 37, item 5 = 71\n*   Total item pool: 1 of item 1, 8 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 1 of item 4, 4 of item 5\n*   Discount factor: 0.98\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [1, 2, 2, 0, 2]. This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 1 - 1 = 0\n    *   Item 2: 8 - 2 = 6\n    *   Item 3: 3 - 2 = 1\n    *   Item 4: 1 - 0 = 1\n    *   Item 5: 4 - 2 = 2\n    My value for this offer is: (0 * 2) + (6 * 10) + (1 * 93) + (1 * 37) + (2 * 71) = 0 + 60 + 93 + 37 + 142 = 332.\n\n    Since it is round 2, the value will be discounted by 0.98^(2-1)=0.98. Therefore the offer's value is 332 * 0.98 = 325.36. This is less than my outside offer.\n\n*   **Counteroffer Considerations:** I need to construct an offer that results in a value greater than 442, considering the discount factor of 0.98. So I want an offer that gives me an undiscounted value of 442/0.98 = 451.02 or higher.\n\n    Let's consider keeping all of items 3 and 5. This would yield 3 * 93 + 4 * 71 = 279 + 284 = 563. This is far greater than my outside offer. So I can give up some of these items.\n\n    Let's consider offering all of Item 1, Item 2, and Item 4, while keeping all of Items 3 and 5. The offer would be [1, 8, 0, 1, 0], so I keep [0, 0, 3, 0, 4]. The resulting value for me would be 3*93+4*71 = 279+284 = 563. The discounted value is 563*0.98 = 551.74, greater than my outside offer of 442.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer is much worse than my outside offer. I can propose a counteroffer [1, 8, 0, 1, 0] and ensure it is better than my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 8, 0, 1, 0]}\n```",

This means that an offer accepted in a later round is worth slightly less than the same offer accepted now.\n\n2. **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - Current offer: None.  Since there's no offer on the table, I need to consider what to offer Player 2.

I want to make an offer that gives enough to Player 2 to make them consider accepting, but also leaves me with at least 1135.\n\n     Let's try giving away approximately half of each item and see if that offer gets me above my outside offer if I keep the rest. I will propose giving the following to Player 2: [1, 1, 2, 2, 4]. This means I keep [2, 2, 2, 2, 4].\n     Value to me if I keep [2, 2, 2, 2, 4]:\n     (2 * 86) + (2 * 95) + (2 * 69) + (2 * 100) + (4 * 12) = 172 + 190 + 138 + 200 + 48 = 748\n     This is clearly far below my outside offer, so that will not work.\n\n     Let's consider a scenario where I give away much less, such as [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].

That means that I keep [3, 3, 4, 4, 7].\n     Value to me if I keep [3, 3, 4, 4, 7]:\n     (3 * 86) + (3 * 95) + (4 * 69) + (4 * 100) + (7 * 12) = 258 + 285 + 276 + 400 + 84 = 1303\n\n     That is still below my outside offer.\n     Let's try giving away nothing, [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. That means that I keep [3, 3, 4, 4, 8].\n     Value to me if I keep [3, 3, 4, 4, 8]:\n     (3 * 86) + (3 * 95) + (4 * 69) + (4 * 100) + (8 * 12) = 258 + 285 + 276 + 400 + 96 = 1315\n\n3. **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n    Since this is round 1 and I want to achieve a deal better than my outside offer as quickly as possible.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 2, 4, 4, 8] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    86 x 2 + 95 x 2 + 69 x 4 + 100 x 4 + 12 x 8\n    which is 1134 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1135. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 3, 0, 1, 7]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 3, 0, 1, 7]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step to determine the optimal action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 1135\n*   My item values: item 1: 86, item 2: 95, item 3: 69, item 4: 100, item 5: 12\n*   Total items: item 1: 3, item 2: 3, item 3: 4, item 4: 4, item 5: 8\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.98. This means an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.98 times its face value. An offer accepted in round 3 is worth 0.98^2 times its face value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [0, 3, 0, 1, 7].  This means I would get:\n    *   0 units of item 1\n    *   3 units of item 2\n    *   0 units of item 3\n    *   1 units of item 4\n    *   7 units of item 5\n    My value for this offer is: (0 * 86) + (3 * 95) + (0 * 69) + (1 * 100) + (7 * 12) = 0 + 285 + 0 + 100 + 84 = 469.\n    Since this is round 2, the discounted value is 469 * 0.98 = 459.62. This is significantly less than my outside offer of 1135.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 1135 (or close to it, considering the discount factor). Player 2 offered [0, 3, 0, 1, 7] which means they are keeping [3, 0, 4, 3, 1].\n    Let's calculate the maximum possible value I can get, which is keeping all items:\n    (3 * 86) + (3 * 95) + (4 * 69) + (4 * 100) + (8 * 12) = 258 + 285 + 276 + 400 + 96 = 1315\n    This is already greater than my outside offer. In round 2, I need 1135/0.98 = 1158.16 to beat my outside offer.\n    Let's try to give away minimum number of items such that I have the highest values items with me.\n    Let's try giving away [0,0,0,0,0] and keeping all the items with me:\n    (3 * 86) + (3 * 95) + (4 * 69) + (4 * 100) + (8 * 12) = 258 + 285 + 276 + 400 + 96 = 1315.\n    The discounted value in round 2 is 1315 * 0.98 = 1288.7. This is larger than my outside offer of 1135.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is not acceptable as it's far below my outside offer.\n*   Giving away no items results in a value greater than my outside offer, taking into account the discount factor.\n*   I'll propose a counteroffer of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step to determine the optimal action in this final round.\n\n1. **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value: 1135\n   - My item values: item 1 = 86, item 2 = 95, item 3 = 69, item 4 = 100, item 5 = 12\n   - Total items: 3 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 4 of item 4, 8 of item 5\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.98. Since this is the final round (round 3), any accepted offer will be multiplied by 0.98^(3-1) = 0.98^2 = 0.9604\n\n2. **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer: [0, 3, 0, 1, 7]. This means I receive 0 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 7 of item 5.\n      - My value if I accept: (0 * 86) + (3 * 95) + (0 * 69) + (1 * 100) + (7 * 12) = 0 + 285 + 0 + 100 + 84 = 469\n      - Discounted value if I accept: 469 * 0.9604 = 450.4276\n   - Potential counteroffers: Since this is the last round, any counteroffer from me is essentially a WALK if Player 2 responds with a counteroffer. If Player 2 were to accept, however, it must be a better deal than my outside option. Thus, I must consider other offers in relation to my outside option.\n\n3. **Decision:**\n\n   - Accepting the current offer yields a discounted value of 450.4276.\n   - Walking away yields a value of 1135.\n   - Since 450.4276 < 1135, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n   - Given that this is the last round, making a counteroffer is equivalent to walking away since a counteroffer from Player 2 is considered a walk.\n\nTherefore, the best course of action is to walk away and take my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 244. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 522 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 1, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party.

You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Current Situation Analysis:**\n\n*   **Outside Offer Value:** 244\n*   **Item Values:** Item 1: 68, Item 2: 39, Item 3: 2, Item 4: 11, Item 5: 54\n*   **Total Items:** Item 1: 3, Item 2: 6, Item 3: 2, Item 4: 2, Item 5: 5\n*   **Discount Factor:** gamma = 0.98.  This means accepting an offer in round 2 is worth 0.98 times its actual value to me, and in round 3 it will be 0.98^2 times its actual value.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** I am offered [0, 3, 0, 0, 4]. This means I get 0 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5.\n    *   Value of current offer = (0 * 68) + (3 * 39) + (0 * 2) + (0 * 11) + (4 * 54) = 0 + 117 + 0 + 0 + 216 = 333\n    *   Discounted value in round 2 = 333 * 0.98 = 326.34\n*   **Comparison to Outside Offer:** The discounted value of the current offer (326.34) is greater than my outside offer (244). Therefore, accepting the current offer is better than walking away *at this moment*.\n*   **Consider previous offer:** In the previous round, Player 1 offered [0, 5, 2, 2, 0]. That means I would have received [3, 1, 0, 0, 5]. My value would have been: \n     (3 * 68) + (1 * 39) + (0 * 2) + (0 * 11) + (5 * 54) = 204 + 39 + 0 + 0 + 270 = 513. This means Player 2's counteroffer was extremely bad for me, they offered me basically nothing of value.\n\n3) **Explore potential counteroffers:** Now, let's consider a possible counteroffer. I want to maximize my value while ensuring Player 2 also gets something acceptable, aiming for a split that's better than my outside offer, considering the discount factor. Let's try to claim more of the items I value highly (items 1 and 5), while conceding more of item 2. I'll start by proposing an offer where I keep almost all of items 1 and 5, some of item 2, and little of 3 and 4. \n\nLet's try offering Player 2 [0, 5, 2, 2, 0] again, as this was player 1's original offer. \nMy value from this would be (3 * 68) + (1 * 39) + (0 * 2) + (0 * 11) + (5 * 54) = 204 + 39 + 270 = 513.\nThe discounted value to me is 513 * 0.98 = 502.74, which is still much better than my outside offer.\n\nNow consider offering [0, 4, 1, 1, 0]. In this case, I would get [3, 2, 1, 1, 5].\nMy value would be (3 * 68) + (2 * 39) + (1 * 2) + (1 * 11) + (5 * 54) = 204 + 78 + 2 + 11 + 270 = 565.\nDiscounted value = 565 * 0.98 = 553.7.\n\nLet's try something closer to my outside option. Suppose I offered the opponent [1, 5, 1, 1, 2]. Then I would receive [2, 1, 1, 1, 3].\nMy value would be (2 * 68) + (1 * 39) + (1 * 2) + (1 * 11) + (3 * 54) = 136 + 39 + 2 + 11 + 162 = 350.\nDiscounted value = 350 * 0.98 = 343.\n\n**Decision:**\nThe current offer of [0, 3, 0, 0, 4] has a discounted value of 326.34, and my outside option is 244. I can try to make a counteroffer to get closer to the optimal solution.\n\nI will propose [0, 4, 1, 1, 0]\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 4, 1, 1, 0]}\n```",

This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

Your value would be:\n    48 x 0 + 99 x 2 + 99 x 2 + 49 x 0 + 22 x 0\n    which is 396 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 405. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** 405\n*   **Item values:** Item 1 = 48, Item 2 = 99, Item 3 = 99, Item 4 = 49, Item 5 = 22\n*   **Total items:** Item 1 = 8, Item 2 = 4, Item 3 = 2, Item 4 = 7, Item 5 = 1\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.98. This means that getting a deal in later rounds is slightly less valuable than getting a deal now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** We need to explore potential divisions of items. Since this is round 1, we want to propose an offer that is likely to be accepted by Player 2. We must also ensure our remaining items after the offer is worth more than our outside offer.\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** Any offer we accept should give us a value greater than or equal to 405.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince this is the first round, making a reasonable offer is better than walking away. We want to find an offer that is likely to be accepted by Player 2 and that gives us a value greater than 405. Let's start with an equal split, but adjust to account for the differing numbers of items and our preferences. First let's look at the maximum theoretical value we can achieve if we get all the items:\n8 * 48 + 4 * 99 + 2 * 99 + 7 * 49 + 1 * 22 = 384 + 396 + 198 + 343 + 22 = 1343\n\nLet's try giving Player 2 half the items, rounding as necessary, or giving them a bit more, as we want to be sure to get a deal. Let's give player 2:\nItem 1: 4\nItem 2: 2\nItem 3: 1\nItem 4: 3\nItem 5: 0\n\nThis results in Player 1 keeping:\nItem 1: 4\nItem 2: 2\nItem 3: 1\nItem 4: 4\nItem 5: 1\n\nValue to Player 1:\n4 * 48 + 2 * 99 + 1 * 99 + 4 * 49 + 1 * 22 = 192 + 198 + 99 + 196 + 22 = 707\n\nThis is greater than our outside offer.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 2, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    48 x 0 + 99 x 2 + 99 x 2 + 49 x 0 + 22 x 0\n    which is 396 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 405. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "I need to evaluate the current offer and decide whether to accept, walk away, or make a counteroffer.\n\nStep 1: Calculate my value for the current offer from Player 1.\nCurrent offer gives me:\n- 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 38 = 76\n- 0 units of item 2: 0 \u00d7 55 = 0\n- 0 units of item 3: 0 \u00d7 8 = 0\n- 6 units of item 4: 6 \u00d7 5 = 30\n- 0 units of item 5: 0 \u00d7 71 = 0\nTotal value = 106\n\nStep 2: Apply the discount factor for round 2.\nDiscounted value = 106 \u00d7 (0.98)^(2-1) = 106 \u00d7 0.98 = 103.88\n\nStep 3: Compare with my outside offer.\nMy outside offer is 567, which is much higher than the value of the current offer (103.88).\n\nStep 4: Consider making a counteroffer.\nBased on my values, I should prioritize:\n- Item 5 (71 per unit, 1 total)\n- Item 2 (55 per unit, 4 total)\n- Item 1 (38 per unit, 8 total)\n- Item 3 (8 per unit, 2 total)\n- Item 4 (5 per unit, 7 total)\n\nSince we're in round 2 of 3, I need to make a reasonable offer that might be accepted. My previous offer was quite aggressive. I'll keep most high-value items for myself but give more of the low-value items.\n\nI'll propose:\n- Give Player 1: 3 of item 1 (keeping 5 for myself)\n- Give Player 1: 1 of item 2 (keeping 3 for myself)\n- Give Player 1: 2 of item 3 (keeping 0 for myself)\n- Give Player 1: 7 of item 4 (keeping 0 for myself)\n- Give Player 1: 0 of item 5 (keeping 1 for myself)\n\nMy value from this offer: (5\u00d738) + (3\u00d755) + (0\u00d78) + (0\u00d75) + (1\u00d771) = 190 + 165 + 0 + 0 + 71 = 426\nDiscounted value: 426 \u00d7 0.98\u00b2 = 426 \u00d7 0.9604 = 409.13 (for round 3)\n\nThis is still better than walking away (409.13 < 567), but this offer is much more reasonable than my previous one and gives Player 1 more items. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement in the final round.\n\nHowever, since my outside offer (567) is so high compared to what I can realistically get from negotiation, and we're already in round 2, it makes more sense to walk away.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 198. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 936 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 2, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    93 x 0 + 33 x 0 + 85 x 0 + 95 x 2 + 6 x 1\n    which is 196 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 198. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

A good starting point is to evaluate what items Player 2 seems to value (based on their previous offer) and adjust accordingly. Player 2 offered all 3 units of Item 1 and 3 units of Item 4. Therefore, retaining these seems wise.\n\n    Let's try to offer Player 2 [0, 1, 1, 0, 1].\n\n    *   My remaining items: 3 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5\n    *   Value of this counteroffer to me: (3 * 93) + (1 * 33) + (1 * 85) + (4 * 95) + (2 * 6) = 279 + 33 + 85 + 380 + 12 = 789\n    *   Discounted value of this counteroffer: 789 * 0.98 = 773.22\n\n    Since 773.22 > 198, this is a reasonable counteroffer that is far better than my outside offer. It also allows me to test how much Player 2 values Items 1 and 4.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Accepting the current offer is better than walking away.\n*   However, I believe I can get an even better deal by making a counteroffer.\n\nTherefore, I will make the counteroffer [0, 1, 1, 0, 1].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 1, 0, 1]}\n```",

Since this is round 2, I need to be strategic. If I'm too aggressive, Player 1 might walk away or counter with something less favorable in round 3.\n\nLooking at my values, items 2 and 5 are most valuable to me (93 and 100), followed by item 3 (64). Items 1 and 4 are less valuable (21 and 20).\n\nThe current offer is actually quite good for me as it gives me 1 unit each of my three most valuable items.\n\nHowever, I might try to get one more high-value item. Since item 5 is my most valuable at 100 per unit, I'll try to get one more unit of that.\n\nMy counteroffer:\n- I would give Player 1: [3 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 4 of item 4, 1 of item 5]\n- I would keep: [0 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 0 of item 4, 2 of item 5]\n\nThis would give me: (0 \u00d7 21) + (2 \u00d7 93) + (1 \u00d7 64) + (0 \u00d7 20) + (2 \u00d7 100) = 450\n\nGiven that the current offer is already better than my outside option, and there's only one round left with further discounting, I think the current offer from Player 1 is actually quite reasonable.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 2, 0, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    47 x 0 + 65 x 1 + 52 x 2 + 45 x 0 + 54 x 5\n    which is 439 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 440. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

This means that an offer accepted in a later round is worth slightly less. I will want to conclude earlier rather than later, assuming the offers are similar.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   There is no current offer on the table.\n*   I need to formulate an initial offer. I want to maximize my value, but also make the offer attractive enough that Player 2 doesn't immediately walk away. I need to keep in mind that I can make three offers max.\n*   I will begin by offering Player 2 a relatively even split of items and see how they respond. I will calculate the value of the items I keep to ensure they are greater than my outside offer.\n\nLet's try keeping 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 3 units of item 5.

This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 2, 0, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    47 x 0 + 65 x 1 + 52 x 2 + 45 x 0 + 54 x 5\n    which is 439 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 440. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 1, 2, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 2, 1, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 2, 1, 4]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 440\n*   **Values of the items:** Item 1: 47, Item 2: 65, Item 3: 52, Item 4: 45, Item 5: 54\n*   **Total pool of items:** Item 1: 2, Item 2: 4, Item 3: 3, Item 4: 3, Item 5: 6\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.98. This means an offer in the next round is worth 0.98 times the value of an equivalent offer this round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [1, 1, 2, 1, 4]. This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 1 unit\n    *   Item 2: 3 units\n    *   Item 3: 1 unit\n    *   Item 4: 2 units\n    *   Item 5: 2 units\n    My value for this offer is: (1 * 47) + (3 * 65) + (1 * 52) + (2 * 45) + (2 * 54) = 47 + 195 + 52 + 90 + 108 = 492\n\n*   **Comparing to outside offer:** The current offer is worth 492, which is greater than my outside offer of 440.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Since the current offer is better than my outside offer, I could accept it. However, it is round 2, and I could try to get a better deal for myself. I need to be careful not to make an offer that is worse for me than my outside offer or worse than my previous offer.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I keep more items. I'll try to get a little more of each item. I offered [1, 2, 1, 2, 3] in the previous round, and Player 2 countered with [1, 1, 2, 1, 4]. Let's propose keeping one more of item 2. A counteroffer where I offer Player 2 [1, 0, 2, 1, 4]\n*   Item 1: 1 unit\n*   Item 2: 4 units\n*   Item 3: 1 unit\n*   Item 4: 2 units\n*   Item 5: 2 units\nMy value for this offer is: (1 * 47) + (4 * 65) + (1 * 52) + (2 * 45) + (2 * 54) = 47 + 260 + 52 + 90 + 108 = 557\n557 > 492, so this is better than the current offer.\nNow I check this compared to my previous counteroffer. I had a value of x after offering Player 2 [1, 2, 1, 2, 3] in round 1, I do not know player 2's values, so I cannot make a valid comparison with that round.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince my current offer is better than my outside offer, but I think I can get a better deal, and I have confirmed that the new counteroffer is better than my outside offer, I will make the counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 2, 1, 4]}\n```",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 423. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 423. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1008 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 2, 5, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    91 x 0 + 82 x 0 + 93 x 2 + 13 x 5 + 57 x 3\n    which is 422 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 423. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 2, 1, 4, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 1, 0, 5, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 1, 0, 5, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 423\n*   My values for the items: 91 for item 1, 82 for item 2, 93 for item 3, 13 for item 4, 57 for item 5.\n*   Total pool of items: 6 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 9 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5.\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.98. This means that accepting an offer in a later round is slightly less valuable than accepting the same offer in an earlier round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [3, 1, 0, 5, 2]. This means I would receive:\n    *   3 units of item 1: 3 * 91 = 273\n    *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 82 = 82\n    *   0 units of item 3: 0 * 93 = 0\n    *   5 units of item 4: 5 * 13 = 65\n    *   2 units of item 5: 2 * 57 = 114\n    *   Total value of current offer: 273 + 82 + 0 + 65 + 114 = 534\n    Since this is round 2, the discounted value of this offer is 534 * 0.98 = 523.32. This is better than my outside offer of 423.\n\n*   **Previous offer from Player 1**: This information is irrelevant to my current decision because it is not a valid offer on the table.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what counteroffers I can make. I must give Player 2 some of each item to entice Player 2 to accept.\n\n    * If I offered Player 2 [3,1,1,4,2] that means I keep:\n        * 3 units of item 1: 3 * 91 = 273\n        * 3 units of item 2: 3 * 82 = 246\n        * 1 units of item 3: 1 * 93 = 93\n        * 5 units of item 4: 5 * 13 = 65\n        * 2 units of item 5: 2 * 57 = 114\n        * Total value of counteroffer: 273+246+93+65+114=791\n        Since this is round 2, the discounted value of this offer is 791 * 0.98 = 775.18\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (discounted value = 523.32) and counteroffer (discounted value = 775.18) are better than my outside offer (423).\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer of [3, 1, 0, 5, 2] has a discounted value of 523.32 to me, which is greater than my outside offer of 423.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 234. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 789 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 4, 0, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    19 x 2 + 31 x 4 + 55 x 0 + 71 x 1 + 87 x 0\n    which is 233 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 234. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 2, 2, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 1, 3, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 3, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best course of action for round 1.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** 195\n*   **Item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 57\n    *   Item 2: 69\n    *   Item 3: 27\n    *   Item 4: 72\n    *   Item 5: 82\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 4\n    *   Item 2: 3\n    *   Item 3: 9\n    *   Item 4: 4\n    *   Item 5: 3\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.98. This means that the value of a deal decreases by 2% each round. In the first round, the discount factor is 0.98^(1-1) = 1.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer. It is Round 1, so it is not necessarily about maximizing the immediate gain, but rather making a reasonable offer that the other player might accept, allowing for further negotiation.\n*   **Considerations:** I need to be mindful of the five mistakes.\n\n3) **Making a decision:**\n\nLet's start by calculating the total value of all items to me:\n\n(4 \\* 57) + (3 \\* 69) + (9 \\* 27) + (4 \\* 72) + (3 \\* 82) = 228 + 207 + 243 + 288 + 246 = 1212\n\nSince there's no current offer, I need to make the first offer. A good starting point would be to offer roughly half the value. I will start by offering the other player approximately half of each item. Because I value item 5 highly, I want to offer less of that and because I value item 3 less, I will offer more of that. This is just a starting point and should leave enough room for further negotiation. Let's offer the following:\n\n*   Item 1: 2\n*   Item 2: 1\n*   Item 3: 5\n*   Item 4: 2\n*   Item 5: 1\n\nNow, let's calculate what I would keep and its value:\n\n*   Item 1: 4 - 2 = 2. Value = 2 \\* 57 = 114\n*   Item 2: 3 - 1 = 2. Value = 2 \\* 69 = 138\n*   Item 3: 9 - 5 = 4. Value = 4 \\* 27 = 108\n*   Item 4: 4 - 2 = 2. Value = 2 \\* 72 = 144\n*   Item 5: 3 - 1 = 2. Value = 2 \\* 82 = 164\n\nTotal value = 114 + 138 + 108 + 144 + 164 = 668.

Items 4 and 5 have low value to me, so I could offer more of those to Player 1.\n\nLet me propose a counteroffer where I give:\n- 2 units of item 1 (keeping 2)\n- 1 unit of item 2 (keeping 2)\n- 3 units of item 3 (keeping 6)\n- 3 units of item 4 (keeping 1)\n- 2 units of item 5 (keeping 1)\n\nThis would give me a value of:\n(2\u00d717) + (2\u00d741) + (6\u00d733) + (1\u00d78) + (1\u00d74) = 34 + 82 + 198 + 8 + 4 = 326\n\nThis is significantly better than the current offer (260) and my outside option (199).\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 3, 3, 2]}",

                    "prompt": "\n    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\n    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\n    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\n    There are 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 9 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\n    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\n    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 101.\n    Your private values are 57 for item 1, 69 for item 2, 27 for item 3, 72 for item 4, 82 for item 5.\n    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to your total value of all items, which is 1212. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 195. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 195. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 921 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 2, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    57 x 1 + 69 x 0 + 27 x 2 + 72 x 0 + 82 x 1\n    which is 193 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 195. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 5, 2, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 1, 3, 3, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 3, 3, 2]\n\n    What is your action?
