My goal is to get Player 2 to accept an offer that gives me more than my outside offer of 933. I don't know Player 2's values, so I need to make a reasonable offer that Player 2 might find attractive.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 5, 2, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    1 x 0 + 41 x 0 + 51 x 5 + 33 x 2 + 17 x 5\n    which is 406 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 407. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "To make a well-informed decision regarding the current offer, let's walk through the analysis step by step:\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 407.\n   - The values of items involved for me are:\n     - Item 1: 1 per unit\n     - Item 2: 41 per unit\n     - Item 3: 51 per unit\n     - Item 4: 33 per unit\n     - Item 5: 17 per unit\n   - The total pool of items consists of:\n     - Item 1: 2 units\n     - Item 2: 3 units\n     - Item 3: 5 units\n     - Item 4: 5 units\n     - Item 5: 5 units\n   - The discount factor (gamma) of 0.98 influences the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers by reducing the present value of future outcomes.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer value if I accept it:\n     - 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 1 = 0\n     - 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 41 = 0\n     - 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 51 = 0\n     - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 33 = 33\n     - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 17 = 0\n     - Total value of the current offer = 33\n   - Compare the current offer (33) to my outside offer value (407). The current offer is significantly less valuable than my outside offer.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - The current offer is not acceptable because it's worth only 33, whereas my outside offer is 407. \n   - Since the current offer does not meet or exceed the outside offer, I should not accept it or walk away at this stage.\n   - I should propose a counteroffer that surpasses my outside offer's value but remains beneficial enough for Player 1 to potentially consider it.\n\n   To create a valid counteroffer that provides me with more value than my outside offer (407), I need to keep sufficient items to cross that threshold. For example, if I propose:\n   - Keeping 5 units of item 3 = 5 \u00d7 51 = 255\n   - Keeping 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 41 = 82\n   - Keeping 5 units of item 4 = 5 \u00d7 33 = 165\n   - Keeping 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 17 = 0\n   - Keeping 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 1 = 1\n\n   Total value = 255 + 82 + 165 + 0 + 1 = 503\n\n   This counterproposal keeps the total value above my outside offer (407), making it a solid counteroffer.\n\nThus, my action is to make a counteroffer:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 0, 5]}\n```\nThis counteroffer gives Player 1 one unit of item 1, one unit of item 2, no units of item 3, no units of item 4, and all 5 units of item 5.",

There's also a discount factor to consider.\n\nSince there's no offer on the table, I need to make an initial offer. To do this effectively, I should consider my own valuations and try to anticipate Player 2's potential valuations. I'll start by making an offer that is slightly better than my outside option, while also trying to determine what Player 2 might want.\n\nMy values are:\nItem 1: 39 (5 units)\nItem 2: 49 (4 units)\nItem 3: 13 (1 unit)\nItem 4: 57 (5 units)\nItem 5: 90 (3 units)\nOutside offer: 636\n\nLet's consider offering a split where I keep the items I value most highly. I highly value Item 5 at 90 per unit and Item 4 at 57 per unit. Let's offer Player 2 all of item 1 and item 2 and the only item 3.\n\nSo offer Player 2:\nItem 1: 5\nItem 2: 4\nItem 3: 1\n\nThis means I keep:\nItem 4: 5\nItem 5: 3\n\nThe value of what I keep is:\n5 * 57 + 3 * 90 = 285 + 270 = 555\n\nThis offer is not good because it is less than my outside option of 636.\n\nLet's try offering player 2 items 1, 2 and some of item 4.\nItem 1: 5\nItem 2: 4\nItem 4: 1\n\nThis means I keep:\nItem 3: 1\nItem 4: 4\nItem 5: 3\n\nThe value of what I keep is:\n1 * 13 + 4 * 57 + 3 * 90 = 13 + 228 + 270 = 511.\n\nThis offer is also not good enough.\n\nLet's construct an offer that gives me a value greater than 636. I will aim to keep all of items 4 and 5, and one of item 1. That would give me a value of 1 * 39 + 5 * 57 + 3 * 90 = 39 + 285 + 270 = 594. This is still not better than my outside offer.\n\nLet me keep item 2, and give items 1 and 3. Then the calculation is, 5*57 + 3*90 + 4*49 = 285 + 270 + 196 = 751.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    61 x 0 + 78 x 0 + 100 x 0 + 76 x 0 + 23 x 3\n    which is 69 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 73. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [5, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [5, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

For round 1, the overall value is not discounted, because (r-1) = 0.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 0, 2, 7] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    62 x 1 + 38 x 0 + 88 x 0 + 41 x 2 + 43 x 7\n    which is 445 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 452. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 1, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 0, 1, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

As this is round 1, I should consider making a counteroffer to see if I can secure a deal better than 452.\n   - I should propose a counteroffer that provides me with a value greater than 452.\n\nTo develop a counteroffer, I need to keep enough units to exceed my outside offer value. I'll consider making a counteroffer where I retain a major portion of high-value items for me (items 3 and 5) and adjust the rest to ensure I exceed my outside offer value. Here's a potential counteroffer:\n\n- I could offer Player 1 all units of item 2, and one unit each of item 1 and 4, retaining the rest:\n\n  If I keep:\n  - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 62 = 124\n  - 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 38 = 0\n  - 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 88 = 0\n  - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 41 = 82\n  - 7 units of item 5 = 7 \u00d7 43 = 301\n\n  Total value = 124 + 0 + 0 + 82 + 301 = 507\n\n  This total value is greater than my outside offer (452) and significantly exceeds the previous offer value of 270.\n\nTherefore, the counteroffer I will propose is to give Player 1 the following units:\n\n- Offer to Player 1: [1, 2, 0, 1, 0]\n\nHere's my action in the required format:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 0, 1, 0]}\n```",

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 1, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 2, 0, 1, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 0, 2, 2]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [1, 2, 0, 0, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 0, 0, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

Since 346 < 483, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. Since it's the last round, if Player 2 doesn't accept my counteroffer, I will end up with my outside offer, 483. This means that Player 2 will walk away. Therefore, I want to construct the counteroffer such that player 2 would like to accept.\n\nI have the following items to distribute:\n\n*   Item 1: 3 units\n*   Item 2: 2 units\n*   Item 3: 0 units\n*   Item 4: 3 units\n*   Item 5: 7 units\n\nThe current offer from Player 2 to me is [1, 2, 0, 0, 2]. This means I keep 1 item 1, 2 item 2, 0 item 3, 0 item 4, and 2 item 5.\n\nLet's consider offering player 2 all of my items. This means my offer is [3, 2, 0, 3, 7]. This gives me zero value. This is bad.\n\nLet us calculate what I would have if I accepted player 2's last offer:\nI receive [1, 2, 0, 0, 2]. This implies that player 2 gets:\nitem 1: 3 - 1 = 2\nitem 2: 2 - 2 = 0\nitem 3: 0 - 0 = 0\nitem 4: 3 - 0 = 3\nitem 5: 7 - 2 = 5\nTherefore, player 2 receives [2, 0, 0, 3, 5]\n\nI want to get as close to my outside offer as possible. Let's offer player 2 just enough so that they might accept. I will try giving everything else to myself, except for a little bit.\n\nSince my current value is 346, to get 483, I need 483 - 346 = 137 more value.\n\nI will propose keeping 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4 and 5 units of item 5, and give the remainder of the items to player 2. The offer to player 2 would be [1, 0, 0, 1, 2].\nMy value = (2 * 94) + (2 * 30) + (0 * 51) + (2 * 3) + (5 * 96) = 188 + 60 + 0 + 6 + 480 = 734\nSince 734 > 483, this is good.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 0, 2, 7] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    62 x 1 + 38 x 0 + 88 x 0 + 41 x 2 + 43 x 7\n    which is 445 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 452. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 1, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 2, 0, 1, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 0, 2, 2]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [1, 2, 0, 0, 2]\nRound 3: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 0, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

I want to maximize my outcome, but also make an offer that Player 2 is likely to accept, either now or in a later round.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 519. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1074 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 0, 0, 4, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    95 x 3 + 84 x 0 + 69 x 0 + 41 x 4 + 69 x 1\n    which is 518 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 519. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Thus, the rational move would be to make this counteroffer.\n\nThus, my action will be:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 2, 1, 3, 2]}\n```",

A good starting point is to consider an equal split and then adjust it to favor myself while still being potentially acceptable to Player 2. It's important to remember that I don't know Player 2's values, so I have to make some assumptions.\n\nLet's start with an equal split, rounding down the number of items Player 2 receives:\n*   Item 1: 1\n*   Item 2: 1\n*   Item 3: 1\n*   Item 4: 1\n*   Item 5: 2\n\nNow, calculate the value of what I would *keep* with this offer:\n*   Item 1: 1 * 10 = 10\n*   Item 2: 1 * 19 = 19\n*   Item 3: 2 * 73 = 146\n*   Item 4: 2 * 74 = 148\n*   Item 5: 3 * 31 = 93\n*   Total value: 10 + 19 + 146 + 148 + 93 = 416\n\nThis value (416) is less than my outside offer (454).

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 1, 3, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    57 x 0 + 39 x 2 + 69 x 1 + 4 x 3 + 75 x 4\n    which is 459 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 461. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

So, the present value of this offer is 93 * 0.98 = 91.14.\n\nMy outside offer is 454. Since 91.14 is less than 454, accepting this offer would be worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. I need to offer something that Player 2 might accept. To start, I offered [1, 1, 0, 0, 3] in round 1, and Player 2 responded with [0, 0, 0, 0, 3]. This suggests Player 2 wants most of item 5 and doesn't value the other items highly. Since they countered with such a bad offer to me, my initial offer was likely too generous to them. I'm going to be more aggressive.\n\nI'll try offering Player 2 more of Item 5 while keeping more of other items, which I value more. I will offer [0, 0, 1, 1, 4] to Player 2. This means I get 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n\nLet's calculate the value to me:\n2 * 10 + 2 * 19 + 2 * 73 + 2 * 74 + 1 * 31 = 20 + 38 + 146 + 148 + 31 = 383.\nDiscounted value = 383 * 0.98 = 375.34\n\nStill less than my outside offer.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 1, 3, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    57 x 0 + 39 x 2 + 69 x 1 + 4 x 3 + 75 x 4\n    which is 459 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 461. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Since this is the first round, I have no offer to accept yet. I need to make a counteroffer that is likely to be accepted by Player 2, or else walk away if I think I can't get a better deal than my outside offer of 425.\n\nFirst, I need to determine a reasonable initial offer. Since I don't know Player 2's values, I will assume they are also trying to maximize their utility. I will aim for a split that gives me a value close to my outside option, while leaving enough for Player 2 to accept. It's a bit of a gamble at this stage, but a reasonable opening offer is necessary.\n\nI have 4 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5. My values are 73, 32, 19, 3, and 16 respectively.\n\nA simple equal split (or as close as possible) might be a starting point, but it does not take my private valuations into account. I want to keep more of the items that I value highly.\n\nLet's consider giving Player 2 half the items and seeing where that lands:\n- Item 1: 2 units to Player 2 (I keep 2) -> 2*73 = 146\n- Item 2: 1 unit to Player 2 (I keep 1) -> 1*32 = 32\n- Item 3: 2 units to Player 2 (I keep 3) -> 3*19 = 57\n- Item 4: 2 units to Player 2 (I keep 3) -> 3*3 = 9\n- Item 5: 1 unit to Player 2 (I keep 2) -> 2*16 = 32\nTotal value to me = 146 + 32 + 57 + 9 + 32 = 276\n\nThis is below my outside option of 425. Let's try giving less to Player 2:\n- Item 1: 1 unit to Player 2 (I keep 3) -> 3*73 = 219\n- Item 2: 0 unit to Player 2 (I keep 2) -> 2*32 = 64\n- Item 3: 2 unit to Player 2 (I keep 3) -> 3*19 = 57\n- Item 4: 2 unit to Player 2 (I keep 3) -> 3*3 = 9\n- Item 5: 1 unit to Player 2 (I keep 2) -> 2*16 = 32\nTotal value to me = 219 + 64 + 57 + 9 + 32 = 381\n\nStill a bit low. I need to aim higher. Let's modify slightly, keeping more of item 3 as well.\n\n- Item 1: 1 unit to Player 2 (I keep 3) -> 3*73 = 219\n- Item 2: 0 unit to Player 2 (I keep 2) -> 2*32 = 64\n- Item 3: 1 unit to Player 2 (I keep 4) -> 4*19 = 76\n- Item 4: 2 unit to Player 2 (I keep 3) -> 3*3 = 9\n- Item 5: 1 unit to Player 2 (I keep 2) -> 2*16 = 32\nTotal value to me = 219 + 64 + 76 + 9 + 32 = 400\n\nStill a bit low. Let's try increasing what I keep of Item 4\n\n- Item 1: 1 unit to Player 2 (I keep 3) -> 3*73 = 219\n- Item 2: 0 unit to Player 2 (I keep 2) -> 2*32 = 64\n- Item 3: 1 unit to Player 2 (I keep 4) -> 4*19 = 76\n- Item 4: 1 unit to Player 2 (I keep 4) -> 4*3 = 12\n- Item 5: 1 unit to Player 2 (I keep 2) -> 2*16 = 32\nTotal value to me = 219 + 64 + 76 + 12 + 32 = 403\n\nStill low. Let's try giving the following to player 2, keeping the remainder for myself\n\n- Item 1: 1\n- Item 2: 0\n- Item 3: 0\n- Item 4: 3\n- Item 5: 1\n\nValue to me:\n- Item 1: 3 * 73 = 219\n- Item 2: 2 * 32 = 64\n- Item 3: 5 * 19 = 95\n- Item 4: 2 * 3 = 6\n- Item 5: 2 * 16 = 32\nTotal = 416\n\nOkay, this is getting closer but below my outside offer, let's keep more of item 4.\n- Item 1: 1\n- Item 2: 0\n- Item 3: 0\n- Item 4: 2\n- Item 5: 1\n\nValue to me:\n- Item 1: 3 * 73 = 219\n- Item 2: 2 * 32 = 64\n- Item 3: 5 * 19 = 95\n- Item 4: 3 * 3 = 9\n- Item 5: 2 * 16 = 32\nTotal = 419\nLet's make one more adjustment, let's keep more of Item 5\n\n- Item 1: 1\n- Item 2: 0\n- Item 3: 0\n- Item 4: 2\n- Item 5: 0\n\nValue to me:\n- Item 1: 3 * 73 = 219\n- Item 2: 2 * 32 = 64\n- Item 3: 5 * 19 = 95\n- Item 4: 3 * 3 = 9\n- Item 5: 3 * 16 = 48\nTotal = 435\n\nThis exceeds my outside offer!\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 2, 0]}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 3, 0, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    19 x 0 + 77 x 1 + 19 x 3 + 22 x 0 + 20 x 3\n    which is 194 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 195. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 0, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\n**Round 2, Current Offer:** Player 2 is offering me [1, 0, 0, 4, 3]. This means they keep:\n\n*   Item 1: 4 - 1 = 3 units\n*   Item 2: 2 - 0 = 2 units\n*   Item 3: 5 - 0 = 5 units\n*   Item 4: 5 - 4 = 1 unit\n*   Item 5: 3 - 3 = 0 units\n\n**My Values:** My values are 73, 32, 19, 3, 16 for items 1 through 5, respectively.\n\n**Value of Current Offer:**\n\n*   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 73 = 73\n*   0 units of item 2: 0 * 32 = 0\n*   0 units of item 3: 0 * 19 = 0\n*   4 units of item 4: 4 * 3 = 12\n*   3 units of item 5: 3 * 16 = 48\n\nTotal value of current offer: 73 + 0 + 0 + 12 + 48 = 133\n\n**Discounted Value:** Since this is round 2, the discount factor is 0.98^(2-1) = 0.98\n\nDiscounted value of current offer: 133 * 0.98 = 130.34\n\n**Comparison to Outside Offer:** My outside offer is 425. The discounted value of accepting the current offer is 130.34, which is significantly less than my outside offer.\n\n**Counteroffer Considerations:** I need to make a counteroffer that gives Player 2 enough value for them to accept, while still giving me a value greater than 425 (after discounting). It's round 2, so I need to consider that if I make a counteroffer, and they reject, in round 3 they could walk, giving me 425. Thus, any counteroffer I make needs to yield more than 425.\n\n**Trying a Counteroffer:** Let me try offering Player 2 almost everything.\n\nOffer to Player 2: [4, 2, 5, 5, 3]\nThis leaves me with nothing. Value to me = 0 * 0.98 = 0. That's much worse than walking.\n\nLet me try to only improve slightly on Player 2's round 1 offer to me, hoping they will bite. Their offer was [1, 0, 0, 4, 3] to me (meaning I keep 1, 0, 0, 4, 3).\n\nMy round 1 offer to them was [1, 0, 0, 2, 0] (meaning I keep 3, 2, 5, 3, 3). This yielded a value of 3*73 + 2*32 + 5*19 + 3*3 + 3*16 = 219 + 64 + 95 + 9 + 48 = 435\n\nSince it is round 2, the value is actually 435*0.98 = 426.30 which is still > 425.\nI will try to offer a slight improvement on their offer to me in Round 1, so they are incentivized to accept now.\n\nCounteroffer to Player 2: [0, 0, 0, 1, 2]\n\nThis leaves me with: 4, 2, 5, 4, 1. My value is then:\n4*73 + 2*32 + 5*19 + 4*3 + 1*16 = 292 + 64 + 95 + 12 + 16 = 479.\nDiscounted value is 479 * 0.98 = 469.42. This is > 425.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 1, 2]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 3, 0, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    19 x 0 + 77 x 1 + 19 x 3 + 22 x 0 + 20 x 3\n    which is 194 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 195. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 2, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 0, 4, 3]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 0, 3, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    81 x 0 + 27 x 2 + 75 x 0 + 88 x 3 + 10 x 3\n    which is 348 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 349. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 0, 3, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    81 x 0 + 27 x 2 + 75 x 0 + 88 x 3 + 10 x 3\n    which is 348 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 349. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 3, 2, 4, 3]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

My total value would be 0, which is less than my outside offer of 349.\n   - Evaluating potential counteroffers, I want to ensure any new proposal is better than my outside offer, which should yield a value over 349 for me.\n\n3) Make a decision:\n   - Accepting the current offer from Player 1 is not beneficial because it gives me 0 value, which is less than my outside offer.\n   - Walking away is an option if I cannot secure a better deal through a counteroffer.\n   - To make a counteroffer, let's ensure I propose keeping items that would bring my total value above 349.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I keep:\n- 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 81 = 243\n- 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 27 = 54\n- 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 75 = 150\n- 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 88 = 176\n- 0 units of item 5: 0 \u00d7 10 = 0\nTotal value: 243 + 54 + 150 + 176 = 623\n\nThis keeps my value well above my outside offer of 349.

To determine a good offer, I need to think about Player 2's perspective, *without knowing their actual values*.\n\nA reasonable starting point is to offer a split where Player 2 gets slightly more than half of the total value, assuming they also have fairly similar valuations. I will aim to get close to the outside offer in the first round so that walking in the second round is still a favorable option.\n\nLet's start by making an offer that gives Player 2 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5. I'll calculate what this offer is worth *to me* if I keep the remaining items and compare it to the outside offer value.\n\n**Calculating Value of Proposed Offer (to me):**\n\n*   **Item 1:** I keep 2 units * 74 = 148\n*   **Item 2:** I keep 1 unit * 78 = 78\n*   **Item 3:** I keep 2 units * 70 = 140\n*   **Item 4:** I keep 2 units * 94 = 188\n*   **Item 5:** I keep 2 units * 64 = 128\n*   **Total Value:** 148 + 78 + 140 + 188 + 128 = 682\n\n682 is greater than 94, so now I need to consider how this offer could be accepted by Player 2.\n\nNow, I am going to try a more skewed offer to attempt to get a better deal for myself in round 1.\n\nLet's offer Player 2:\n* Item 1: 1 unit\n* Item 2: 0 units\n* Item 3: 1 unit\n* Item 4: 1 unit\n* Item 5: 1 unit\n\nThis would give me:\n* Item 1: 3 * 74 = 222\n* Item 2: 2 * 78 = 156\n* Item 3: 2 * 70 = 140\n* Item 4: 3 * 94 = 282\n* Item 5: 3 * 64 = 192\nTotal: 222 + 156 + 140 + 282 + 192 = 992\n\nEven with a discount factor of 0.98 applied for the next round, if they counter offer, that still leaves me at a higher value.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 3, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    23 x 0 + 54 x 0 + 53 x 0 + 84 x 3 + 78 x 0\n    which is 252 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 253. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

The purpose of the discount factor is to reduce the value of offers each round as negotiations continue.\n\n### 2) Assess the value of offers\n\n- **Current Offer**: The current offer from Player 1 is [1, 0, 1, 1, 1] (the items I would get).\n  - Value calculation:\n    - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 23 = 23\n    - 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 54 = 0\n    - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 53 = 53\n    - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 84 = 84\n    - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 78 = 78\n  - Total value = 23 + 0 + 53 + 84 + 78 = 238\n\n  Since the current offer value (238) is less than my outside offer value (253), accepting this offer would be a Mistake 4. Therefore, I should not accept this offer.\n\n- **Potential Counteroffers**:\n  - Let's evaluate a potential counteroffer that would give me a value greater than 253. For example, keeping more units of higher-value items.\n\n  A possible counteroffer proposal could be [1, 0, 1, 0, 2] to Player 1, keeping [3, 2, 2, 4, 2] for myself:\n  - Value calculation:\n    - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 23 = 69\n    - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 54 = 108\n    - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 53 = 106\n    - 4 units of item 4 = 4 \u00d7 84 = 336\n    - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 78 = 156\n  - Total value = 69 + 108 + 106 + 336 + 156 = 775\n\n  My calculated total value (775) is significantly higher than my outside offer (253) and also higher than the current offer value (238).\n\n### 3) Make a decision based on the analysis\n\nGiven that the current offer is worse than my outside offer value, I should neither accept it nor walk away, as I have identified a better counteroffer. Therefore, I should proceed with making a counteroffer that aligns with my objective of maximizing value.\n\n### Proposed Action\n\nI will make the following counteroffer proposal:\n- Counteroffer to Player 1: [1, 0, 1, 0, 2]\n\nThis proposed change allows me to maximize my potential value from the negotiation while staying above my outside offer value.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 0, 2]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 3, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    23 x 0 + 54 x 0 + 53 x 0 + 84 x 3 + 78 x 0\n    which is 252 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 253. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 0, 2, 3, 7] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    22 x 4 + 37 x 0 + 94 x 2 + 19 x 3 + 41 x 7\n    which is 620 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 621. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 2, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 2, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

Then I would keep 5 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 7 units of item 5. 5*75 + 2*59 + 3*60 + 3*23 + 7*7 = 375 + 118 + 180 + 69 + 49 = 791\nDiscounted = 791 * 0.98 = 775.18 > 478. Seems like a good option to offer close to the current offer.\nLet me offer them 0, 0, 0, 1, 0.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 621. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 639 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 0, 2, 3, 7] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    22 x 4 + 37 x 0 + 94 x 2 + 19 x 3 + 41 x 7\n    which is 620 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 621. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 2, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To decide on the best action, let's analyze the situation step by step following the given structure:\n\n### 1) Analyze the Current Situation:\n\n- **My Outside Offer Value:** 621\n- **Values of the Items to Me:**\n  - Item 1: 22\n  - Item 2: 37\n  - Item 3: 94\n  - Item 4: 19\n  - Item 5: 41\n- **Total Pool of Items:**\n  - 5 units of item 1\n  - 2 units of item 2\n  - 3 units of item 3\n  - 4 units of item 4\n  - 7 units of item 5\n- **Current Offer: [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]**\n- **Discount Factor (gamma):** 0.98\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n\n#### Current Offer Evaluation:\n- From the current offer, I receive:\n  - 0 units of item 1 = 0 value\n  - 0 units of item 2 = 0 value\n  - 0 units of item 3 = 0 value\n  - 1 unit of item 4 = 19 value\n  - 0 units of item 5 = 0 value\n- Total value of current offer = 19\n- With the discount factor in round 2, current offer value = 19 * 0.98^1 = 18.62\n\n#### Outside Offer Comparison:\n- My outside offer value = 621\n\nSince 18.62 is far less than 621, accepting the current offer would be significantly worse than taking the outside offer.\n\n#### Potential Counteroffers:\nTo prevent mistakes, I need to ensure my counteroffer is greater than 621. Let me calculate a few potential counteroffers:\n\n1. Offer [2, 0, 1, 3, 4] (I keep [3, 2, 2, 1, 3]):\n   - 3 units of item 1 = 3 * 22 = 66\n   - 2 units of item 2 = 2 * 37 = 74\n   - 2 units of item 3 = 2 * 94 = 188\n   - 1 units of item 4 = 1 * 19 = 19\n   - 3 units of item 5 = 3 * 41 = 123\n   - Total value = 470\n\n2. Offer [1, 0, 0, 1, 0] (I keep [4, 2, 3, 3, 7]):\n   - 4 units of item 1 = 4 * 22 = 88\n   - 2 units of item 2 = 2 * 37 = 74\n   - 3 units of item 3 = 3 * 94 = 282\n   - 3 units of item 4 = 3 * 19 = 57\n   - 7 units of item 5 = 7 * 41 = 287\n   - Total value = 788\n   \nThe second proposal yields a value significantly higher than my outside offer (788 vs. 621). The first proposal\u2019s value (470) is less than my outside offer, so it would be a mistake.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision:\n\nGiven these evaluations, I will propose a counteroffer that maximizes my outcome while avoiding the five potential mistakes. Hence, I will counter with:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]}",

Since 94.1192 < 478, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. Since it's the last round, if Player 2 rejects my counteroffer, I get my outside offer. So, I want to make an offer that is good enough for Player 2 to accept, but also gives me a value greater than 478 (after the discount factor).\n\nThe total items available are:\nItem 1: 5\nItem 2: 2\nItem 3: 3\nItem 4: 4\nItem 5: 7\n\nI currently have:\nItem 1: 4\nItem 2: 2\nItem 3: 3\nItem 4: 3\nItem 5: 7\n\nMy total value is (5 * 75) + (2 * 59) + (3 * 60) + (4 * 23) + (7 * 7) = 375 + 118 + 180 + 92 + 49 = 814\n\nThe current offer to me is [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]. This means they are offering me 1 of item 1 and 1 of item 4. I will calculate what my total will be if I accept it:\nMy value = (1*75)+(1*23) = 98\n\nTo beat my outside offer of 478 (after discount), I need 478/0.9604 = 497.7093 approximately.\n\nIt is now Round 3. Player 2 has already made an offer in Round 2. If I make a counteroffer, and Player 2 rejects it, then I will WALK. So I need to propose a deal which will be accepted. The previous offer of Player 2 was [1,0,0,1,0] to me.\n\nSince it's the last round, there's no point in trying to be too clever. I should just accept the current offer if it is better than walking away. Since 94.1192 is less than my outside offer of 478, I will walk away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 707. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 756 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 2, 2, 5, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    22 x 1 + 31 x 2 + 97 x 2 + 61 x 5 + 41 x 3\n    which is 706 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 707. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 2, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 2, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

However, if we choose to accept in round 1, this factor does not apply yet.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n\n   - Current offer from Player 1 is [1, 1, 1, 2, 2], which means I'm being offered:\n     - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 22 = 22\n     - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 31 = 31\n     - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 97 = 97\n     - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 61 = 122\n     - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 41 = 82\n   - Total value of current offer to me = 22 + 31 + 97 + 122 + 82 = 354\n\n   - Compare this to my outside offer value of 707; the current offer is significantly less beneficial.\n\n   - For a potential counteroffer, I want to ensure my proposal yields at least 707 in value to avoid making mistake 2. For example, if I propose giving:\n     - [0, 0, 0, 2, 2] to Player 1 and keep the rest (3, 2, 2, 3, 3) for myself:\n     - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66\n     - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 31 = 62\n     - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 97 = 194\n     - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183\n     - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123\n   - Total value of this potential counteroffer to me = 66 + 62 + 194 + 183 + 123 = 628\n\n   - Experiment with another division like keeping all but one of each item except item 4:\n     - Offer [1, 1, 1, 4, 4] to Player 1 and keep [2, 1, 1, 1, 1] for myself:\n     - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 22 = 44\n     - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 31 = 31\n     - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 97 = 97\n     - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 61 = 61\n     - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 41 = 41\n   - Total value of this alternative counteroffer to me = 44 + 31 + 97 + 61 + 41 = 274 (still not acceptable)\n\n   - For an advantageous offer better than my outside offer, I could choose to keep [3, 2, 2, 4, 3] while offering Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 1, 2]:\n     - Keep 3 units of item 1 = 66\n     - Keep 2 units of item 2 = 62\n     - Keep 2 units of item 3 = 194\n     - Keep 4 units of item 4 = 244\n     - Keep 3 units of item 5 = 123\n     - Total value = 66 + 62 + 194 + 244 + 123 = 689\n\n3) Make a decision:\n\n- Accepting the current offer is not sensible as it yields a value of 354, less than my outside offer of 707.\n- Walking away guarantees me 707 which is better than the current offer.\n- Proposing a beneficial counteroffer that better aligns with my objective of maximizing value above my outside offer requires crafting a more advantageous division.\n\nBased on the above analysis, my potential counteroffer needs to ensure a value of at least my offer value of 707. On reflection, the only accurate move right now while ensuring I adhere to the guidance of a minimum value is to WALK, as this ensures I obtain the value equivalent to my outside offer of 707.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 0, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    20 x 1 + 86 x 1 + 56 x 0 + 10 x 1 + 63 x 0\n    which is 116 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 118. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

This factor will reduce the value of the negotiation as rounds progress, emphasizing the importance of an early resolution.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n\n   - **Current Offer ([1, 1, 0, 0, 0]):**\n     - Value of item 1: 1 unit x 20 = 20\n     - Value of item 2: 1 unit x 86 = 86\n     - Value of item 3: 0 unit x 56 = 0\n     - Value of item 4: 0 unit x 10 = 0\n     - Value of item 5: 0 unit x 63 = 0\n     - Total value if accepting current offer = 20 + 86 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 106\n\n   - **Comparison with Outside Offer:** My outside offer is 118, which is higher than the current offer's value (106). Therefore, I should not accept this offer.\n\n   - **Potential Counteroffers:** \n     - I can explore a counteroffer that gives me a total value greater than 118. Let's evaluate an option:\n     - If I keep: [2, 1, 1, 1, 1] (giving Player 1: [2, 3, 0, 1, 2])\n       - Value of item 1: 2 units x 20 = 40\n       - Value of item 2: 1 unit x 86 = 86\n       - Value of item 3: 1 unit x 56 = 56\n       - Value of item 4: 1 unit x 10 = 10\n       - Value of item 5: 1 unit x 63 = 63\n       - Total value = 40 + 86 + 56 + 10 + 63 = 255\n\n     - This counteroffer results in a value (255) that is higher than my outside offer (118).\n\n3) **Make a Decision:**\n\n   Based on this analysis, it is clear that the current offer is not better than my outside offer, so accepting is not optimal. Walking away would give me a value of 118. Proposing a counteroffer that I evaluated, where I keep [2, 1, 1, 1, 1] (leaving Player 1 [2, 3, 0, 1, 2]), gives me a value of 255, which is more favorable than my outside offer and ensures I'm making a beneficial deal.\n\nTherefore, my action is:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 3, 0, 1, 2]}\n```",

This would be worth 1 * v1 + 1 * v2 + 0 * v3 + 0 * v4 + 0 * v5 to them. I have no idea what Player 2's values are, or their outside option. So, I should adjust my strategy towards achieving a win in this round. I need to secure at least 417.35 value.\n\nLet's aim for a split that gives me roughly 420. I'll keep most of the valuable items (items 1, 2, 3) and offer the remaining items (items 4 and 5) to player 2. I can calculate approximately what quantities of the items to offer to get the best chance of acceptance.\nSince the other player countered my initial offer and it seems they desire some units of items 1, 2, 4 and 5, I should make another offer that takes this into consideration to achieve an agreement.\n\nHere's a revised counteroffer: [1, 2, 0, 1, 1]\nThis offer gives player 2:\n1 unit of item 1\n2 units of item 2\n0 units of item 3\n1 unit of item 4\n1 unit of item 5\n\nWhich means I keep:\n3 units of item 1\n2 units of item 2\n1 unit of item 3\n1 unit of item 4\n2 units of item 5\n\nValue for me:\n3 * 52 + 2 * 52 + 1 * 64 + 1 * 3 + 2 * 45 = 156 + 104 + 64 + 3 + 90 = 417\n\nThe discounted value in the third round will be 417 * 0.98^2 = 400.95. However, if I offer this now and the player accepts, my discounted payoff will be 417 * 0.98 = 408.66.\n\nNow compare the current offer [2,3,0,1,2],\ndiscounted value of current offer = 353 * 0.98 = 345.94\nand a new counteroffer [1, 2, 0, 1, 1],\nwhich gives me 417 * 0.98 = 408.66\nSince 408.66 > 345.94 and is above my outside offer, let's make the counter offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 0, 1, 1]}\n```",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 118. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 118. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 705 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 0, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    20 x 1 + 86 x 1 + 56 x 0 + 10 x 1 + 63 x 0\n    which is 116 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 118. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 3, 0, 1, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 0, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 0, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

This factor should be considered when comparing the value of accepting the current offer versus future offers.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n- **Current Offer Evaluation ([1, 2, 0, 1, 1]):**\n  - 1 unit of Item 1: 1 \u00d7 20 = 20\n  - 2 units of Item 2: 2 \u00d7 86 = 172\n  - 0 units of Item 3: 0 \u00d7 56 = 0\n  - 1 unit of Item 4: 1 \u00d7 10 = 10\n  - 1 unit of Item 5: 1 \u00d7 63 = 63\n  - Total value = 265\n- When adjusted for one round elapsed with discount, value = 265 \u00d7 (0.98)^1 = 259.7\n\n- **Comparing with My Outside Offer (Value: 118):**\nThe current offer's discounted value (259.7) is significantly higher than my outside offer (118), indicating it's a beneficial deal.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n- **Accept the Current Offer?**\n  - The discounted value of the current offer (259.7) is much greater than my outside offer value (118).\n- **Walk Away?**\n  - This option gives me only 118, which is worse than accepting the current offer.\n- **Propose a Counteroffer?**\n  - Given the current offer's value after discount is significantly higher than my outside offer, trying to propose a more optimal counteroffer might unnecessarily prolong negotiation due to diminishing returns from the discount factor.\n\nConsidering the above analysis, the optimal decision is to accept the current offer because it maximizes my value under the current circumstances, avoids potential negotiation stalling penalties from discounting, and provides me a better payoff than the outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 0, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    10 x 0 + 99 x 2 + 55 x 0 + 8 x 1 + 70 x 1\n    which is 276 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 277. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 4, 1, 3, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 4, 1, 3, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

If player 2 has similar valuation as me, then this may be a good approach. I will construct an offer that leaves me with a value near my outside offer and hope that player 2 accepts in round 2, or that I can slightly improve the offer to player 2 in round 3 so that it still exceeds my outside option, when factoring in the discount rate.\n\nI will offer Player 2:\n- 2 units of item 1\n- 0 units of item 2\n- 0 units of item 3\n- 1 unit of item 4\n- 2 units of item 5\n\nThis leaves me with:\n- 3 units of item 1\n- 1 unit of item 2\n- 1 unit of item 3\n- 2 units of item 4\n- 3 units of item 5\n\nMy value would be: (3 * 83) + (1 * 35) + (1 * 91) + (2 * 28) + (3 * 35) = 249 + 35 + 91 + 56 + 105 = 536.\n\nThis is less than my outside offer.

Still less than outside option\n\nLet's try offering Player 2 the following:\n- 0 units of item 1\n- 0 units of item 2\n- 0 units of item 3\n- 0 unit of item 4\n- 0 units of item 5\n\nThis leaves me with:\n- 5 units of item 1\n- 1 unit of item 2\n- 1 unit of item 3\n- 3 units of item 4\n- 5 units of item 5\n\nMy value would be: (5 * 83) + (1 * 35) + (1 * 91) + (3 * 28) + (5 * 35) = 415 + 35 + 91 + 84 + 175 = 800\n\nThis is greater than my outside option, so let's make this offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 139. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 507 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 1, 3, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    10 x 2 + 59 x 0 + 13 x 1 + 35 x 3 + 52 x 0\n    which is 138 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 139. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "To evaluate the current situation and determine the optimal action, let's go through the step-by-step analysis:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n- **Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer value is 139.\n- **Values of Items Involved**:\n  - Item 1: 10 per unit\n  - Item 2: 59 per unit\n  - Item 3: 13 per unit\n  - Item 4: 35 per unit\n  - Item 5: 52 per unit\n- **Total Pool of Items**: 5 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 3 of item 4, 5 of item 5.\n- **Discount Factor**: This round is round 1, so the discount factor does not apply immediately. It would become relevant if the negotiation extends into the next rounds.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n- **Current Offer**: Player 1 is offering me [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], which has a total value of 0 for me.\n- **Potential Counteroffers**: I need to propose a division that gives me a total value greater than my outside offer of 139. I'll calculate a value-maximizing proposal:\n  - Optimal Keep for Myself to maximize my value: [5, 1, 1, 3, 5] which has a total value:\n    - 5 \u00d7 10 (Item 1) + 1 \u00d7 59 (Item 2) + 1 \u00d7 13 (Item 3) + 3 \u00d7 35 (Item 4) + 5 \u00d7 52 (Item 5) \n    = 50 + 59 + 13 + 105 + 260 = 487.\n\nSince 487 is above my outside offer value, I can adjust these values to ensure I still get more than my outside offer value and propose a more reasonable counteroffer.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\nGiven Player 1's offer is valued at 0 for me and my fallback is 139, I should not accept it. Instead, I should propose a counteroffer that gives me at least a value greater than 139. \n\n#### Proposed Counteroffer:\nLet's try to find a balance that appeases Player 1 while ensuring my total value is greater than 139. Attempting a few options:\n\n- My Proposal to Keep for Myself: [2, 1, 1, 2, 3]\n  - Calculating the Value: \n    - 2 \u00d7 10 (Item 1) + 1 \u00d7 59 (Item 2) + 1 \u00d7 13 (Item 3) + 2 \u00d7 35 (Item 4) + 3 \u00d7 52 (Item 5)\n    = 20 + 59 + 13 + 70 + 156 = 318\n\nThis exceeds my outside offer, so it's a feasible counteroffer, ensuring my payoff is above the outside offer value of 139.\n\n### Action\nProviding a reasonable offer that balances between both players' needs will reflect positively and potentially encourage Player 1 to consider a fair division.\n\nThus, my action is to make a counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 0, 0, 1, 2]}\n```\n\nThis counteroffer leaves Player 1 with [3, 0, 0, 1, 2], maximizing my value above the outside offer value and improving negotiation dynamics by potentially appealing to Player 1's valuation of these items.",

This is round 2, so the discount factor is 0.98^(2-1) = 0.98.\nThe discounted value of the offer is 347 * 0.98 = 340.06\n\nMy outside offer is 752. Since 340.06 is much less than 752, accepting the offer is not a good idea.\n\nNow I need to decide whether to walk away or make a counteroffer.\nIf I walk away, I get 752. If I make a counteroffer, there's a chance Player 2 will accept in round 3 (discounted by 0.98^2 = 0.9604), or they'll walk away.\n\nLet's consider making a counteroffer. I want to maximize my value. I have a total of 5 item 1s, 1 item 2, 1 item 3, 3 item 4s, and 5 item 5s.\nPlayer 2 offered me [3, 0, 0, 1, 2].

I know their values are between 1 and 101, so to be safe I'll assume that all of my items are more valuable to me than to them.\n\nLet's aim for a split that gives me a value greater than 752 after discounting it by one more round. This requires an un-discounted value of around 752/0.98 = 767.35.\n\nLet's try offering them [2, 0, 0, 1, 3]. That leaves me with [3, 1, 1, 2, 2].\nValue to me: (3 * 83) + (1 * 35) + (1 * 91) + (2 * 28) + (2 * 35) = 249 + 35 + 91 + 56 + 70 = 501\n\nThis isn't even close. Let's just ask for what is left over. \nCounteroffer: [2, 1, 1, 2, 3]. This is equivalent to asking Player 2 to accept the allocation from round one.\n\nValue to me: (3 * 83) + (0 * 35) + (0 * 91) + (1 * 28) + (2 * 35) = 249 + 0 + 0 + 28 + 70 = 347.\n\nStill not there. Okay, let's try an offer that leaves me at least 767.35 * 0.98 = 752.\n\nIf I give them 0 item 1s, 0 item 2s, 0 item 3s, 0 item 4s, and 0 item 5s.\n\nThe total value of my items to me is: (5 * 83) + (1 * 35) + (1 * 91) + (3 * 28) + (5 * 35) = 415 + 35 + 91 + 84 + 175 = 800.\n\nSo, this gives me an undicounted value of 800. That should definitely beat the walk away value. However, it is unlikely that player 2 will accept it. Let's offer a slightly less greedy deal.\nOffer [2, 0, 0, 1, 2].

Item 1 and 5 are relatively low value.\n\nSince I have no information about Player 2's preferences, a fair starting point might be to offer them roughly half of the most valuable items, while retaining a majority. Since there's no item 3, let's focus on offering a decent amount of item 2. I will offer player 2 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 4, and 1 unit of items 1 and 5.\n\nSo my offer will be [1, 3, 0, 2, 1]\n\nNow, let's construct the response in the correct format.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 3, 0, 2, 1]}\n```",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 187. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 187. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 744 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 0, 0, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    70 x 2 + 68 x 0 + 30 x 0 + 66 x 0 + 14 x 3\n    which is 182 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 187. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 0, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 3, 0, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Thus, choosing to accept it would result in a mistake (Mistake 4).\n\n#### Potential Counteroffers\n\nTo make a counteroffer, I need a combination that gives me a value greater than 741.\n\nNotice that keeping the items with higher values could be beneficial:\n\n- Full list of items available: [2, 4, 5, 7, 1]\n- Potentially valuable option: [0, 1, 2, 3, 0] (amounts for Player 1)\n\n- **My units if I offer [0, 1, 2, 3, 0]**:\n  - Item 1: 2 x 37 = 74\n  - Item 2: 3 x 76 = 228\n  - Item 3: 3 x 17 = 51\n  - Item 4: 4 x 94 = 376\n  - Item 5: 1 x 84 = 84\n\n**Total value if I keep [2, 3, 3, 4, 1]**: 74 + 228 + 51 + 376 + 84 = 813\n\nSince 813 is greater than my outside offer of 741, this is a valid counteroffer and avoids mistakes, ensuring my payoff is maximized as stated in my objectives.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nI should propose a counteroffer since the current offer is less than my outside offer, and I found a better alternative.\n\n**Action**:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 0]}\n```\nThis counteroffer guarantees a value of 813 for me by keeping [2, 3, 3, 4, 1] items, which is better than my outside offer.",

Since 123.48 < 139, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. I need to offer something that Player 2 is likely to accept, but also gives me a value greater than 139/0.98 = 141.84.\n\nPlayer 1 offered [1, 3, 3, 4, 0] initially. Player 2 countered with [0, 1, 2, 3, 0].\nLet's try to find a middle ground.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 2, 5, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    37 x 0 + 76 x 2 + 17 x 2 + 94 x 5 + 84 x 1\n    which is 740 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 741. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 3, 4, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 2, 3, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 3, 4, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 3, 4, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to consider my outside offer, which is 588. This is the minimum value I want to achieve in this negotiation. Since it's round 1, I have the most leverage. I will aim to make a counteroffer that is favorable to me but still potentially acceptable to Player 2.\n\nTo determine a reasonable counteroffer, I need to estimate the potential total value of the items to me and try to claim most of it. I have 7 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5. My values for these items are 58, 64, 29, 68, and 79, respectively. The total value of all items to me is (7 * 58) + (6 * 64) + (3 * 29) + (4 * 68) + (4 * 79) = 406 + 384 + 87 + 272 + 316 = 1465.\n\nSince I want to maximize my profit and I have the first move, I will make an offer that gives a small amount to the other player while keeping the majority of the items for myself. Let's start with an offer where I give the other player 1 unit of each item. That means Player 2 gets [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. My value would be:\n- Item 1: (7-1) * 58 = 6 * 58 = 348\n- Item 2: (6-1) * 64 = 5 * 64 = 320\n- Item 3: (3-1) * 29 = 2 * 29 = 58\n- Item 4: (4-1) * 68 = 3 * 68 = 204\n- Item 5: (4-1) * 79 = 3 * 79 = 237\nTotal value = 348 + 320 + 58 + 204 + 237 = 1167\n\nThis is significantly higher than my outside offer of 588. Let's try an even more aggressive counteroffer to see if Player 2 accepts. I'll give them only item 3, where my value is relatively low. Let's give Player 2 all 3 of item 3. My offer would be [0, 0, 3, 0, 0].\n- Item 1: 7 * 58 = 406\n- Item 2: 6 * 64 = 384\n- Item 3: 0 * 29 = 0\n- Item 4: 4 * 68 = 272\n- Item 5: 4 * 79 = 316\nTotal value = 406 + 384 + 0 + 272 + 316 = 1378\n\nSince this is still quite high, let's reduce to giving only 1 unit of item 3 and give them no other items. My offer would be [0, 0, 1, 0, 0].\n- Item 1: 7 * 58 = 406\n- Item 2: 6 * 64 = 384\n- Item 3: 2 * 29 = 58\n- Item 4: 4 * 68 = 272\n- Item 5: 4 * 79 = 316\nTotal value = 406 + 384 + 58 + 272 + 316 = 1436\n\nThis is still a good value, let's go with this offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [7, 6, 1, 2, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    61 x 7 + 48 x 6 + 6 x 1 + 73 x 2 + 53 x 4\n    which is 1079 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1080. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

It encourages me to consider making deals sooner rather than holding out too long without good reason.\n\nNext, let's assess the value of the current offer:\n\n1) Current offer to me: [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n   - Value if I accept it: 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 6 = 6\n\n2) Comparing the value of accepting the offer to my outside offer:\n   - Current offer value: 6\n   - Outside offer: 1080\n\nAccepting this offer is significantly worse than my outside offer.\n\n3) I should propose a counteroffer that maximizes my value. The goal is to avoid Mistake 2 (offering something worse than my outside offer), among others. Let's consider trying to keep the items with higher value:\n\nI will attempt to create an offer that maximizes my return:\n\n- Suppose I keep the maximum units of items 1, 2, 4, and 5 (all high-value items for me) and give away just enough units of other items to make a reasonable offer. Let's start by keeping all of item 1, 2, and 4 as they are high value, and I will give away items that don't affect my total much if it doesn't meet the outside offer; we can adjust:\n\n   Offer to Player 1: [0, 0, 2, 1, 0]\n   \n   - Value to me: \n     - Item 1: 7 x 61 = 427\n     - Item 2: 6 x 48 = 288\n     - Item 3: 1 x 6 = 6\n     - Item 4: 3 x 73 = 219\n     - Item 5: 4 x 53 = 212\n\n   Total value = 1152\n\nThis is higher than my outside offer, satisfying my objective.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [7, 6, 1, 2, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    61 x 7 + 48 x 6 + 6 x 1 + 73 x 2 + 53 x 4\n    which is 1079 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1080. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 2, 1, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "To decide, I'll evaluate the situation step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the current situation\n\n- **Outside Offer Value**: 1080\n- **Values of the Items**:\n  - Item 1: 61\n  - Item 2: 48\n  - Item 3: 6\n  - Item 4: 73\n  - Item 5: 53\n- **Total Pool of Items**:\n  - 7 units of item 1\n  - 6 units of item 2\n  - 3 units of item 3\n  - 4 units of item 4\n  - 4 units of item 5\n- **Discount Factor**: Gamma = 0.98\n\nThe discount factor influences the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers. Since we are in round 2, if we conclude now, the value is multiplied by gamma^1 = 0.98.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the value of offers\n\n- **Current Offer**: [0, 0, 1, 1, 0] (these are the items being offered to me)\n  - Value = (0 * 61) + (0 * 48) + (1 * 6) + (1 * 73) + (0 * 53)\n  - Value = 6 + 73 = 79\n  - Discounted Value in Round 2 = 79 * 0.98 = 77.42\n\nSince 77.42 is less than my outside offer of 1080, I should not accept this offer.\n\n- **Evaluate potential counteroffers**: I need to ensure that any counteroffer gives me a value greater than 1080.\n\nI'll consider an allocation that maximizes my value while leaving enough for Player 1.\n\nLet's start with the proposal where I keep almost everything and offer the least valuable to Player 1:\n\n- **Proposed Counteroffer**: [1, 2, 3, 2, 2] (offering Player 1 the rest)\n  - My items: [6, 4, 0, 2, 2]\n  - My Value = (6 * 61) + (4 * 48) + (0 * 6) + (2 * 73) + (2 * 53)\n  - My Value = 366 + 192 + 0 + 146 + 106 = 810\n\n810 is less than my outside offer value, so this counteroffer does not work. Let's try something else.\n\nProposed Factored Counteroffer: [0, 1, 3, 2, 1] (this is what I give to Player 1)\n  - My items: [7, 5, 0, 2, 3]\n  - My Value = (7 * 61) + (5 * 48) + (0 * 6) + (2 * 73) + (3 * 53)\n  - My Value = 427 + 240 + 0 + 146 + 159 = 972\n\nThis counteroffer still yields less than my outside offer as well. Let's adjust again.\n\nProposed Optimized Counteroffer: [0, 0, 3, 1, 1] \n  - My items: [7, 6, 0, 3, 3]\n  - My Value = (7 * 61) + (6 * 48) + (0 * 6) + (3 * 73) + (3 * 53)\n  - My Value = 427 + 288 + 0 + 219 + 159 = 1093\n\nNow, 1093 is greater than my outside offer value. Let's consider this my counteroffer, as it exceeds my outside offer while keeping a significant portion of the value.\n\n### Step 3: Decision\n\nGiven the analysis:\n\n- Do not accept the current offer as it provides a value (77.42) less than the outside offer (1080).\n- Prepare a counteroffer that provides me with a higher value than the outside offer.\n\nHence, I will propose the following counteroffer to Player 1:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 3, 1, 1]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 0, 2, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    81 x 1 + 50 x 0 + 26 x 0 + 54 x 2 + 80 x 0\n    which is 189 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 204. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 3, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 3, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "To determine my action, let's walk through the step-by-step analysis:\n\n### 1) Analyze the Current Situation:\n\n- **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 204.\n\n- **Values of the Items:**\n  - Item 1: 81 per unit\n  - Item 2: 50 per unit\n  - Item 3: 26 per unit\n  - Item 4: 54 per unit\n  - Item 5: 80 per unit\n\n- **Total Pool of Items:** \n  - Item 1: 3 units\n  - Item 2: 2 units\n  - Item 3: 7 units\n  - Item 4: 4 units\n  - Item 5: 4 units\n\n- **Discount Factor:** The discount factor is 0.98, influencing future offers by decreasing the value of the negotiation outcome if it is not settled in the current round.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n\n- **Current Offer:** [0, 0, 3, 1, 1]\n  - My Value Calculation:\n    - 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 81 = 0\n    - 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 50 = 0\n    - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78\n    - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 54 = 54\n    - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 80 = 80\n  - Total value of the current offer = 0 + 0 + 78 + 54 + 80 = 212\n\n- **Comparison to Outside Offer:**\n  - Current offer's value (212) is higher than my outside offer (204).\n\n### 3) Make a Decision:\n\n- **Decision Factors:**\n  - The current offer, valued at 212, is more advantageous than my outside offer of 204. \n  - The discount factor means future rounds likely won't have significantly better offers, as the value would decrease.\n\n- **Action:** I should accept the current offer since it's more favorable than my outside offer, preventing mistake 5 (walking away from an offer better than my outside offer) and taking into account the diminishing value in future rounds.\n\nGiven my analysis, my action is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",
