I don't know Player 2's values, so I will aim for a relatively even split, adjusting based on my own values. I'll offer Player 2 slightly more of items I value less and less of items I value more.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the items and quantities available:\n*   Item 1: 10 units, Value: 8\n*   Item 2: 2 units, Value: 17\n*   Item 3: 5 units, Value: 72\n*   Item 4: 3 units, Value: 71\n*   Item 5: 2 units, Value: 63\n\nI'll start with an offer close to half of each item to Player 2, then adjust slightly in my favor, prioritizing keeping items 3, 4 and 5.\n\n*   Item 1: Offer 5 to Player 2\n*   Item 2: Offer 1 to Player 2\n*   Item 3: Offer 2 to Player 2\n*   Item 4: Offer 1 to Player 2\n*   Item 5: Offer 1 to Player 2\n\nNow let's calculate the value of what I would keep:\n\n*   Item 1: 5 units * 8 = 40\n*   Item 2: 1 unit * 17 = 17\n*   Item 3: 3 units * 72 = 216\n*   Item 4: 2 units * 71 = 142\n*   Item 5: 1 unit * 63 = 63\n*   Total value: 40 + 17 + 216 + 142 + 63 = 478\n\nThis is greater than my outside offer of 436.

Let's consider a counteroffer that gives Player 2 slightly more, but still gives me a value higher than my outside offer.\n\nAvailable items:\n- Item 1: 10 total, I'm getting 3, so Player 2 has 7\n- Item 2: 2 total, I'm getting 2, so Player 2 has 0\n- Item 3: 5 total, I'm getting 3, so Player 2 has 2\n- Item 4: 3 total, I'm getting 2, so Player 2 has 1\n- Item 5: 2 total, I'm getting 0, so Player 2 has 2\n\nLet's see how a counteroffer where I take everything else works: [7, 0, 2, 1, 2] given to player 2\n\nMy take would be:\n- 10-7 = 3 of item 1 = 3 * 8 = 24\n- 2-0 = 2 of item 2 = 2 * 17 = 34\n- 5-2 = 3 of item 3 = 3 * 72 = 216\n- 3-1 = 2 of item 4 = 2 * 71 = 142\n- 2-2 = 0 of item 5 = 0 * 63 = 0\nValue: 24+34+216+142 = 416\nAdjusted Value: 416 * .9604 = 399.5264 which is still lower than my outside offer.\n\nBecause it is the last round and I would be walking away with 436 vs accepting an offer with adjusted value of 399.53. My best course of action is to walk away from the negotiations.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

This means I would get:\nItem 1: 1 unit\nItem 2: 3 units\nItem 3: 3 units\nItem 4: 4 units\nItem 5: 1 unit\n\nMy values for these items are: 41, 75, 9, 11, 61\n\nTherefore, the current offer's value to me is:\n(1 * 41) + (3 * 75) + (3 * 9) + (4 * 11) + (1 * 61) = 41 + 225 + 27 + 44 + 61 = 398\n\nSince it is round 2, the discount factor is 0.98^(2-1) = 0.98\n\nSo, the present value of this offer is 398 * 0.98 = 389.04\n\nMy outside offer is 639. Since 389.04 < 639, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. I need to offer something that Player 2 might accept, and that would be better for me than my outside option. It's difficult to know Player 2's valuation, but since my original offer in round 1 was [2, 0, 4, 7, 0] and Player 2 countered with [1, 3, 3, 4, 1], it suggests that Player 2 values item 2 and item 4 more than I do.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer that is slightly better for me than my outside option, after discounting. So I need to obtain at least 639/0.98=652.04 value.\n\nGiven the limited rounds and the unknown valuation of player 2, I will make a slightly more aggressive counteroffer than last round.\n\nHere's the logic for the counteroffer: I'll give the other player a good portion of Item 2 and Item 4, which they seem to value, and also give them some of Item 3 and Item 5.\n\nCounteroffer: offer player 2 the allocation [1, 1, 3, 5, 1]. Which means that I would get:\nItem 1: 2 units\nItem 2: 3 units\nItem 3: 2 units\nItem 4: 4 units\nItem 5: 1 unit\n\nMy values: 41, 75, 9, 11, 61\nMy total value = (2*41) + (3*75) + (2*9) + (4*11) + (1*61) = 82 + 225 + 18 + 44 + 61 = 430\nDiscounted value = 430*0.98 = 421.4 which is still below my outside option.\n\nTo obtain at least 652.04 value:\nI need to receive at least: 652.04/0.98 = 665.35 value, which means 665.35 = n1*41 + n2*75 + n3*9 + n4*11 + n5*61\nI must offer player 2 at max: [3-n1, 4-n2, 5-n3, 9-n4, 2-n5]\n\nThe best I can do is WALK.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

My goal is to maximize my discounted value, taking into account my outside offer of 1231.\n\nSince I'm going first, I need to make an offer. I want to offer Player 2 just enough to make them accept, while maximizing my own value. To do this, I need to estimate their potential value for the items. Since their values are drawn from a uniform distribution between 1 and 101, I can assume their average value for each item is roughly 51. I need to offer them enough to beat their outside offer, which is unknown, but could be potentially high. Since it is round 1, I should try to make a fair offer and see if they accept.\n\nHere's my breakdown of items and their values to me:\nItem 1: 5 units, value 6 each. Total Value: 30\nItem 2: 7 units, value 80 each. Total Value: 560\nItem 3: 6 units, value 26 each. Total Value: 156\nItem 4: 5 units, value 58 each. Total Value: 290\nItem 5: 6 units, value 36 each. Total Value: 216\nTotal Value: 1252\n\nA fair starting point would be to split the items roughly in half based on quantity. Let's consider this division:\n\nItem 1: Give 2 to Player 2, keep 3. Value to me: 3 * 6 = 18\nItem 2: Give 3 to Player 2, keep 4. Value to me: 4 * 80 = 320\nItem 3: Give 3 to Player 2, keep 3. Value to me: 3 * 26 = 78\nItem 4: Give 2 to Player 2, keep 3. Value to me: 3 * 58 = 174\nItem 5: Give 3 to Player 2, keep 3. Value to me: 3 * 36 = 108\nTotal Value to me: 18 + 320 + 78 + 174 + 108 = 698\n\nThis is less than my outside offer of 1231. I need to offer less to Player 2.\n\nLet's try giving more items to myself:\n\nItem 1: Give 1 to Player 2, keep 4. Value to me: 4 * 6 = 24\nItem 2: Give 2 to Player 2, keep 5. Value to me: 5 * 80 = 400\nItem 3: Give 2 to Player 2, keep 4. Value to me: 4 * 26 = 104\nItem 4: Give 1 to Player 2, keep 4. Value to me: 4 * 58 = 232\nItem 5: Give 2 to Player 2, keep 4. Value to me: 4 * 36 = 144\nTotal Value to me: 24 + 400 + 104 + 232 + 144 = 904\n\nThis is still less than my outside offer of 1231.\n\nLet's try an offer that leaves me with a total value near my outside option, but is still somewhat reasonable for the other player so they don't walk away immediately.\n\nItem 1: Give 1 to Player 2, keep 4. Value to me: 4*6 = 24\nItem 2: Give 1 to Player 2, keep 6. Value to me: 6*80 = 480\nItem 3: Give 1 to Player 2, keep 5. Value to me: 5*26 = 130\nItem 4: Give 1 to Player 2, keep 4. Value to me: 4*58 = 232\nItem 5: Give 1 to Player 2, keep 5. Value to me: 5*36 = 180\nTotal Value: 24 + 480 + 130 + 232 + 180 = 1046\n\nStill too low, let's try again:\n\nItem 1: Give 0 to Player 2, keep 5. Value to me: 5*6 = 30\nItem 2: Give 0 to Player 2, keep 7. Value to me: 7*80 = 560\nItem 3: Give 1 to Player 2, keep 5. Value to me: 5*26 = 130\nItem 4: Give 0 to Player 2, keep 5. Value to me: 5*58 = 290\nItem 5: Give 1 to Player 2, keep 5.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 270. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player2, 2 units of each item (keeping 1 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 375 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 3, 0, 1, 4]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 4, 0, 0, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 4, 0, 0, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

Player 2 is offering me [2, 4, 0, 0, 3] units of items 1 through 5, respectively.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the value of this offer to me:\n- 2 units of item 1: 2 * 19 = 38\n- 4 units of item 2: 4 * 22 = 88\n- 0 units of item 3: 0 * 22 = 0\n- 0 units of item 4: 0 * 47 = 0\n- 3 units of item 5: 3 * 15 = 45\nTotal value of the offer = 38 + 88 + 0 + 0 + 45 = 171\n\nNow, I need to consider the discount factor. This is round 2, so the discount factor is 0.98^(2-1) = 0.98.\nPresent value of the offer = 171 * 0.98 = 167.58\n\nMy outside offer is 270. Since 167.58 < 270, accepting this offer would be worse than walking away.\n\nNow, I need to consider making a counteroffer. I will aim to get a deal that is better than my outside option of 270, accounting for the discount factor. Since it is round 2, the target value that the offer needs to reach to exceed walking away is target_value= 270/0.98 =  275.51.\n\nLet's try to construct a counteroffer that gives Player 2 just enough value to make them accept, while maximizing my value. I don't know Player 2's valuation, so I'll make a reasonable counteroffer and hope they accept it.\n\nI will make a counteroffer where I offer Player 2 [1, 3, 0, 1, 3]. This means I keep [3, 4, 1, 2, 5].\nMy valuation of what I keep is 3*19 + 4*22 + 1*22 + 2*47 + 5*15 = 57 + 88 + 22 + 94 + 75 = 336\nDiscounted Value = 336 * 0.98 = 329.28.

Since 246.8228 < 270, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. Since this is the final round, if I make a counteroffer, it will be treated as a walk if Player 2 doesn't like it. Therefore, it's extremely important to make an offer that is likely to be accepted by Player 2.\n\nLet's consider offering Player 2 everything that I don't value highly. The current resources are:\nItem 1: 4\nItem 2: 7\nItem 3: 1\nItem 4: 3\nItem 5: 8\n\nThe current offer to me is [3, 5, 0, 0, 6].

This is > 270.\n\nLet's try offering the minimum to Player 2 such that my discounted value exceeds my outside offer. Let me construct an offer such that accepting it gives a higher discounted return than walking away.\n\nSince walking gives 270, and the discount factor is 0.9604, I need to receive items that sum to 270/0.9604=281.13286.\nLet's propose an offer to Player 2 of [0, 1, 0, 0, 1].\nThen I keep 4,6,1,3,7.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 797. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player2, 2 units of each item (keeping 1 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 753 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\nMy values are:\n- Item 1: 64 (3 units)\n- Item 2: 15 (1 unit)\n- Item 3: 67 (3 units)\n- Item 4: 93 (5 units)\n- Item 5: 12 (5 units)\nMy outside offer is 797.\n\nSince this is the first round and I'm player 1, I need to make an initial offer. I want to maximize my outcome, considering the possibility of future rounds and the discount factor. A good strategy is to make an offer that is slightly better than the other player's potential outside option, which I don't know. However, I can assume Player 2's values are also randomly distributed from 1 to 101, similar to my own.\n\nSince I don't know Player 2's values, I'll start with a relatively fair offer, giving Player 2 a substantial portion of the items, but still keeping a good amount for myself to exceed my outside offer. My strategy is to concede more items I value less.\n\nLet's try offering Player 2:\n- Item 1: 1 unit (leaving me with 2 units)\n- Item 2: 0 unit (leaving me with 1 unit)\n- Item 3: 1 unit (leaving me with 2 units)\n- Item 4: 2 units (leaving me with 3 units)\n- Item 5: 2 units (leaving me with 3 units)\n\nThis gives Player 2 a total value of (assuming their values are about the same as mine):\n1 * 64 + 0 * 15 + 1 * 67 + 2 * 93 + 2 * 12 = 64 + 0 + 67 + 186 + 24 = 341\n\nMy value would be:\n2 * 64 + 1 * 15 + 2 * 67 + 3 * 93 + 3 * 12 = 128 + 15 + 134 + 279 + 36 = 592\n\nThis offer seems a bit skewed towards me. I need to offer more, while still maximizing my gain over my outside offer. Let's try this offer instead:\n\n- Item 1: 1 unit (leaving me with 2 units)\n- Item 2: 0 unit (leaving me with 1 unit)\n- Item 3: 1 unit (leaving me with 2 units)\n- Item 4: 3 units (leaving me with 2 units)\n- Item 5: 3 units (leaving me with 2 units)\n\nThis gives Player 2 a total value of:\n1 * 64 + 0 * 15 + 1 * 67 + 3 * 93 + 3 * 12 = 64 + 0 + 67 + 279 + 36 = 446\n\nMy value would be:\n2 * 64 + 1 * 15 + 2 * 67 + 2 * 93 + 2 * 12 = 128 + 15 + 134 + 186 + 24 = 487\n\nThis value is not enough. I am better off walking away from the negotiation.\n\nLet's try offering Player 2:\n- Item 1: 0 units (leaving me with 3 units)\n- Item 2: 0 units (leaving me with 1 unit)\n- Item 3: 0 units (leaving me with 3 units)\n- Item 4: 3 units (leaving me with 2 units)\n- Item 5: 3 units (leaving me with 2 units)\n\nThis gives Player 2 a total value of:\n0 * 64 + 0 * 15 + 0 * 67 + 3 * 93 + 3 * 12 = 0 + 0 + 0 + 279 + 36 = 315\n\nMy value would be:\n3 * 64 + 1 * 15 + 3 * 67 + 2 * 93 + 2 * 12 = 192 + 15 + 201 + 186 + 24 = 618\n\nLet's try offering Player 2:\n- Item 1: 0 units (leaving me with 3 units)\n- Item 2: 0 units (leaving me with 1 unit)\n- Item 3: 0 units (leaving me with 3 units)\n- Item 4: 2 units (leaving me with 3 units)\n- Item 5: 3 units (leaving me with 2 units)\n\nThis gives Player 2 a total value of:\n0 * 64 + 0 * 15 + 0 * 67 + 2 * 93 + 3 * 12 = 0 + 0 + 0 + 186 + 36 = 222\n\nMy value would be:\n3 * 64 + 1 * 15 + 3 * 67 + 3 * 93 + 2 * 12 = 192 + 15 + 201 + 279 + 24 = 711\n\nLet's try offering Player 2:\n- Item 1: 1 unit (leaving me with 2 units)\n- Item 2: 0 units (leaving me with 1 unit)\n- Item 3: 1 unit (leaving me with 2 units)\n- Item 4: 3 units (leaving me with 2 units)\n- Item 5: 2 units (leaving me with 3 units)\n\nThis gives Player 2 a total value of:\n1 * 64 + 0 * 15 + 1 * 67 + 3 * 93 + 2 * 12 = 64 + 0 + 67 + 279 + 24 = 434\n\nMy value would be:\n2 * 64 + 1 * 15 + 2 * 67 + 2 * 93 + 3 * 12 = 128 + 15 + 134 + 186 + 36 = 499\n\nIt seems hard to exceed 797 with a reasonable offer to Player 2. Considering the discount factor in later rounds, I should be willing to give Player 2 more in the first round. Let's try this offer:\n- Item 1: 1\n- Item 2: 0\n- Item 3: 1\n- Item 4: 4\n- Item 5: 4\nPlayer 2's value: 64 + 67 + 4*93 + 4*12 = 64 + 67 + 372 + 48 = 551\nMy Value: 2*64 + 15 + 2*67 + 93 + 12 = 128 + 15 + 134 + 93 + 12 = 382\n\nI think my best approach is to walk away, since it seems hard to get a better deal than my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to consider my outside offer, which is 699. This is my guaranteed fallback. Any offer I accept must be worth more than this, considering the discount factor.\n\nSince this is the first round, I have no offer to accept. I need to make a counteroffer. To do this effectively, I need to estimate what Player 2 might value the items at, and what their outside offer might be. Without any information, I should aim for an equal split of the surplus above my outside offer.\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\n1.  **Total Value of Items:** 2\\*31 + 7\\*78 + 3\\*77 + 3\\*58 + 2\\*18 = 62 + 546 + 231 + 174 + 36 = 1049\n\n2.  **Fair Division:** I want to find a deal that gives me more than 699, my outside offer. To begin, let's try for a close to equal split of all the items, taking into account the amounts available. I'll start with splitting as closely as possible:\n\n    *   Item 1: Give 1 to Player 2, keep 1.\n    *   Item 2: Give 3 to Player 2, keep 4.\n    *   Item 3: Give 1 to Player 2, keep 2.\n    *   Item 4: Give 1 to Player 2, keep 2.\n    *   Item 5: Give 1 to Player 2, keep 1.\n\n3.  **Value to Me:**  My value for this split: 1\\*31 + 4\\*78 + 2\\*77 + 2\\*58 + 1\\*18 = 31 + 312 + 154 + 116 + 18 = 631\n\n    This is less than my outside offer of 699, so this offer to player 2 is not acceptable.\n\n4. I will adjust the offer to player 2 until my value after the split exceeds my outside offer.\n\n    *   Item 1: Give 0 to Player 2, keep 2.\n    *   Item 2: Give 3 to Player 2, keep 4.\n    *   Item 3: Give 1 to Player 2, keep 2.\n    *   Item 4: Give 1 to Player 2, keep 2.\n    *   Item 5: Give 1 to Player 2, keep 1.\n\n    *Value to Me:* 2\\*31 + 4\\*78 + 2\\*77 + 2\\*58 + 1\\*18 = 62 + 312 + 154 + 116 + 18 = 662\n\n    Still less than my outside offer of 699, so this offer to player 2 is not acceptable.\n\n    *   Item 1: Give 0 to Player 2, keep 2.\n    *   Item 2: Give 2 to Player 2, keep 5.\n    *   Item 3: Give 1 to Player 2, keep 2.\n    *   Item 4: Give 1 to Player 2, keep 2.\n    *   Item 5: Give 1 to Player 2, keep 1.\n\n    *Value to Me:* 2\\*31 + 5\\*78 + 2\\*77 + 2\\*58 + 1\\*18 = 62 + 390 + 154 + 116 + 18 = 740\n\n    This is more than my outside offer of 699, so this is an acceptable offer to consider.\n\n5.

It's round 2, and I need to decide whether to accept Player 2's offer, walk away, or make a counteroffer.\n\nFirst, I'll evaluate the current offer on the table: [0, 6, 0, 2, 0]. This means I get 0 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n\nMy values for each item are: 31 (item 1), 78 (item 2), 77 (item 3), 58 (item 4), 18 (item 5).\n\nSo, the value of the current offer to me is:\n(0 * 31) + (6 * 78) + (0 * 77) + (2 * 58) + (0 * 18) = 0 + 468 + 0 + 116 + 0 = 584\n\nNow, I need to consider the discount factor. Since it's round 2, the discount factor is 0.98^(2-1) = 0.98.\n\nThe discounted value of the current offer is 584 * 0.98 = 572.32\n\nMy outside offer is 699. Since the discounted value of the current offer (572.32) is less than my outside offer (699), accepting the offer is not optimal.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. The goal is to reach a deal that's better than walking away (699) for both players. I want to maximize my own value, considering Player 2's likely responses. It's tough to know Player 2's values, but I can try to make a reasonable offer and hope they accept it.\n\nI have the following items to distribute:\nItem 1: 2 units\nItem 2: 7 units\nItem 3: 3 units\nItem 4: 3 units\nItem 5: 2 units\n\nPlayer 2's offer was [0, 6, 0, 2, 0], and my initial offer was [0, 2, 1, 1, 1]. We seem to value item 2 differently, and Player 2 values items 3 and 5 lower.\n\nI will try to get more of Item 3 and Item 5, while still trying to give value to Player 2 in Item 2 and Item 4, as well as Item 1.\n\nHere's a counteroffer that gives Player 2: [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]\nThis leaves me with:\nItem 1: 1 unit\nItem 2: 6 units\nItem 3: 3 units\nItem 4: 2 units\nItem 5: 2 units\n\nMy value from this: (1 * 31) + (6 * 78) + (3 * 77) + (2 * 58) + (2 * 18) = 31 + 468 + 231 + 116 + 36 = 882\n\nDiscounted value for me: 882 * 0.98 = 864.36\n\nSince 864.36 > 699, this offer is better than walking away for me if accepted. Now, let's hope it is good enough for Player 2.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]}\n```",

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 1, 0, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [6, 1, 1, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [6, 1, 1, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\nThe current offer on the table gives me:\n- 6 units of item 1: 6 * 78 = 468\n- 1 unit of item 2: 1 * 6 = 6\n- 1 unit of item 3: 1 * 28 = 28\n- 2 units of item 4: 2 * 30 = 60\n- 1 unit of item 5: 1 * 27 = 27\nTotal value of the current offer: 468 + 6 + 28 + 60 + 27 = 589\n\nMy outside offer is 617. Since 589 < 617, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider a counteroffer. I need to offer something that Player 2 is likely to accept and that gives me a value greater than 617. I have:\n- 9 units of item 1\n- 4 units of item 2\n- 1 unit of item 3\n- 2 units of item 4\n- 5 units of item 5\n\nPlayer 2's offer in round 1 was [6, 1, 1, 2, 1]. This means they wanted 6 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5. I countered by offering [3, 1, 0, 0, 1].\n\nLet's try offering Player 2 slightly less than their round 1 offer but more generous than my round 1 offer. I could offer them [5, 1, 1, 1, 1]. This gives me:\n- 4 units of item 1: 4 * 78 = 312\n- 3 units of item 2: 3 * 6 = 18\n- 0 units of item 3: 0 * 28 = 0\n- 1 unit of item 4: 1 * 30 = 30\n- 4 units of item 5: 4 * 27 = 108\nTotal value: 312 + 18 + 0 + 30 + 108 = 468\n\nIf the counteroffer is accepted, the value will be multiplied by 0.98. 468 * 0.98 = 458.64 which is smaller than my outside offer. This suggests that the counteroffer is not good enough.\n\nInstead, let me try to get closer to my outside offer. I should try a more aggressive counteroffer.\nLet's offer Player 2: [2, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This keeps everything for myself except those 2 units of item 1. The value will be:\n- 7 units of item 1: 7 * 78 = 546\n- 4 units of item 2: 4 * 6 = 24\n- 1 unit of item 3: 1 * 28 = 28\n- 2 units of item 4: 2 * 30 = 60\n- 5 units of item 5: 5 * 27 = 135\nTotal value: 546 + 24 + 28 + 60 + 135 = 793\n793 * 0.98 = 777.14 > 617\n\nThis may be too risky as Player 2 may walk away. Let's try something in between to maximize my chance of getting it accepted.\nI'll try offering player 2 [4, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n\nThen I will get:\n- 5 units of item 1: 5 * 78 = 390\n- 3 units of item 2: 3 * 6 = 18\n- 1 unit of item 3: 1 * 28 = 28\n- 1 unit of item 4: 1 * 30 = 30\n- 4 units of item 5: 4 * 27 = 108\nTotal value: 390 + 18 + 28 + 30 + 108 = 574\n574 * 0.98 = 562.52 < 617\n\nI will walk away and take my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 1, 1, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 2, 0, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 2, 0, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. It's round 2. Player 1 (myself) offered [1, 0, 1, 1, 3] in round 1, meaning I offered Player 2 1 unit of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 3 units of item 5. Player 2 countered with [1, 0, 2, 0, 2], meaning they are offering me 1 unit of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5. My outside offer is 5. The discount factor is 0.98.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the current offer to me:\n- Item 1: 1 unit * 57 = 57\n- Item 2: 0 units * 22 = 0\n- Item 3: 2 units * 39 = 78\n- Item 4: 0 units * 33 = 0\n- Item 5: 2 units * 9 = 18\nTotal value = 57 + 0 + 78 + 0 + 18 = 153\n\nSince it is round 2, we need to discount this value by gamma^(2-1) = 0.98^1 = 0.98.\nDiscounted value = 153 * 0.98 = 149.94\n\nSince 149.94 is significantly greater than my outside offer of 5, I should accept this offer unless I believe I can get significantly more value by making a counteroffer that Player 2 will accept. It's unlikely they will agree to something that gives me much more value.\n\nLet's consider making a counteroffer that gives me more. The total available items are 1 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 5 of item 5. The current offer means I get [1, 0, 2, 0, 2]. Therefore, Player 2 currently has [0, 0, 0, 2, 3]. I could try to offer Player 2 less, for example, [0, 0, 1, 0, 1]. That would give me [1, 0, 1, 2, 4], which has a value of (57 * 1) + (22 * 0) + (39 * 1) + (33 * 2) + (9 * 4) = 57 + 0 + 39 + 66 + 36 = 198. The discounted value is 198 * 0.98 = 194.04. However, there's no guarantee Player 2 will accept this counteroffer, and if they don't, I'll be forced to WALK in round 3. Given the relatively small possible increase in value, it's not worth the risk.\n\nTherefore, the best action is to ACCEPT the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's start by outlining my strategy. I want to maximize my expected value, considering my private values and outside option. Given the three rounds and the discount factor, it's generally advantageous to reach an agreement if possible. Since this is the first round, I need to make an initial offer. I will make a generous offer to increase the chances of an early agreement, but not so generous that I am worse off than my outside offer.\n\nMy private values are:\n- Item 1: 44\n- Item 2: 68\n- Item 3: 18\n- Item 4: 36\n- Item 5: 43\n\nTotal items available:\n- Item 1: 8\n- Item 2: 0\n- Item 3: 0\n- Item 4: 6\n- Item 5: 5\n\nMy total value for all items: (8 * 44) + (0 * 68) + (0 * 18) + (6 * 36) + (5 * 43) = 352 + 0 + 0 + 216 + 215 = 783\nMy outside offer: 587\n\nI will start by offering Player 2 slightly more than half of the total value, while still guaranteeing myself more than my outside option. I'll keep about 450 worth of items for myself, meaning I need to offer Player 2 roughly 783-450 = 333 worth of items. I will try to give items that I value less to the other player. I will give all the items 2 and 3 as I value them low.\n\nI will give Player 2:\n- 3 units of Item 1: 3 * 44 = 132\n- 0 units of Item 2: 0 * 68 = 0\n- 0 units of Item 3: 0 * 18 = 0\n- 3 units of Item 4: 3 * 36 = 108\n- 2 units of Item 5: 2 * 43 = 86\n\nTotal value offered = 132 + 0 + 0 + 108 + 86 = 326\nThe value of the items I keep = (5 * 44) + (0 * 68) + (0 * 18) + (3 * 36) + (3 * 43) = 220 + 0 + 0 + 108 + 129 = 457\n\nThis ensures that I receive a value of 457, which is below my outside option.

This is slightly lower from original offer to see if I can get some of the items back for better value\n*   This would leave me with: item1=6, item2=0, item3=0, item4=4, item5=4\n    *   6 units of item 1: 6 * 44 = 264\n    *   0 units of item 2: 0 * 68 = 0\n    *   0 units of item 3: 0 * 18 = 0\n    *   4 units of item 4: 4 * 36 = 144\n    *   4 units of item 5: 4 * 43 = 172\n    *   Total value: 264 + 0 + 0 + 144 + 172 = 580\n    *   discounted total value: 580*0.98 = 568.4. This isn't that much worse then my outside option.\n\nBased on the above analysis, I will make a counteroffer. I am now making a counteroffer\n*   Offer to Player 2: [2, 0, 0, 2, 1]. This would leave me with: item1=6, item2=0, item3=0, item4=4, item5=4, this has a value of 568.4, which isn't that much worse then my outside option.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 0, 2, 1]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's start by outlining my strategy. I want to maximize my discounted value, taking into account my outside offer of 1072. Since it's the first round, I'll make an offer that gives Player 2 just enough to be better than their *presumed* outside offer (without knowing it). I will assume that Player 2's values are similar to mine, but not exactly. Thus I will try to get them to take a deal that favors me slightly but that will seem attractive to them.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total value of all items if I kept them:\nItem 1: 2 * 56 = 112\nItem 2: 3 * 17 = 51\nItem 3: 6 * 64 = 384\nItem 4: 5 * 66 = 330\nItem 5: 3 * 90 = 270\nTotal Value: 112 + 51 + 384 + 330 + 270 = 1147\n\nI want to keep at least 1072 value for myself (my outside offer).\n\nLet's start by offering Player 2 relatively small quantities of each item.\nOffer: [1, 1, 3, 2, 1]\nValue to Player 2 (unknown to me):  Assuming that Player 2's values are around mine, this would amount to an ok amount to them. It leaves me with:\nItem 1: 1 * 56 = 56\nItem 2: 2 * 17 = 34\nItem 3: 3 * 64 = 192\nItem 4: 3 * 66 = 198\nItem 5: 2 * 90 = 180\nTotal Value: 56 + 34 + 192 + 198 + 180 = 660\nThis is not enough.\n\nLet me try a different approach. What offer guarantees that I get at least 1072 if Player 2 accepts? Nothing. So let's try to get as much as possible while still giving Player 2 something.\n\nHow about offer [0,0,0,0,0]?\nMy value would be 1147. Good, but risky.\n\nOkay, let's try giving player 2 items that I value less, and keeping items that I value more.\nOffer: [0, 2, 3, 2, 0]\nMy value:\nItem 1: 2 * 56 = 112\nItem 2: 1 * 17 = 17\nItem 3: 3 * 64 = 192\nItem 4: 3 * 66 = 198\nItem 5: 3 * 90 = 270\nTotal value = 112+17+192+198+270 = 789\nNot good enough.\n\nLet's give Player 2 more of Item 2 and 4, since they have lower value to me. And less of the other items.\n\nOffer: [0,3,3,3,0]\nMy Value:\nItem 1: 2 * 56 = 112\nItem 2: 0 * 17 = 0\nItem 3: 3 * 64 = 192\nItem 4: 2 * 66 = 132\nItem 5: 3 * 90 = 270\nTotal Value = 112 + 0 + 192 + 132 + 270 = 706. That's still not enough. I'd rather take my outside offer.\n\nI need to make a more aggressive offer to keep more value. Let's try offering slightly less than half to Player 2.\n\nOffer: [1, 1, 3, 2, 1]\nMy value:\nItem 1: 1 * 56 = 56\nItem 2: 2 * 17 = 34\nItem 3: 3 * 64 = 192\nItem 4: 3 * 66 = 198\nItem 5: 2 * 90 = 180\nTotal Value = 56 + 34 + 192 + 198 + 180 = 660. Still below my threshold.\n\nLet's make an offer that yields a value close to my outside offer:\nOffer [0, 1, 2, 1, 0]\nMy value:\nItem 1: 2 * 56 = 112\nItem 2: 2 * 17 = 34\nItem 3: 4 * 64 = 256\nItem 4: 4 * 66 = 264\nItem 5: 3 * 90 = 270\nTotal value: 112 + 34 + 256 + 264 + 270 = 936. Still not enough.\n\nOffer: [0,0,1,0,0]\nMy value:\nItem 1: 2 * 56 = 112\nItem 2: 3 * 17 = 51\nItem 3: 5 * 64 = 320\nItem 4: 5 * 66 = 330\nItem 5: 3 * 90 = 270\nTotal Value = 112+51+320+330+270=1083\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]}\n",

My private values are 29, 50, 59, 47, and 21. My outside offer is 97. The discount factor is 0.98.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the value of the current offer:\n1 * 29 + 4 * 50 + 6 * 59 + 0 * 47 + 2 * 21 = 29 + 200 + 354 + 0 + 42 = 625.\nSince it's round 2, I need to discount this value by 0.98^(2-1) = 0.98.\nSo, the present value of the offer is 625 * 0.98 = 612.5.\nThis is much greater than my outside offer of 97.\n\nNow I need to consider what counteroffer to make, if any. Since the current offer is so good, I should strongly consider accepting it. However, I will still explore if I can make a better deal for myself by making a counteroffer. Let's try to figure out what a reasonable counteroffer could be. I will see if offering player 2 half of what I have is a reasonable option, while still remaining above my outside offer.\n\nIf I give player 2 [2, 3, 3, 1, 3], what would I get? I would have [2, 4, 4, 1, 4].\nValue to me would be:\n2 * 29 + 4 * 50 + 4 * 59 + 1 * 47 + 4 * 21 = 58 + 200 + 236 + 47 + 84 = 625.\nDiscounted, this is 625 * 0.98 = 612.5\n\nAlternatively, I will evaluate a counteroffer that is only slightly better than the current offer to Player 2, and see if I get a better deal than accepting.\nConsider offering player 2 [0, 3, 5, 0, 1]. In that case, I will have [4, 4, 2, 2, 6]. The value to me will be:\n4 * 29 + 4 * 50 + 2 * 59 + 2 * 47 + 6 * 21 = 116 + 200 + 118 + 94 + 126 = 654. Discounted, the value is 654 * 0.98 = 640.92\n\nHowever, it's round 2, so I have a good offer on the table already. The counteroffer does yield a higher value, but it is unclear what player 2's values are, and so I am not sure they will accept. The risks of them walking is too great.

I should keep items with high value to me and offer more of the lower-value items to Player 1.\n\nMy item values from highest to lowest:\n- Item 5: 91 (I want to keep most of the 3 units)\n- Item 4: 90 (I want to keep most of the 3 units)\n- Item 1: 87 (I want to keep most of the 2 units)\n- Item 2: 76 (Medium value, I can be more flexible)\n- Item 3: 29 (Lowest value, can offer more to Player 1)\n\nLet me prepare a counteroffer where I give Player 1:\n- Item 1: 0 units (keeping both high-value units)\n- Item 2: 3 units (sharing the 5 units)\n- Item 3: 2 units (giving both low-value units)\n- Item 4: 1 unit (keeping most of this high-value item)\n- Item 5: 1 unit (keeping most of this high-value item)\n\nThis counteroffer would give me a value of: 2\u00d787 + 2\u00d776 + 0\u00d729 + 2\u00d790 + 2\u00d791 = 174 + 152 + 0 + 180 + 182 = 688\n\nWhile this is slightly less than the current offer (706), I'm making a strategic initial counteroffer to establish my preferences. I expect we'll need to negotiate further.\n\nActually, upon reflection, I should aim for a better outcome than the current offer. Let me revise:\n\n- Item 1: 1 unit (share the high-value units)\n- Item 2: 2 units (giving less than half)\n- Item 3: 2 units (giving both low-value units)\n- Item 4: 1 unit (keeping most of this high-value item)\n- Item 5: 1 unit (keeping most of this high-value item)\n\nThis would give me: 1\u00d787 + 3\u00d776 + 0\u00d729 + 2\u00d790 + 2\u00d791 = 87 + 228 + 0 + 180 + 182 = 677\n\nStill slightly worse than the current offer.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 4, 0, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 1, 4, 0, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 1, 4, 0, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\nThe current offer gives me:\n- 3 units of item 1\n- 1 unit of item 2\n- 4 units of item 3\n- 0 units of item 4\n- 3 units of item 5\n\nMy private values are:\n- Item 1: 75\n- Item 2: 8\n- Item 3: 1\n- Item 4: 63\n- Item 5: 97\n\nSo the value of the current offer to me is:\n(3 * 75) + (1 * 8) + (4 * 1) + (0 * 63) + (3 * 97) = 225 + 8 + 4 + 0 + 291 = 528\n\nSince it is round 2, the discount factor is 0.98^(2-1) = 0.98.\nThe present value of accepting the current offer is 528 * 0.98 = 517.44.\n\nMy outside offer is 183. Since 517.44 > 183, I should not walk away.\n\nNow, let's consider a counteroffer. I want to maximize my value, so I want to keep as many of the high-value items (1, 4, and 5) as possible. Let's consider offering the other player half of my high value items to see if they accept, or it could get me a higher value than my current situation.\n\nIf I offer the following to player 2:\nItem 1: 3\nItem 2: 1\nItem 3: 4\nItem 4: 0\nItem 5: 3\nThis would be accepting the existing offer from player 2. If I did not accept it this round, then player 2 could lower their counteroffer and I could receive less value.\n\nSince 517.44 is significantly better than my outside offer of 183, I should accept the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

A naive approach would be to split everything evenly. However, this might not be optimal. I should try to keep items that I value highly and offer more of items that I value less.\n\nLet's consider offering Player 2 half of each item.
