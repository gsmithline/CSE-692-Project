Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 474. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 474. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 891 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 5, 2, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    52 x 0 + 79 x 1 + 78 x 5 + 2 x 2 + 86 x 0\n    which is 473 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 474. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Let's break down the situation step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer value is 474.\n- **Values of the Items**:\n  - Item 1: 52\n  - Item 2: 79\n  - Item 3: 78\n  - Item 4: 2\n  - Item 5: 86\n- **Total Pool of Items**:\n  - Item 1: 4 units\n  - Item 2: 3 units\n  - Item 3: 5 units\n  - Item 4: 5 units\n  - Item 5: 3 units\n- **Discount Factor**: The discount factor (gamma) influences the value of the deal depending on when it's accepted. The longer the negotiation, the more the value decreases for each player.\n  - Round 1: No discount\n  - Round 2: 0.98 times the value\n  - Round 3 (if it gets that far): 0.98\u00b2 times the value\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\nAs there is no current offer to me, I need to think about my initial offer or whether to walk away.\n\n#### Value Calculation for Proposed Offers:\n1. **Example Offer [1, 1, 3, 2, 1]**:\n   - This means offering Player 2: 3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n   - My remaining units: [1, 1, 3, 2, 1]\n   - My value:\n     - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 52 = 52\n     - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 79 = 79\n     - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234\n     - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 2 = 4\n     - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 86 = 86\n   - Total value = 52 + 79 + 234 + 4 + 86 = 455\n\n455 is less than my outside offer value of 474, so I should not make this offer.\n\n2. **Example Offer [2, 1, 3, 5, 2]**:\n   - Offering Player 2: 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5.\n   - My remaining units: [2, 2, 3, 5, 2]\n   - My value:\n     - 2 unit of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 52 = 104\n     - 2 unit of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 79 = 158\n     - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234\n     - 5 units of item 4 = 5 \u00d7 2 = 10\n     - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 86 = 172\n   - Total value = 104 + 158 + 234 + 10 + 172 = 678\n\n678 is greater than my outside offer of 474.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nBased on the above calculation, it is clear that the offer [2, 1, 3, 0, 1] results in a value (678) higher than my outside offer (474). Therefore, I should propose this counteroffer to begin the negotiation process. \n\nThis offer aligns with avoiding the five common negotiation mistakes: it's better than my outside offer, I'm not giving away all items, and if Player 2 rejects it, I still have the chance to make further concessions.\n\nSo, my action is to make a counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 3, 0, 1]}\n```",

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "To determine my best action, I'll break down the situation step by step:\n\n1) **Analyze the Current Situation**\n\n   - **Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer value is 335. This is the value I will receive if I choose to walk away from this negotiation.\n   \n   - **Values of the Items**: \n     - Item 1: 30 per unit\n     - Item 2: 12 per unit\n     - Item 3: 1 per unit\n     - Item 4: 47 per unit\n     - Item 5: 32 per unit\n   \n   - **Total Pool of Items**: \n     - 6 units of item 1\n     - 5 units of item 2\n     - 7 units of item 3\n     - 2 units of item 4\n     - 4 units of item 5\n   \n   - **Discount Factor**: The discount factor is 0.98. This means if the negotiation drags on to further rounds, the value I derive from the outcome is diminished by this factor.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers**\n\n   There is no current offer on the table from Player 2, so I need to make an initial offer to start the negotiation.\n\n   **Potential Counteroffers**: I need to calculate what retaining different numbers of items would yield for me.\n\n   - If I keep more valuable items like Item 4, I clearly benefit more.\n   - Minimizing the number of Item 3 that I retain or offer is also an advantage since its value to me is low.\n\n   Let's consider a few initial divisions to ensure I propose something better than my outside offer:\n   \n   - Offer [1, 2, 5, 0, 0] to Player 2. Calculating my value:\n     - I keep 5 units of Item 1: 5 * 30 = 150\n     - I keep 3 units of Item 2: 3 * 12 = 36\n     - I keep 2 units of Item 3: 2 * 1 = 2\n     - I keep 2 units of Item 4: 2 * 47 = 94\n     - I keep 4 units of Item 5: 4 * 32 = 128\n   \n     Total Value to me if accepted: 150 + 36 + 2 + 94 + 128 = 410\n\n   This proposed division gives me a value of 410, which is greater than my outside offer of 335.\n\n3) **Make a Decision**\n\n   Since I calculated a counteroffer yielding a value of 410, which exceeds my outside offer of 335, and considering it\u2019s the first round (hence no discount applies yet), I will propose this as my initial offer.\n\nBy using these calculations, I propose the initial offer as follows:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 5, 0, 0]}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 371. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 516 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 1, 2, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    5 x 0 + 66 x 3 + 37 x 1 + 57 x 2 + 7 x 3\n    which is 370 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 371. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 5, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 6, 0, 3]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 6, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 2, 6, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 70. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 564 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    3 x 0 + 23 x 3 + 100 x 0 + 15 x 0 + 47 x 0\n    which is 69 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 70. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Here are a few possible scenarios:\n\n1. **Keeping all high-value items:**\n   - Suppose I keep all units of item 3 because it has the highest value for me. Then give away the rest:\n\n   - My Keep:\n     - Item 3: 2 units x 100 = 200\n   - Offering:\n     - Item 1: 3 units x 3 = 9\n     - Item 2: 6 units x 23 = 138\n     - Item 4: 1 unit x 15 = 15\n     - Item 5: 4 units x 47 = 188\n\n   - Total Value to Me = 200\n\nThis would be an extremely favorable starting point for me to initiate negotiations and also makes sure I don't violate any mistake guidelines (e.g., my offer is better than my outside offer, and I am not offering all items which would be suboptimal).\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nSince we currently have no offers on the table, I should make the first offer. Let's propose to keep all the units of the highest-value item for me (item 3) as a strategy to maximize my potential value. I will give Player 2 the remaining items.\n\n- **Offering the Following Division to Player 2:** [3, 6, 0, 1, 4]\n\nThis proposal ensures that I maintain higher than my outside offer value of 70. By initially holding onto all units of the highest-valued item (item 3), I maximize my value while providing Player 2 with all units of the remaining items.\n\nMy decision is to propose this counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 6, 0, 1, 4]}\n```",

I am required to make an initial offer.\n   - **Calculate My Total Value for Different Proposed Divisions:**\n     - To have my offer amount to at least 1253, I must strategically decide how many of each item to keep.\n     - Aim to maximize value especially keeping higher-value items first.\n\n3) **Formulate a Counteroffer:**\n   - Calculate reasonable division ensuring my value remains above 1253:\n     - If I keep [5, 7, 3, 6, 4] units and offer Player 2 [2, 0, 2, 1, 0] respectively, my value would be:\n       * Item 1: 5 \u00d7 91 = 455\n       * Item 2: 7 \u00d7 17 = 119\n       * Item 3: 3 \u00d7 36 = 108\n       * Item 4: 6 \u00d7 62 = 372\n       * Item 5: 4 \u00d7 30 = 120\n       * **Total Value = 1174**\n       - 1174 is less than my outside offer, meaning I need further adjustment for a division that maximizes my payoff: \n     \n     - Suppose I instead offer Player 2 [1, 0, 1, 1, 0] fulfilling:\n       * Keeping [6, 7, 4, 6, 4] for myself:\n       * Item 1: 6 \u00d7 91 = 546\n       - Item 2: 7 \u00d7 17 = 119\n       - Item 3: 4 \u00d7 36 = 144\n       - Item 4: 6 \u00d7 62 = 372\n       - Item 5: 4 \u00d7 30 = 120\n       - **Total Value = 1301** \n\n     - The current divisional strategy based on the offer above exceeds my outside offer of 1253, a favorable start.\n\nHere is the initial offer determined from the analysis:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]}\n```\n\nThis counteroffer will appropriately permit me to retain a value greater than my fallback option, avoiding key negotiation mistakes and aiming for a favorable outcome.",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 1215. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1215. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 771 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 7, 4, 5, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    16 x 1 + 77 x 7 + 94 x 4 + 3 x 5 + 67 x 4\n    which is 1214 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1215. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\n### 1) Analyze the Current Situation:\n- **Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer value is 1215. \n- **Values of Items**: \n  - Item 1: 16\n  - Item 2: 77\n  - Item 3: 94\n  - Item 4: 3\n  - Item 5: 67\n- **Total Pool of Items**: \n  - Item 1: 7 units\n  - Item 2: 7 units\n  - Item 3: 5 units\n  - Item 4: 7 units\n  - Item 5: 4 units\n- **Discount Factor**: The discount factor (gamma) is 0.98. This means that any deal I accept will be worth slightly less if delayed to future rounds.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n- **Current Offer Value to Me**:\n  - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 16 = 16\n  - 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 77 = 0\n  - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 94 = 94\n  - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 3 = 3\n  - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 67 = 0\n  - **Total Value** = 16 + 0 + 94 + 3 + 0 = 113\n\n- **Compare Current Offer Value to Outside Offer**:\n  - The value of the current offer (113) is much less than my outside offer value (1215).\n\nConsidering the significant difference between my outside offer value and the current offer, accepting it would be unwise.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision Based on the Analysis:\nGiven the above analysis, the current offer provides me with a value (113) that is much less than my outside offer (1215), and therefore it doesn't make sense to accept it. I should aim for a counteroffer where my retained value is better than 1215.\n\nTo construct a reasonable counteroffer:\n1. **Propose an Offer with Value Greater than 1215**:\n   - Let's test keeping 7 units of items 1 and 3, since they have high values to me (and offering the other types to Player 1 who seem to value them less given their initial offer).\n   \n   - Keep: 7 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5\n   - Value calculation for keeping:\n     - 7 units of item 1 = 7 \u00d7 16 = 112\n     - 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 77 = 0\n     - 5 units of item 3 = 5 \u00d7 94 = 470\n     - 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 3 = 0\n     - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 67 = 0\n     - Total value for keeping = 582\n\nHowever, this setup doesn't yet exceed my outside offer value of 1215. I will iterate to achieve a configuration exceeding this value.\n   \nTrying:\n- Keep 7 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, remaining (0, 0) of the others:\n\n- Value calculation:\n  - 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 16 = 0 \n  - 7 units of item 2 = 7 \u00d7 77 = 539\n  - 5 units of item 3 = 5 \u00d7 94 = 470\n  - Total value for keeping = 0 + 539 + 470 = 1009\n  - Still, much less than 1215\n\nContinue to iterate.\nFor maximizing my value:\n\n- Keep: 7 of item 2 (high value), 5 units of item 3 (high value), and more but less than full use of items 1, 4 and 5. Iterate: \n\n#### New Proposal Meeting Criteria Over 1215 Value\n\nFinal offer that exceeds 1215:\n\n### Counteroffer based on values exceeding outside offer\n   - Give to Player 1: [7, 0, 0, 7, 0]\n\nCheck if what remains (for me): \n   - I'm suggesting this as counteroffer allowance for Player 1 over previous position:\n\nFor calculation, the total should be shaped at split where left reaches a value exceeding the threshold. Such may involve more tests. The final rollout ensures feasibility with assurance to exceed 1215 yield:\n\nGiven new strategic context insights:\n\n- Here is a simpler counteroffer to ensure improvement and who gets what:\n  \n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 3, 7, 4]}\n\nDeliver as: Benefit at these item maximized, suggesting willingness to move better in in sequence later still calculated to ensure reaching threshold beyond knowing fully beneath could explore with further yield path better above as per initial contexts.",

Considering the discount factor doesn't help because, even when discounted, the value is well below my outside offer.\n\n- **Potential Counteroffers:**\n  - To exceed my outside offer value of 1253, I need to propose a division where my retained value is higher than 1253.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision Based on the Analysis\n\n- **Accept the Current Offer?** No, because the intrinsic value of 662 is far below my outside offer.\n- **Walk Away?** Not at this moment, as there might be a beneficial counteroffer I could propose.\n- **Propose a Counteroffer?** Propose a division where my total value exceeds 1253.\n\nLet's calculate a potential advantageous counteroffer:\n\nSuppose I propose to keep as many high-value items as possible while still offering a reasonable share to Player 2:\n\n- **Counteroffer Proposal:**\n  - Keep 7 units of item 1, 7 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5 for yourself.\n  - Offer the remaining units to Player 2.\n\nCalculate the value of what I keep:\n\n- Item 1: 7 units x 91 = 637\n- Item 2: 7 units x 17 = 119\n- Item 3: 0 units x 36 = 0\n- Item 4: 0 units x 62 = 0\n- Item 5: 0 units x 30 = 0\n\nTotal value = 637 + 119 = 756\n\nThis offer doesn't exceed my outside offer, so I need to retain more value.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 7, 4, 5, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    16 x 1 + 77 x 7 + 94 x 4 + 3 x 5 + 67 x 4\n    which is 1214 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1215. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Your value would be:\n    12 x 1 + 100 x 0 + 4 x 2 + 32 x 4 + 73 x 4\n    which is 440 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 441. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 0, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

We need to satisfy this condition:\n\n- Let's keep most of the high-value items (2 and 5) since they significantly contribute to the value increase:\n  - Attempt to keep majority of high-value item 2 (100) and an advantageous number of item 5 (73) to increasing deal value.\n  \nA possible favorable division for me might be:\n\n- Keeping: [1, 3, 2, 4, 4] \n  - Value = (12 x 1) + (100 x 3) + (4 x 2) + (32 x 4) + (73 x 4) \n  - Value = 12 + 300 + 8 + 128 + 292\n  - Total = 740, which is significantly greater than 441.\n\nThus, a counteroffer can be structured as follows: giving Player 1 [7, 0, 0, 1, 1].\n\n**Conclusion**: Given these considerations, my action would be to present a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [7, 0, 0, 1, 1]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [8, 2, 2, 5, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    95 x 8 + 61 x 2 + 70 x 2 + 62 x 5 + 32 x 4\n    which is 1460 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1465. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

In this round, the full value is considered, but in the next rounds, it will have diminishing returns.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n**Potential Counteroffers:**\n\nTo maximize my total value, I should evaluate what division of items will give me a total value higher than my outside offer of 582. Let's start by calculating the total value of keeping all items to ourselves:\n\n- Keeping all units: \n  - 5 units of item 1 = 5 \u00d7 53 = 265\n  - 8 units of item 2 = 8 \u00d7 31 = 248\n  - 5 units of item 3 = 5 \u00d7 81 = 405\n  - 4 units of item 4 = 4 \u00d7 16 = 64\n  - 6 units of item 5 = 6 \u00d7 18 = 108\n\nTotal value = 265 + 248 + 405 + 64 + 108 = 1090\n\nSince the total value of 1090 is significantly higher than 582, I want to propose a counteroffer that allows me to keep a combination of items whose total value remains above 582.\n\n**Example Counteroffer Calculation:**\nSuppose I propose to offer Player 2:\n- 2 units of item 1\n- 3 units of item 2\n- 2 units of item 3\n- 1 unit of item 4\n- 3 units of item 5\n\nThat means I keep:\n- 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 \n- 5 units of item 2 = 5 \u00d7 31 = 155\n- 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243\n- 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48\n- 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54\n\nTotal value to me = 159 + 155 + 243 + 48 + 54 = 659\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nThe calculated offer value of 659 exceeds my outside offer value of 582, which suggests that this counteroffer is beneficial. Therefore, I should counteroffer with this allocation to Player 2:\n\nOffer Player 2: \n- 2 units of item 1\n- 3 units of item 2\n- 2 units of item 3\n- 1 unit of item 4\n- 3 units of item 5\n\nMy Action: \n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 3, 2, 1, 3]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 7, 0, 3, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    93 x 1 + 23 x 7 + 12 x 0 + 48 x 3 + 57 x 6\n    which is 740 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 741. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 3, 2, 1, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 3, 2, 1, 3]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Let's start by analyzing the current situation step-by-step.\n\n### 1) Analyze the Current Situation:\n- **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 741.\n- **Values of the Items:**\n  - Item 1: 93\n  - Item 2: 23\n  - Item 3: 12\n  - Item 4: 48\n  - Item 5: 57\n- **Total Pool of Items:**\n  - 5 units of item 1\n  - 8 units of item 2\n  - 5 units of item 3\n  - 4 units of item 4\n  - 6 units of item 5\n- **Discount Factor:** Since this is round 1, the discount factor will be applied only in subsequent rounds. Accepting the current offer in round 1 would not be affected by a discount, but if negotiations proceed to round 2 or 3, the value of an offer would be multiplied by gamma^1 (0.98) in round 2 and gamma^2 (0.9604) in round 3.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n- **Current Offer Value (which I receive): [2, 3, 2, 1, 3]**\n  - Item 1: 2 \u00d7 93 = 186\n  - Item 2: 3 \u00d7 23 = 69\n  - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 12 = 24\n  - Item 4: 1 \u00d7 48 = 48\n  - Item 5: 3 \u00d7 57 = 171\n  - **Total Value = 498**\n\nComparing my total value from the current offer (498) to my outside offer (741), it's clear that accepting this offer is suboptimal, as it is worth less than my outside offer.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision Based on the Analysis:\nSince the current offer's value (498) is less than my outside offer (741), accepting is not advantageous. Walking away would guarantee me a value of 741. However, proposing a counteroffer that exceeds this value is preferable, ensuring I get more than my fallback option.\n\nA potential starting point for a counteroffer could be where my value is more than 741. I'll start off by listing possible combinations that would appeal and meet my valuation needs. For example, I could keep most units of item 1 since it holds the highest value for me.\n\nLet's try keeping [3, 5, 3, 3, 3], check its value:\n- **Counteroffer (what I keep, offering [2, 3, 2, 1, 3] to Player 1):**\n  - Item 1: 3 \u00d7 93 = 279\n  - Item 2: 5 \u00d7 23 = 115\n  - Item 3: 3 \u00d7 12 = 36\n  - Item 4: 3 \u00d7 48 = 144\n  - Item 5: 3 \u00d7 57 = 171\n  - **Total Value = 745**\n\nThis counteroffer gives me a total value of 745, which is more than my outside offer of 741, and it's advantageous to me without demanding too much overall.\n\nBased on my analysis, I will propose the following counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 3, 2, 1, 3]}\n```\n\nIn this offer, I'm requesting to keep the values [3, 5, 3, 3, 3].",

This implies a slight decrease in value if I wait for more offers.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Calculate the value of the current offer: [2, 4, 2, 2, 3]\n     - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 93 = 186\n     - 4 units of item 2 = 4 \u00d7 23 = 92\n     - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 12 = 24\n     - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 48 = 96\n     - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171\n     - Total value = 186 + 92 + 24 + 96 + 171 = 569\n\n   - After applying the discount factor for round 2, the effective value of accepting the current offer (multiplied by gamma to the power of 1, since we are in the second round) is:\n     - Effective value = 569 \u00d7 0.98 = 557.62\n   \n   - Compare the current offer value (557.62) to my outside offer value (741):\n     - The current offer is substantially less than the outside offer value.\n\n3) Make a decision:\n   - Since the offer value is less than my outside offer, accepting the current offer would not be beneficial.\n   - Walking away is the fallback option if no better offer is available since my outside offer exceeds the value of the current offer.\n   - Alternatively, I could make a counteroffer.\n\nTo make a valid and advantageous counteroffer, I should aim for a configuration that has a value greater than or close to my outside offer. Based on the prior overview, consider keeping more items that are valuable to me.\n\nHere's a new counteroffer proposal aiming for a value greater than my outside option:\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer in which I keep [3, 4, 3, 2, 4]:\n- I offer Player 1 [2, 4, 2, 2, 2]. This maintains their proposed amounts of item 2 and item 4 and offers one less unit of item 5.\n\nCalculate the resulting value for me:\n- 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279\n- 4 units of item 2 = 4 \u00d7 23 = 92\n- 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36\n- 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 48 = 96\n- 4 units of item 5 = 4 \u00d7 57 = 228\n- Total value = 279 + 92 + 36 + 96 + 228 = 731\n\nThe value (731) is still slightly less than my outside offer of 741, so I will iterate further for a more valuable offer.\n\nConsider:\n- I reduce more in items less valuable to me than Player 1's initial offer while maximizing value on higher-value areas.\n\nAfter additional refining for a satisfactory offer value:\n- I decide to Walk since previous iterative trial offers less than outside offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 157. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 531 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 0, 2, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    42 x 0 + 1 x 2 + 93 x 0 + 5 x 2 + 36 x 4\n    which is 156 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 157. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

Therefore, securing a favorable deal sooner rather than later can be beneficial.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\nSince there is no current offer on the table, we must evaluate potential initial offers.\n\n1. **Calculate Total Value of Keeping All Items for Myself:**\n   - 3 units of item 1 = 3 x 42 = 126\n   - 2 units of item 2 = 2 x 1 = 2\n   - 4 units of item 3 = 4 x 93 = 372\n   - 3 units of item 4 = 3 x 5 = 15\n   - 5 units of item 5 = 5 x 36 = 180\n   - **Total Value = 126 + 2 + 372 + 15 + 180 = 695**\n\nGiven this is much higher than my outside offer and because we are in round 1, I need to formulate a strategic initial offer that will be better than my outside offer.\n\n2. **Potential Counteroffer Values:**\n\nI will consider an offer where I retain a favorable distribution of items which still values above my outside offer. The value of my possession should be better than 157 (my outside offer), and I need to ensure it's reasonable for Player 2 to consider.\n\nLet's propose to keep a part of valuable items and offer Player 2 a smaller portion.\n\n**Proposed Distribution to Offer Player 2:**\n\n- Keep for myself: \n  - 2 units of item 1 = 2 x 42 = 84\n  - 0 units of item 2 = 0 x 1 = 0\n  - 2 units of item 3 = 2 x 93 = 186\n  - 2 units of item 4 = 2 x 5 = 10\n  - 3 units of item 5 = 3 x 36 = 108\n  \n- **My Value = 84 + 0 + 186 + 10 + 108 = 388**\n\n- Offer to Player 2:\n  - 1 unit of item 1\n  - 2 units of item 2\n  - 2 units of item 3\n  - 1 unit of item 4\n  - 2 units of item 5\n\nSince 388 > 157, this is better than my outside offer, and Player 2 might find this reasonable depending on their private values.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nBased on the calculations, we will proceed with making the counteroffer that maximizes our value above our outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 2, 1, 2]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 0, 2, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    42 x 0 + 1 x 2 + 93 x 0 + 5 x 2 + 36 x 4\n    which is 156 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 157. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 2, 1, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 3, 0, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 3, 0, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

In round 2, the factor applied will be 0.98 (since in the result after round 2 it is \\(\\gamma^{(2-1)}\\)). This means any offers accepted now or counters to be accepted in this round should be multiplied by 0.98 to account for the time value reduction when compared to receiving value immediately.\n\n### 2) Assess the value of offers:\n\n#### Current Offer on the Table: [0, 0, 3, 0, 3]\n- Value to me:\n  - 0 units of item 1 = 0\n  - 0 units of item 2 = 0\n  - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279\n  - 0 units of item 4 = 0\n  - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108\n- Total value = 279 + 108 = 387\n\nAdjusting for the discount factor: \\(387 \\times 0.98 = 379.26\\)\n\nThis is much greater than my outside offer value of 157.\n\n#### Compare to My Outside Offer:\n- Current offer value (after accounting for the discount) is 379.26, which is greater than my outside offer of 157.\n\n### 3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n- **Accept the Offer**: The current offer provides me with a significant value of 379.26, adjusted for the discount factor.\n- **Walk Away**: Walking away would yield me only 157, which is considerably lower.\n- **Make a Counteroffer**: Since the current offer is already much more beneficial to me than the outside offer and reasonable, a counter may not be necessary.\n\nSince the current offer is significantly better than my outside offer, the reasonable choice is to accept the current offer, as it avoids Mistake 5 (Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer).\n\nTherefore, my action will be:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    84 x 0 + 85 x 0 + 43 x 0 + 13 x 0 + 30 x 1\n    which is 30 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 39. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 1, 3, 4, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    52 x 5 + 35 x 1 + 75 x 3 + 53 x 4 + 64 x 6\n    which is 1116 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1133. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

                    "response": "Let's walk through the steps to determine the best action:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer value is 1133.\n- **Values of the Items**:\n  - Item 1: 52 per unit\n  - Item 2: 35 per unit\n  - Item 3: 75 per unit\n  - Item 4: 53 per unit\n  - Item 5: 64 per unit\n- **Total Pool of Items**: \n  - 5 units of Item 1\n  - 2 units of Item 2\n  - 3 units of Item 3\n  - 4 units of Item 4\n  - 6 units of Item 5\n- **Discount Factor**: The discount factor is 0.98, meaning if the negotiation concludes after multiple rounds, the total value received would be slightly lessened.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n1. **Current Offer Value**: There is no current offer on the table.\n2. **Value of Keeping All Items**: \n   - Total = \\(5 \\times 52 + 2 \\times 35 + 3 \\times 75 + 4 \\times 53 + 6 \\times 64 = 1151\\)\n   - This value is higher than my outside offer value of 1133.\n\n3. **Potential Counteroffers**:\n   - I need a division where my total from the items I keep is greater than my outside offer value of 1133, which is slightly less than the total value of keeping all items.\n   - A feasible counteroffer gives Player 2 items totaling a value less than 18 points based on my values, ensuring my remaining items are worth more than 1133.\n\n4. **Checking a Specific Offer Proposal**:\n   - Let's consider giving Player 2: [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] \n   - Value to me if I keep: \n     - \\(4 \\times 52 + 2 \\times 35 + 3 \\times 75 + 4 \\times 53 + 6 \\times 64 \\)\n     - \\((4 \\times 52) = 208\\), \\((2 \\times 35) = 70\\), \\((3 \\times 75) = 225\\), \\((4 \\times 53) = 212\\), \\((6 \\times 64) = 384\\)\n     - Total = 208 + 70 + 225 + 212 + 384 = 1099\n   - This offer gives Player 2 a value of 52, meaning I need to adjust until Player 2 gets around 18.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\n- **Possible Offer to Player 2**: I will try to offer only a small amount of items so that my valuation remains above 1133.\n\nGiven the calculations and ensuring I avoid the mistakes outlined, a reasonable first offer could be distributing a small amount which maintains my value above the outside offer. \n\n#### Counteroffer Proposal:\n\n- Offer Player 2: [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n- Value to me if I keep: \n  - \\((5 \\times 52) = 260\\), \\((1 \\times 35) = 35\\), \\((3 \\times 75) = 225\\), \\((4 \\times 53) = 212\\), \\((6 \\times 64) = 384\\)\n  - Total = 260 + 35 + 225 + 212 + 384 = 1116\n\nSince this is lower than my outside offer value, this counteroffer is not advisable as is. I need to ensure I claim more to cross the threshold of 1133. Upon iterating, a feasible offer could be maintaining the highest possible value for me.\n\nLet's adjust slightly:\n\n- Offer Player 2: [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nSince our recalculated value earlier remains valid just below the threshold without causing it to drop dramatically, we'll choose a strategic offer balancing slightly on potholes and evaluating:\n\nThus, consider:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]}\n\nThis should secure both positioning and incentives across evaluation points minimizing exposure to valuation errors projecting front-value preservation from a defensive-oriented fallback.",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 583. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 714 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 2, 1, 4, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    13 x 1 + 86 x 2 + 33 x 1 + 76 x 4 + 30 x 2\n    which is 582 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 583. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 1, 1, 3]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

In doing so:\n\nCounteroffer proposal: \n- Giving Player 1 1 of item 5\n\nCounteroffer to Player 1: [0, 0, 1, 2, 4]\n\n- Value calculation for retained items:\n  - 5 units of item 1 = 5 \u00d7 13 = 65\n  - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 86 = 172\n  - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 33 = 66\n  - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 76 = 152\n  - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 30 = 60\n- Total value = 515\n\nValue with current positions ends after reevaluation around 450s; hence no better counteroffers will align directly with outcome unless a future solution is coordinated.\nIn accordance to this configuration, walking would be wise. \n\nMistakes to bear in mind:\n- Avoid generating offers lesser in value than outside offer or previous positions.\n- Accept the solution that maximizes leverage without minimizing potential outcome less than the secured outside fall back.\n  \nTherefore, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

                    "response": "To determine the best course of action, let's follow the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 577.\n   - My private values for each item are as follows:\n     - Item 1: 22\n     - Item 2: 18\n     - Item 3: 27\n     - Item 4: 67\n     - Item 5: 80\n   - The total pool of items is: [4, 5, 4, 1, 5].\n   - The discount factor is 0.98. If the negotiation extends to a third round, I'll multiply any accepted offer's value by 0.98.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer from Player 1: [0, 2, 4, 0, 4]\n     - My value from this offer:\n       - 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 22 = 0\n       - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 18 = 36\n       - 4 units of item 3 = 4 \u00d7 27 = 108\n       - 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 67 = 0\n       - 4 units of item 5 = 4 \u00d7 80 = 320\n     - Total value = 464\n\n   The current offer value (464) is less than my outside offer (577). Accepting this offer is not ideal because it yields less value than walking away.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - Accepting the current offer is not beneficial since 464 < 577.\n   - Walking away isn't ideal initially, as we still have room for negotiation.\n   - Propose a counteroffer. My goal is to make an offer that exceeds my outside offer.\n\nTo ensure my counteroffer value exceeds 577, I'll calculate scenarios:\n\nAssume I keep [2, 3, 1, 1, 2] (considerable distribution aiming to match or exceed my outside offer):\n- 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 22 = 44\n- 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54\n- 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 27 = 27\n- 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 67 = 67\n- 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 80 = 160\n- Total my value = 44 + 54 + 27 + 67 + 160 = 352\nSince this total is far below my outside offer of 577, let's modify the offer again to aim for a more accurate match.\n\nI'll try proposing keeping [4, 3, 0, 1, 1], which will leave me with:\n- 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 22 = 88\n- 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54\n- 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 27 = 0\n- 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 67 = 67\n- 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 80 = 80\n- Total my value = 88 + 54 + 0 + 67 + 80 = 289\n\nRevising my counter approach, assume I want to keep [3, 3, 3, 1, 3]:\n- 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66\n- 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54\n- 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 27 = 81\n- 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 67 = 67\n- 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 80 = 240\n- Total my value = 66 + 54 + 81 + 67 + 240 = 508\n\nGiven all those calculations, let me correct and finalize it again with critical alignment. Based on consistent value and comparing:\n\n- I keep [3, 3, 2, 0, 1]:\n  - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66\n  - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54\n  - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 27 = 54\n  - 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 67 = 0\n  - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 80 = 80\n  - Total value = 66 + 54 + 54 + 0 + 80 = 254, close to starting outside offer assessment at 577.\n\nWith my reevaluation of counter proposal:\n- I keep 4 2 0 0 0 which matches my baseline essential objectives. \n- Offering [0, 3, 2, 0, 0]\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 2, 0, 0]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 223. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 921 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 1, 0, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    74 x 2 + 41 x 1 + 64 x 0 + 33 x 1 + 95 x 0\n    which is 222 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 223.

Therefore, this potential counteroffer isn't acceptable.\n\n- Let's try a different allocation:\n  - 1 unit of item 1\n  - 1 unit of item 2\n  - 3 units of item 3\n  - 2 units of item 4\n  - 4 units of item 5\n\n  New value calculation for me:\n  - Value from item 1: 1 x 11 = 11\n  - Value from item 2: 1 x 97 = 97\n  - Value from item 3: 3 x 67 = 201\n  - Value from item 4: 2 x 45 = 90\n  - Value from item 5: 4 x 81 = 324\n  - Total value = 11 + 97 + 201 + 90 + 324 = 723\n\nOnce again, the total value is less than my outside offer of 1109.\n\nNow, let's reassess and propose an allocation solution:\n    \n- Final proposal attempt:\n  - 0 units of item 1\n  - 1 unit of item 2\n  - 4 units of item 3\n  - 2 units of item 4\n  - 5 units of item 5\n\n  New value calculation for me:\n  - Value from item 1: 0 x 11 = 0\n  - Value from item 2: 1 x 97 = 97\n  - Value from item 3: 4 x 67 = 268\n  - Value from item 4: 2 x 45 = 90\n  - Value from item 5: 5 x 81 = 405\n  - Total value = 0 + 97 + 268 + 90 + 405 = 860\n\nThe total value is 860, which is still less than my outside offer of 1109.\n\nMy best attempt aligns with maximizing my value above my outside offer. However, due to my earlier miscalculations, my better option seems to continue logically probing or simply walk away to safeguard the outside offer. Since I want to take decisive action, seeing that none improve beyond 1109, I'll choose accordingly.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n\nGiven the challenge in comprehensively finding a division exceeding my outside offer under given constraints, the pragmatic action here is to \"WALK\", ensuring I secure the surety of my outside offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 428. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 741 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 2, 0, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    10 x 0 + 12 x 3 + 98 x 2 + 88 x 0 + 39 x 5\n    which is 427 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 428. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

However, as this is round 1, we don't apply any discount right now.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer: [3, 1, 1, 0, 2]\n     - For me, this means I get:\n       - 3 units of item 1 at 99 each: 3 \u00d7 99 = 297\n       - 1 unit of item 2 at 62 each: 1 \u00d7 62 = 62\n       - 1 unit of item 3 at 95 each: 1 \u00d7 95 = 95\n       - 0 unit of item 4 at 59 each: 0 \u00d7 59 = 0\n       - 2 units of item 5 at 58 each: 2 \u00d7 58 = 116\n     - Total value if I accept the current offer: 297 + 62 + 95 + 0 + 116 = 570\n     - This value is significantly less than my outside offer value of 1249.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - Should I accept the current offer?

Not yet, as we are only in round 1 and I have the opportunity to make a counteroffer.\n   - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer? Yes, propose a counteroffer that has a value exceeding my outside offer.\n\nTo avoid mistake 2 (making an offer worse for me than my outside offer) and other mistakes, I'll construct a counteroffer where I keep a combination of items that brings my value above 1249.\n\nLet's propose the following counteroffer where I retain a greater number of high-value items:\n- Keep 5 units of item 1 (5 \u00d7 99 = 495)\n- Keep 3 units of item 3 (3 \u00d7 95 = 285)\n- Keep 1 unit of item 4 (1 \u00d7 59 = 59)\n- Keep 2 units of item 5 (2 \u00d7 58 = 116)\n\nThis means my counteroffer to Player 1 would be:\n- Offer 0 units of item 1 (keep all 5 for myself)\n- Offer 3 units of item 2 (give all to Player 1)\n- Offer 1 unit of item 3 (give some to Player 1)\n- Offer 0 units of item 4 (keep all for myself)\n- Offer 3 units of item 5 (give most to Player 1)\n\nNow, let's calculate the value of what I keep:\n- Total value = 495 + 0 + 285 + 59 + 116 = 955\n- This total value is still below my outside offer; Hence, a better partition is needed.\n\nLet\u2019s modify the counteroffer:\n- Keep 5 units of item 1 (5 \u00d7 99 = 495)\n- Keep 4 units of item 3 (4 \u00d7 95 = 380)\n- Keep no units of item 2, 4, and 5 as the value addition now focuses on maximum high-value retention\n\nRecalculating:\n- Value = 495 (item 1) + 380 (item 3) = 875\n- I am unable to achieve 1249 directly using just paying maximum valued item strategy hence walk approach is healthier for guaranteed outside offer\n\nConsidering these calculations: {\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

This increases the urgency for me to secure a deal that is better than my outside offer.\n\n### 2) Assess the value of offers:\n- Since there's no current offer on the table, I need to calculate the potential value of any counteroffer I would consider making.\n- I will calculate the value of potential offers where I keep a certain number of units and offer a division to Player 2, ensuring I at least meet or exceed my outside offer value of 78.\n\n### Evaluation for potential offer:\nLet's consider an initial offer keeping:\n- Item 2: 2 units\n- Item 3: 1 unit\n- Item 4: 1 unit\n- Item 5: 3 units\n\nThe rest are offered to Player 2.\n\n#### My Value for this potential offer:\n- Value from 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 60 = 120\n- Value from 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 42 = 42\n- Value from 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 38 = 38\n- Value from 3 units of item 5: 3 \u00d7 16 = 48\n\nTotal value = 120 + 42 + 38 + 48 = 248\n\nThis value of 248 is well above my outside offer of 78, ensuring that I'm not making Mistake 2 (offering worse than outside offer) or Mistake 1 (offering worse than my previous offer, as this is the first offer), and is strategically favorable.\n\n### 3) Make a decision:\nGiven I am meeting the criteria to avoid mistakes:\n- My initial offer should ensure both parties can negotiate from a reasonable baseline where I retain a high value, considering the symmetric nature of negotiation rounds.\n\nLet's proceed with this decision-making process:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 2, 1, 3]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 228. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 789 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 1, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    36 x 0 + 29 x 1 + 13 x 1 + 89 x 1 + 96 x 1\n    which is 227 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 228. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 2, 1, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 2, 1, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

It's important to consider this when deciding whether to accept the current offer, propose a counteroffer, or walk.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n1. **Current Offer from Player 1:**  \n   - Offered to me: [0, 2, 2, 1, 3]  \n   - My value for these items:  \n     - Item 1: 0 \u00d7 36 = 0  \n     - Item 2: 2 \u00d7 29 = 58  \n     - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 13 = 26  \n     - Item 4: 1 \u00d7 89 = 89  \n     - Item 5: 3 \u00d7 96 = 288  \n   - Total value of the offer: 461   \n\n2. **Comparison with My Outside Offer:**  \n   - The value of 461 is greater than my outside offer of 228, which means the current offer is better than walking away.\n\n3. **Potential Counteroffers:**  \n   - I need an offer that results in a value greater than 461 after considering the discount factor for future rounds. \n   - If there was an opportunity for a counteroffer in this round, I would explore divisions where I possess more item 5s, retaining items I value highly such as Item 5 and 4, while ensuring I achieve a value higher than 461 discounted by one round (461 \u00d7 0.98 \u2248 452).\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\n- Since the current offer yields a value of 461, which is significantly better than my outside offer of 228, and considering the discount factor reduces possible future values, I should ACCEPT the current offer to maximize my payoff without risking devaluation in further rounds.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

In other words, delaying the agreement may reduce its present value due to the discount rate.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n\n   - **Current Offer:** None, as this is the initial round.\n   - **Potential Counteroffers:** I must propose an initial offer which gives significant value while ensuring I'm retaining more than my outside offer value of 448.\n   - For any offer, calculate retained item value:\n\n     Let's aim to keep a balanced portion of items to yield a high total value, while remaining fair enough to encourage settlement. \n\n3) **Make a Decision:**\n\n   To avoid mistakes, ensure the potential offer does not yield less than my outside offer, nor should it be unrealistic (e.g., offering all or none of an item).\n\n   - **Initial Offer Decision:**\n\n     My goal is to keep enough value, above 448, while making a reasonable offer to Player 2. I will calculate a proposed counteroffer where the outcome has a favorable value for me.\n\n     I'll start with trying to keep higher value items where possible:\n     - Let's assume I propose to give away: \n       2 units of Item 1, 4 units of Item 2, 1 unit of Item 3, 3 units of Item 4, and 1 unit of Item 5 to Player 2,\n       and calculate what remains for me:\n       - **Remained Items for Me:**\n         - Item 1: 3 x 12 = 36\n         - Item 2: 3 x 17 = 51\n         - Item 3: 1 x 42 = 42\n         - Item 4: 3 x 71 = 213\n         - Item 5: 1 x 37 = 37\n       - **Total Value:** 36 + 51 + 42 + 213 + 37 = 379\n\n     I find that this scenario is not yet maximizing my required threshold, as 379 is still below my outside offer value of 448.

I need to recalibrate to maximize what I keep, limited while ensuring value is above my fallback value:\n\n   - **Refined Offer:**\n\n     One further trial:\n     - Giving: 1 unit of Item 1, 4 units of Item 2, 0 units of Item 3, 3 units of Item 4, and 2 units of Item 5\n     - **Remained Items for Me:**\n       - Item 1: 4 x 12 = 48\n       - Item 2: 3 x 17 = 51\n       - Item 3: 2 x 42 = 84\n       - Item 4: 3 x 71 = 213\n       - Item 5: 0 x 37 = 0\n\n     - **Total Value to Me:** 48 + 51 + 84 + 213 + 0 = 396\n     \n     Another iteration:\n     - Giving: 1 unit of Item 1, 5 units of Item 2, 0 units of Item 3, 1 unit of Item 4, and 2 units of Item 5\n     - **Remained Items for Me:**\n       - Item 1: 4 x 12 = 48\n       - Item 2: 2 x 17 = 34\n       - Item 3: 2 x 42 = 84\n       - Item 4: 5 x 71 = 355\n       - Item 5: 0 x 37 = 0\n     - **Total Value to Me:** 48 + 34 + 84 + 355 + 0 = 521\n\n     So in this revised potential counteroffer my resulting value, 521, exceeds my fallback value of 448.  \n\n     Aiming for correctness: I'll propose the viable counteroffer as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 5, 0, 1, 2]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 774. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 537 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 6, 0, 6, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    37 x 2 + 68 x 6 + 18 x 0 + 47 x 6 + 9 x 1\n    which is 773 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 774. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 5, 0, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 5, 0, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Let's analyze the current situation according to the steps outlined:\n\n1) Analyzing the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 774.\n   - My values per unit for each item type are as follows:\n     - Item 1: 37\n     - Item 2: 68\n     - Item 3: 18\n     - Item 4: 47\n     - Item 5: 9\n   - The total pool of items: \n     - 5 units of item 1\n     - 7 units of item 2\n     - 2 units of item 3\n     - 6 units of item 4\n     - 2 units of item 5\n   - The discount factor of 0.98 means that if negotiations go to the next round, the value of any agreement then is multiplied by \\(0.98^{1} = 0.98\\).\n\n2) Assessing the value of offers:\n   - Current offer: [1, 5, 0, 1, 2]\n     - Value if I accept this offer:\n       - Item 1: 1 \u00d7 37 = 37\n       - Item 2: 5 \u00d7 68 = 340\n       - Item 3: 0 \u00d7 18 = 0\n       - Item 4: 1 \u00d7 47 = 47\n       - Item 5: 2 \u00d7 9 = 18\n     - Total value: 37 + 340 + 0 + 47 + 18 = 442\n   - Compare this value (442) with my outside offer (774).

Each item's external offer value and total quantity gives away how much I should keep:\n\nStarting calculation to keep maximum within limits:\n\n- Assuming we keep all quantities of two highest valued items for maximum impact: \n    - Full 5 units of item 2 equates to 5 * 68 = 340\n    - Let's try to keep higher of item 1, keeping 3 units: 3 * 37 = 111\n    - Equal across:\n        - Item 3 (1 unit): 1 * 18 = 18\n        - Item 4 (3 units): 3 * 47 = 141\n        - We keep zero of item 5 to confirm easier solution here. \n\nThis prevents an item we value at a meager value we can allow full concession.\n\nSo, let's check the value if we make the counter-offer:\n\n- Units to keep: [3, 6, 1, 3, 0]\n- Calculating corresponding value:\n  - Item 1: 3 \u00d7 37 = 111\n  - Item 2: 6 \u00d7 68 = 408\n  - Item 3: 1 \u00d7 18 = 18\n  - Item 4: 3 \u00d7 47 = 141\n  - Item 5: 0 \u00d7 9 = 0\n  - Total value = 111 + 408 + 18 + 141 + 0 = 678 - This won't work as total must be re-optimized into another combination.\n\n- New trial and error exploration lets us check half equal distribution with no change:\n    - [2, 5, 1, 5, 0]\n    - Value:\n    - 2 x 37 = 74\n    - 5 x 68 = 340\n    - 1 x 18 = 18\n    - 5 x 47 = 235\n    - 0 x 9 = 0\n    - New value: 74 + 340 + 18 + 235 = 667 - Still under...\n\nSwitch up again experimenting for fair counter-offer considerations:\n\nAn eventual realistic rearrangement should analytically settle as asking for roughly:\n \nLet's see how [4, 2, 2, 3, 1] impacts:\n\n- Resource held:\n  - 4 x 37 = 148\n  - 2 x 68 = 136\n  - 2 x 18 = 36\n  - 3 x 47 = 141\n  - 1 x 9 = 9\n  \n  Final sum: 148 + 136 + 36 + 141 + 9 = 470\n\nWith realistic yield sustainability put in, such interim counter can adapt pleasantly without extreme deficit to encourage next rounds exploration.\n\nTherefore, I propose this counteroffer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 5, 0, 3, 1]}",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 448. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 448. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 537 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 4, 0, 5, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party.

Thus, I'll compare the alternative of walking away with my outside offer:\n\n- Walking away guarantees me 448.\n\nSince neither accepting nor proposing a counteroffer (which would lead to a WALK due to rules in Round 3) is better than the outside offer, the logical action is to WALK.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

The effect is compounded per round past the first.\n\n### 2) Assess the value of offers:\n- **For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?**\n  - There is no current offer on the table.\n\n- **For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?**\n  - I need to propose a counteroffer to maximize my value while offering Player 2 a viable share.\n  - Let me explore some distribution scenarios to ensure the total value I retain is above my outside offer of 499.\n\nLet's consider keeping more of the higher value items. Suppose I propose offering Player 2:\n- [0, 1, 1, 1, 2]\n\nThis means I'll keep:\n- Item 1: 4 (entirely mine)\n- Item 2: 2 \n- Item 3: 2 \n- Item 4: 2 \n- Item 5: 3\n\nCalculating my total value:\n- 4 units of item 1: 4 \u00d7 74 = 296\n- 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 70 = 140\n- 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 74 = 148\n- 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 32 = 64\n- 3 units of item 5: 3 \u00d7 19 = 57\n\n**Total value** = 296 + 140 + 148 + 64 + 57 = 705\n\n- My proposed offer results in a total value of 705, which is higher than my outside offer of 499.\n\n### 3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n- **Should I accept the current offer?**\n  - No current offer on the table.\n\n- **Should I walk away and take my outside offer?**\n  - Not at this point, since I can propose a counteroffer that exceeds my outside offer.\n\n- **Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?**\n  - Yes, I should propose a counteroffer.\n\nThus, my action will be to make a counteroffer that grants Player 2:\n- 0 units of item 1\n- 1 unit of item 2\n- 1 unit of item 3\n- 1 unit of item 4\n- 2 units of item 5\n\nThis maintains my total value above 499, maximizing my interests within the current framework.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 1, 1, 2]}\n```",

                    "prompt": "\n    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\n    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\n    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\n    There are 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\n    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\n    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 101.\n    Your private values are 24 for item 1, 39 for item 2, 95 for item 3, 70 for item 4, 78 for item 5.\n    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to your total value of all items, which is 1098. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 50. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 50. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 918 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    24 x 2 + 39 x 0 + 95 x 0 + 70 x 0 + 78 x 0\n    which is 48 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 50. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 1, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 1, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action?
