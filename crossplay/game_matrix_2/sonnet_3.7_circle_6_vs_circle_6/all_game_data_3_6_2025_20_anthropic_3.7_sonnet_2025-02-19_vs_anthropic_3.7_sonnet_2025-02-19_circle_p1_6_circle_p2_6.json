If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    63 x 0 + 25 x 1 + 40 x 0 + 74 x 0 + 5 x 1\n    which is 30 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 32. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 0, 2, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    51 x 0 + 20 x 3 + 79 x 0 + 93 x 2 + 39 x 0\n    which is 246 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 247. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 0, 0, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 1, 1, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 1, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 5, 3, 2, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    34 x 3 + 76 x 5 + 54 x 3 + 29 x 2 + 4 x 3\n    which is 714 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 715. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

This means I would keep [3, 1, 1, 3, 3].\n\nValue calculation:\n- 1 unit of item 1: 1 \u00d7 34 = 34\n- 4 units of item 2: 4 \u00d7 76 = 304\n- 3 units of item 3: 3 \u00d7 54 = 162\n- 0 units of item 4: 0 \u00d7 29 = 0\n- 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 4 = 8\n- Total offered to me: 508\n\nWhat I'd keep:\n- 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 34 = 102\n- 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 76 = 76\n- 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 54 = 54\n- 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 29 = 87\n- 3 units of item 5: 3 \u00d7 4 = 12\n- Total I keep: 331\n\nTotal value of the offer: 508 (what they're giving me)\nWith discount factor: 508 \u00d7 0.98 = 497.84\n\nThis is significantly lower than my outside offer of 715, so I should not accept.\n\n## 3) Potential Counteroffer Analysis:\n\nLooking at the offers so far:\n- I offered [0, 0, 0, 2, 4] - keeping most high-value items\n- Player 2 offered [1, 4, 3, 0, 2] - they seem to value item 4 highly and possibly item 1, 3\n\nLet me create a counteroffer that maximizes my value while being potentially acceptable to Player 2:\n\nIf I offer [1, 1, 1, 2, 4]:\n- I keep [3, 4, 3, 1, 1]\n- Value calculation for what I keep:\n  * 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 34 = 102\n  * 4 units of item 2: 4 \u00d7 76 = 304\n  * 3 units of item 3: 3 \u00d7 54 = 162\n  * 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 29 = 29\n  * 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 4 = 4\n  * Total I keep: 601\n- With discount (0.98): 601 \u00d7 0.98 = 588.98\n\nThis is still less than my outside offer of 715.\n\nLet me try [1, 0, 1, 2, 4]:\n- I keep [3, 5, 3, 1, 1]\n- Value calculation for what I keep:\n  * 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 34 = 102\n  * 5 units of item 2: 5 \u00d7 76 = 380\n  * 3 units of item 3: 3 \u00d7 54 = 162\n  * 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 29 = 29\n  * 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 4 = 4\n  * Total I keep: 677\n- With discount (0.98): 677 \u00d7 0.98 = 663.46\n\nThis is better but still below my outside offer.\n\nLet me try [1, 0, 0, 2, 4]:\n- I keep [3, 5, 4, 1, 1]\n- Value calculation for what I keep:\n  * 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 34 = 102\n  * 5 units of item 2: 5 \u00d7 76 = 380\n  * 4 units of item 3: 4 \u00d7 54 = 216\n  * 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 29 = 29\n  * 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 4 = 4\n  * Total I keep: 731\n- With discount (0.98): 731 \u00d7 0.98 = 716.38\n\nThis is slightly above my outside offer of 715. Player 2 seemed to value items 1, 4, and 5, so I'm giving them some of each.\n\n## Decision:\n\nSince we're in round 2 of 3, and my best counteroffer just barely exceeds my outside offer, I think the optimal strategy is to WALK and take my outside offer of 715.\n\nThe counteroffer [1, 0, 0, 2, 4] would give me 716.38 with the discount factor, which is only marginally better than my outside offer. Given the uncertainty of whether Player 2 will accept this offer in the final round, the risk isn't worth the small potential gain.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 187. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 489 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 2, 3, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    13 x 0 + 67 x 0 + 57 x 2 + 23 x 3 + 3 x 1\n    which is 186 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 187. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 187. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 489 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 2, 3, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    13 x 0 + 67 x 0 + 57 x 2 + 23 x 3 + 3 x 1\n    which is 186 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 187. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 1, 0, 4, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 1, 2, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 2, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Their current offer gives me substantial value, and I'm risking further negotiation that could lead to walking away.\n\nGiven that the current offer is already quite good (significantly above my outside offer), and we're in round 2 with a discount factor in play, I believe accepting the current offer is the most prudent action.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 4, 2, 4, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    46 x 1 + 79 x 4 + 6 x 2 + 35 x 4 + 68 x 3\n    which is 718 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 719. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 1, 0, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 1, 0, 4]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "I need to analyze this offer and decide on my next move. Let me go through this step by step.\n\n## 1. Current Situation Analysis\n- My outside offer value is 719\n- My private values per item unit are:\n  - Item 1: 46 per unit\n  - Item 2: 79 per unit\n  - Item 3: 6 per unit\n  - Item 4: 35 per unit\n  - Item 5: 68 per unit\n- Total pool of items:\n  - Item 1: 6 units\n  - Item 2: 4 units\n  - Item 3: 4 units\n  - Item 4: 5 units\n  - Item 5: 5 units\n- Discount factor: 0.98 (not critical for this first round decision)\n\n## 2. Assess the Value of Current Offer\nThe current offer allocates to me: [0, 0, 1, 0, 4]\nMy value from this offer would be:\n- 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 46 = 0\n- 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 79 = 0\n- 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 6 = 6\n- 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 35 = 0\n- 4 units of item 5 = 4 \u00d7 68 = 272\nTotal value = 278\n\nThis is significantly less than my outside offer of 719, so I should not accept this offer.\n\n## 3. Potential Counteroffer Analysis\nI need to formulate a counteroffer that's better than my outside offer. Let me try to keep the high-value items for myself.\n\nIf I keep all of item 2 (my highest-valued item), most of item 5 (my second highest), and a mix of others, I should exceed my outside offer value.\n\nLet me propose giving Player 1:\n- 4 units of item 1 (keeping 2 for myself)\n- 0 units of item 2 (keeping all 4 for myself)\n- 3 units of item 3 (keeping 1 for myself)\n- 3 units of item 4 (keeping 2 for myself)\n- 1 unit of item 5 (keeping 4 for myself)\n\nMy value from this distribution would be:\n- 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 46 = 92\n- 4 units of item 2 = 4 \u00d7 79 = 316\n- 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 6 = 6\n- 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 35 = 70\n- 4 units of item 5 = 4 \u00d7 68 = 272\nTotal value = 756\n\nThis is greater than my outside offer of 719, so this is a reasonable counteroffer.\n\n## 4. Decision\nThe current offer is worth 278 to me, which is much less than my outside offer of 719.\n\nMy proposed counteroffer would be worth 756 to me, which exceeds my outside offer.\n\nLooking at Player 1's offer, they seem to value item 5 less (since they offered me 4 units), and they might value item 3 less (offered me 1 unit). However, they kept all of items 1, 2, and 4, suggesting they might value these more highly.\n\nMy counteroffer acknowledges this by offering them more of items 1, 3, and 4, while I keep more of items 2 and 5 that I value highly.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 0, 3, 3, 1]}",

For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 4, 2, 4, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    46 x 1 + 79 x 4 + 6 x 2 + 35 x 4 + 68 x 3\n    which is 718 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 719. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Player 1 is only asking for 4 units of item 5, which suggests they value item 5 highly.\n\nFrom the negotiation history, I can see that Player 1 initially offered me 1 unit of item 3 and 4 units of item 5, but now they're only offering me 4 units of item 5. In my counteroffer, I offered them 4 units of item 1, which they don't seem interested in.\n\nGiven that:\n1. The current offer exceeds my outside offer value\n2. We're already in round 2, so another round would reduce value due to discounting\n3. Player 1 seems to particularly value item 5\n\nI should accept this offer since it provides me with a value (841.82) that is well above my outside offer (719).\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 2, 2, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    48 x 0 + 80 x 0 + 7 x 2 + 54 x 2 + 95 x 4\n    which is 502 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 503. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 7, 2, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    85 x 0 + 88 x 7 + 65 x 2 + 67 x 2 + 41 x 2\n    which is 962 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 963. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

I could accept this offer.\n\nAlternatively, I could counter with an offer that increases my value while still being acceptable to Player 2. Based on their behavior, I should:\n- Keep all of item 4 (they seem to value it less)\n- Keep more of item 2 (they seem willing to give it up)\n- Give more of item 5 (they may value it more than I do)\n\nLet me calculate a counteroffer:\nIf I offer [1, 1, 2, 0, 5] to Player 2, I keep:\n- 2 of item 1: 2 \u00d7 85 = 170\n- 8 of item 2: 8 \u00d7 88 = 704\n- 2 of item 3: 2 \u00d7 65 = 130\n- 3 of item 4: 3 \u00d7 67 = 201\n- 2 of item 5: 2 \u00d7 41 = 82\n\nTotal value for me = 1287\nWith discount in next round (if accepted): 1287 \u00d7 0.98\u00b2 = 1236.99\n\nThis counteroffer would be better for me than accepting their current offer, but there's risk they might reject it.\n\n## 5) Final Decision\n\nWhile I could make a counteroffer, the current offer is already quite good and exceeds my outside offer by a significant margin. Since this is round 2 and we have limited rounds, accepting this offer has less risk than making a counteroffer that might be rejected.\n\nI'll accept the current offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 3, 2, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    25 x 3 + 78 x 3 + 73 x 2 + 4 x 1 + 63 x 0\n    which is 459 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 460. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 3, 2, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    25 x 3 + 78 x 3 + 73 x 2 + 4 x 1 + 63 x 0\n    which is 459 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 460. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 0, 0, 3, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [4, 1, 0, 0, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [4, 1, 0, 0, 4]\n\n    What is your action?

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 91. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 702 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 2, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    65 x 1 + 35 x 0 + 11 x 2 + 51 x 0 + 72 x 0\n    which is 87 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 91.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 91. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 702 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 2, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    65 x 1 + 35 x 0 + 11 x 2 + 51 x 0 + 72 x 0\n    which is 87 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 91. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 3, 3, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "I need to analyze this situation carefully to make the best decision.\n\n## 1. Analyzing the current situation:\n- My outside offer value is 91\n- My item values are: Item 1: 65, Item 2: 35, Item 3: 11, Item 4: 51, Item 5: 72\n- Total items: 11 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5\n- We're in round 2, so the discount factor of 0.98 will apply once (discount = 0.98^(2-1) = 0.98)\n\n## 2. Assessing the value of offers:\n\n**Value if I accept the current offer:**\nWith Player 2's offer [1, 1, 0, 0, 0], I would get 1 unit of item 1 and 1 unit of item 2.\nSo I keep [10, 4, 4, 3, 3] (total items minus what I give to Player 2).\nValue = (10\u00d765) + (4\u00d735) + (4\u00d711) + (3\u00d751) + (3\u00d772) = 650 + 140 + 44 + 153 + 216 = 1,203\nDiscounted value = 1,203 \u00d7 0.98 = 1,178.94\n\nThis is much higher than my outside offer of 91.\n\n**My previous offer:**\nI previously offered [3, 3, 3, 1, 0] to Player 2, which means I'd keep [8, 2, 1, 2, 3].\nValue = (8\u00d765) + (2\u00d735) + (1\u00d711) + (2\u00d751) + (3\u00d772) = 520 + 70 + 11 + 102 + 216 = 919\nThis was also much better than my outside offer.\n\n**Player 2's response and what it tells me:**\nPlayer 2 only wants 1 unit each of items 1 and 2, and none of the others. This suggests they might value these items most, while items 3, 4, and 5 are less valuable to them.\n\n## 3. Making a counteroffer:\nLet me try to make a counteroffer that improves my position while still being acceptable to Player 2.\n\nSince Player 2 seems to value items 1 and 2, I could offer slightly more of those while keeping most of items 3, 4, and 5 which they didn't request.\n\nLet me try [2, 2, 1, 0, 0] - meaning I'd give Player 2 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, and none of items 4 and 5.\n\nThis means I keep [9, 3, 3, 3, 3].\nValue = (9\u00d765) + (3\u00d735) + (3\u00d711) + (3\u00d751) + (3\u00d772) = 585 + 105 + 33 + 153 + 216 = 1,092\n\nDiscounted value at round 2 = 1,092 \u00d7 0.98 = 1,070.16\n\nThis is significantly better than my outside offer of 91, and represents a reasonable compromise that gives Player 2 more of what they seem to value while still maximizing my value.\n\n## Decision:\nI'll make a counteroffer of [2, 2, 1, 0, 0], giving Player 2 more of items 1 and 2 which they seem to value while keeping most of the items I value highly.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 1, 0, 0]}",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 2, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    65 x 1 + 35 x 0 + 11 x 2 + 51 x 0 + 72 x 0\n    which is 87 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 91. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 3, 3, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "I need to analyze this negotiation carefully to make the best decision for round 3, which is also the final round.\n\n## 1) Current Situation Analysis:\n- My outside offer value: 91\n- My item values: 65 for item 1, 35 for item 2, 11 for item 3, 51 for item 4, 72 for item 5\n- Total item pool: 11 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5\n- Discount factor: 0.98^(round-1) = 0.98^2 = 0.9604 for round 3\n\n## 2) Current Offer Evaluation:\nPlayer 2 is offering me [0, 0, 1, 0, 0], which means I would keep:\n- 11 units of item 1 = 11 \u00d7 65 = 715\n- 5 units of item 2 = 5 \u00d7 35 = 175\n- 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 11 = 33\n- 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 51 = 153\n- 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216\nTotal value before discount: 1292\nTotal value after discount: 1292 \u00d7 0.9604 = 1241.0368\n\nThis is significantly better than my outside offer of 91.\n\n## 3) Player 2's Negotiation Pattern:\nPlayer 2's offers have been increasingly favorable to me:\n- First offer: [1, 1, 0, 0, 0] - they wanted to keep most items\n- Second offer: [0, 0, 1, 0, 0] - they only want 1 unit of item 3\n\nThis suggests Player 2 might value item 3 but is willing to let me have almost everything else. They've consistently not asked for items 4 and 5, suggesting they might not value these highly.\n\n## 4) Decision:\nSince this is the final round and Player 2's current offer gives me a value of 1241.0368, which is much higher than my outside offer of 91, accepting is clearly the best option. If I try to counteroffer, Player 2 might walk away since this is the last round, and then I'd only get my outside offer of 91.\n\nThe offer on the table allows me to keep almost all items except for 1 unit of item 3, which has my lowest per-unit value (11). This is an excellent outcome for me.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 2, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    54 x 0 + 51 x 0 + 6 x 2 + 100 x 2 + 53 x 2\n    which is 318 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 319. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 6, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 6, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 6, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 2, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    54 x 0 + 51 x 0 + 6 x 2 + 100 x 2 + 53 x 2\n    which is 318 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 319. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 6, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 6, 2, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 6, 1, 1]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 0, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 0, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 410. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 564 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 3, 0, 2, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    84 x 4 + 15 x 3 + 62 x 0 + 14 x 2 + 13 x 0\n    which is 409 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 410. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 410. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 564 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 3, 0, 2, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    84 x 4 + 15 x 3 + 62 x 0 + 14 x 2 + 13 x 0\n    which is 409 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 410. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 0, 2, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 2, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 0, 2, 2]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 2, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 2, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "I need to analyze this negotiation carefully to make the best decision.\n\n## 1) Current Situation Analysis:\n- My outside offer value: 908\n- My item values: 1 for item 1, 66 for item 2, 56 for item 3, 96 for item 4, 71 for item 5\n- Total pool: 5 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 8 units of item 5\n- Discount factor: 0.98 (each round reduces value by 2%)\n\n## 2) Assessing Current Offer's Value:\nPlayer 1 is offering me [2, 1, 0, 0, 7], which means I would get:\n- 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 1 = 2\n- 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 66 = 66\n- 0 units of item 3: 0 \u00d7 56 = 0\n- 0 units of item 4: 0 \u00d7 96 = 0\n- 7 units of item 5: 7 \u00d7 71 = 497\nTotal value: 565\n\nThis is significantly lower than my outside offer of 908, so I should not accept.\n\n## 3) Analyzing Player 1's Offer For Insights:\nPlayer 1 offered me all but 1 unit of item 5, suggesting they might value item 5 quite low. They kept all of items 3 and 4, suggesting they may value these highly.\n\n## 4) Planning My Counteroffer:\nI need to keep enough value for myself while making a reasonable offer. Given I value item 4 (96) and item 2 (66) highly, I should try to keep most of these.\n\nLet me try this distribution (what I would keep):\n- Item 1: 3 units (keeping 3, offering 2)\n- Item 2: 2 units (keeping 2, offering 1)\n- Item 3: 1 unit (keeping 1, offering 1)\n- Item 4: 1 unit (keeping 1, offering 0)\n- Item 5: 4 units (keeping 4, offering 4)\n\nValue calculation for what I keep:\n- 3 \u00d7 1 = 3\n- 2 \u00d7 66 = 132\n- 1 \u00d7 56 = 56\n- 1 \u00d7 96 = 96\n- 4 \u00d7 71 = 284\nTotal value: 571\n\nThis is still far below my outside offer of 908. Let me adjust.\n\nLet me try keeping more of the high-value items:\n- Item 1: 1 unit (keeping 1, offering 4)\n- Item 2: 3 units (keeping 3, offering 0)\n- Item 3: 2 units (keeping 2, offering 0)\n- Item 4: 1 unit (keeping 1, offering 0)\n- Item 5: 6 units (keeping 6, offering 2)\n\nValue calculation for what I keep:\n- 1 \u00d7 1 = 1\n- 3 \u00d7 66 = 198\n- 2 \u00d7 56 = 112\n- 1 \u00d7 96 = 96\n- 6 \u00d7 71 = 426\nTotal value: 833\n\nThis is still below my outside offer of 908. Let me adjust one more time.\n\nLet me try keeping more of item 5:\n- Item 1: 1 unit (keeping 1, offering 4)\n- Item 2: 3 units (keeping 3, offering 0)\n- Item 3: 2 units (keeping 2, offering 0)\n- Item 4: 1 unit (keeping 1, offering 0)\n- Item 5: 7 units (keeping 7, offering 1)\n\nValue calculation for what I keep:\n- 1 \u00d7 1 = 1\n- 3 \u00d7 66 = 198\n- 2 \u00d7 56 = 112\n- 1 \u00d7 96 = 96\n- 7 \u00d7 71 = 497\nTotal value: 904\n\nThis is very close but still below my outside offer. Let's make one final adjustment to exceed 908.\n\nFinal counteroffer (what I'm offering to Player 1):\n- Item 1: 4 units (keeping 1)\n- Item 2: 0 units (keeping 3)\n- Item 3: 0 units (keeping 2)\n- Item 4: 0 units (keeping 1)\n- Item 5: 0 units (keeping 8)\n\nValue calculation for what I keep:\n- 1 \u00d7 1 = 1\n- 3 \u00d7 66 = 198\n- 2 \u00d7 56 = 112\n- 1 \u00d7 96 = 96\n- 8 \u00d7 71 = 568\nTotal value: 975\n\nThis exceeds my outside offer of 908, so this is a valid counteroffer for me.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 0, 0, 0, 0]}",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 511. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 511. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1065 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 3, 0, 0, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    68 x 3 + 97 x 3 + 100 x 0 + 85 x 0 + 5 x 3\n    which is 510 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 511. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

They've been consistently offering me most of item 5 (7 out of 8 units) and some of item 1, while keeping all of items 2, 3, and 4 for themselves.\n   \n   Since my values are:\n   - Item 1: 1 (very low value to me)\n   - Item 2: 66 (medium-high value)\n   - Item 3: 56 (medium value)\n   - Item 4: 96 (very high value)\n   - Item 5: 71 (high value)\n   \n   I should try to keep all of items 2, 3, 4, and some of item 5, while being willing to give up most or all of item 1.\n   \n   Let me try offering: [5, 0, 0, 0, 3]\n   This means I would keep:\n   - 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 1 = 0\n   - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198\n   - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 56 = 112\n   - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 96 = 96\n   - 5 units of item 5 = 5 \u00d7 71 = 355\n   Total value to me = 761\n   \n   With discount factor: 761 \u00d7 0.98 = 745.78\n   \n   This is less than my outside offer of 908, so this isn't a good counteroffer.\n   \n   Let me try again with: [5, 0, 0, 0, 2]\n   This means I keep:\n   - 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 1 = 0\n   - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198\n   - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 56 = 112\n   - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 96 = 96\n   - 6 units of item 5 = 6 \u00d7 71 = 426\n   Total value to me = 832\n   \n   With discount factor: 832 \u00d7 0.98 = 815.36\n   \n   Still less than my outside offer. Let's try one more option:\n   \n   Let me try: [5, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n   This means I keep:\n   - 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 1 = 0\n   - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198\n   - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 56 = 112\n   - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 96 = 96\n   - 7 units of item 5 = 7 \u00d7 71 = 497\n   Total value to me = 903\n   \n   With discount factor: 903 \u00d7 0.98 = 884.94\n   \n   This is still less than my outside offer of 908.\n\n4) Decision:\n   None of the counters I've considered exceed my outside offer value when accounting for the discount factor. Even keeping almost everything yields less value than my outside offer after the discount.\n   \n   Since we're in round 2 and the discount factor makes future deals less valuable, and none of my reasonable counters would exceed my outside offer, the optimal choice is to walk away.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 1214. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1214. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 999 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 8, 3, 6, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    89 x 2 + 17 x 8 + 94 x 3 + 72 x 6 + 61 x 3\n    which is 1211 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1214. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

                    "response": "I need to carefully evaluate the current situation and determine my best action.\n\n## Step 1: Analyze the current situation\n\n- My outside offer value: 927\n- My item values: 55 for item 1, 71 for item 2, 32 for item 3, 48 for item 4, 52 for item 5\n- Total items available: 2 units of item 1, 8 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5\n- Discount factor: 0.98 (affects value of future rounds)\n\n## Step 2: Assess the value of the current offer\n\nPlayer 1 is offering me [0, 5, 0, 1, 0], which means I would get:\n- 0 units of item 1\n- 5 units of item 2\n- 0 units of item 3\n- 1 unit of item 4\n- 0 units of item 5\n\nThis means Player 1 would keep [2, 3, 5, 5, 3].\n\nLet me calculate the value of this offer to me:\n- 0 \u00d7 55 = 0\n- 5 \u00d7 71 = 355\n- 0 \u00d7 32 = 0\n- 1 \u00d7 48 = 48\n- 0 \u00d7 52 = 0\n\nTotal value = 403\n\nThis is significantly less than my outside offer of 927, so I should not accept this offer.\n\n## Step 3: Consider potential counteroffers\n\nLooking at the offer Player 1 made, they seem to value item 1, item 3, and item 5 highly (keeping all units), while being willing to give up some of item 2 and item 4.\n\nLet me consider a counteroffer that would give me a value above my outside offer while being potentially acceptable to Player 1:\n\nI need to keep enough items to exceed my outside offer value of 927.\n\nLet me try keeping most of the high-value item 2, some of items 1, 4, and 5, and offering most of item 3 (which has lower value to me):\n\nIf I keep:\n- 1 unit of item 1: 1 \u00d7 55 = 55\n- 6 units of item 2: 6 \u00d7 71 = 426\n- 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 32 = 32\n- 4 units of item 4: 4 \u00d7 48 = 192\n- 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 52 = 104\n\nTotal value for me = 809, which is less than my outside offer.\n\nLet me adjust to keep more high-value items:\n- 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 55 = 110\n- 6 units of item 2: 6 \u00d7 71 = 426\n- 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 32 = 32\n- 4 units of item 4: 4 \u00d7 48 = 192\n- 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 52 = 104\n\nTotal value for me = 864, still less than my outside offer.\n\nLet's try again:\n- 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 55 = 110\n- 7 units of item 2: 7 \u00d7 71 = 497\n- 0 units of item 3: 0 \u00d7 32 = 0\n- 5 units of item 4: 5 \u00d7 48 = 240\n- 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 52 = 104\n\nTotal value for me = 951, which exceeds my outside offer of 927.\n\nThis means I would offer Player 1:\n[0, 1, 5, 1, 1]\n\nThis seems like a reasonable counteroffer as it gives me value above my outside offer while offering Player 1 all the item 3 units (which I value less), some of items 4 and 5, and a bit of item 2.\n\n## Decision\n\nI'll make a counteroffer to Player 1, offering them [0, 1, 5, 1, 1].

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 1214. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1214. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 999 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 8, 3, 6, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    89 x 2 + 17 x 8 + 94 x 3 + 72 x 6 + 61 x 3\n    which is 1211 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1214. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 5, 0, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 5, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 5, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Based on my analysis:\n\n1. The current offer ([0, 3, 0, 1, 0]) is worth much less than my outside offer (261 vs 927)\n2. Player 1 seems to value items 1, 3, and 5 highly\n3. I can propose a counteroffer of [0, 1, 3, 1, 1] which gives me a value of 994.7 (with discount)\n4. This counteroffer is better than my outside offer (994.7 > 927)\n5. It also gives Player 1 what seems important to them (most of items 1, some of 3, and some of 5)\n\nI believe this is a reasonable offer that meets my needs while addressing what appears to be important to Player 1.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 3, 1, 1]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1214. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 999 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 8, 3, 6, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    89 x 2 + 17 x 8 + 94 x 3 + 72 x 6 + 61 x 3\n    which is 1211 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1214. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Based on my values:\nItem 3 (94) > Item 1 (89) > Item 4 (72) > Item 5 (61) > Item 2 (17)\n\nI should try to keep all of items 1, 3, and 4, and adjust item 5 and 2 as needed:\n- Keep all item 1 (2 units): 2 \u00d7 89 = 178\n- Keep few of item 2 (say 3 units): 3 \u00d7 17 = 51\n- Keep all item 3 (5 units): 5 \u00d7 94 = 470\n- Keep all item 4 (6 units): 6 \u00d7 72 = 432\n- Keep all item 5 (3 units): 3 \u00d7 61 = 183\n\nTotal: 178 + 51 + 470 + 432 + 183 = 1314\n\nThis is better than my outside offer of 1214. \n\nBut this would mean offering Player 2 [0, 5, 0, 0, 0], which is quite aggressive in the final round. They've shown interest in items 3, 5, and some of items 2, 4. \n\nLet me adjust slightly to improve chances of acceptance:\n- Keep all item 1 (2 units): 2 \u00d7 89 = 178\n- Keep 5 units of item 2, offer 3: 5 \u00d7 17 = 85\n- Keep 4 units of item 3, offer 1: 4 \u00d7 94 = 376\n- Keep 5 units of item 4, offer 1: 5 \u00d7 72 = 360\n- Keep 2 units of item 5, offer a: 2 \u00d7 61 = 122\n\nTotal: 178 + 85 + 376 + 360 + 122 = 1121\n\nWith discount: 1121 \u00d7 0.9604 = 1077 (rounded)\n\nThis is still significantly less than my outside offer of 1214.\n\nGiven this is the final round and I cannot find a counteroffer that gives me more value than my outside offer after accounting for the discount factor, I should walk away.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Item 2 (9 per unit) - lowest value\n\nLet me try an initial offer where I keep most of my high-value items and offer more of my low-value items:\n\nIf I keep:\n- Item 1: 1 unit (27 value)\n- Item 2: 0 units (0 value)\n- Item 3: 2 units (128 value)\n- Item 4: 4 units (180 value)\n- Item 5: 3 units (177 value)\nTotal value for me: 512\n\nThis means I would offer to Player 2:\n- Item 1: 1 unit\n- Item 2: 3 units (all)\n- Item 3: 0 units\n- Item 4: 2 units\n- Item 5: 1 unit\n\nThis offer gives me 512 value, which exceeds my outside offer of 448, so it meets my minimum requirement.\n\n## 4) Final decision:\nI should make this counteroffer because:\n- It keeps my highest-value items (item 3)\n- It gives me a value (512) better than my outside offer (448)\n- It offers the other player all of my lowest-value item (item 2)\n- It appears reasonable and gives the other player a mix of different items\n\nTherefore, my offer to Player 2 (what I'm giving them) is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 3, 0, 2, 1]}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 1, 6, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    39 x 1 + 96 x 1 + 80 x 1 + 16 x 6 + 53 x 2\n    which is 417 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 418. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 0, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 3, 0, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 1, 6, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    39 x 1 + 96 x 1 + 80 x 1 + 16 x 6 + 53 x 2\n    which is 417 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 418. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 0, 2, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 1, 4, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 0, 3, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 3, 0, 3, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "I'll analyze this negotiation step by step to determine the best action.\n\n## 1) Current Situation Analysis\n\n- My outside offer value: 418\n- My item values:\n  - Item 1: 39 per unit (2 units total)\n  - Item 2: 96 per unit (3 units total)\n  - Item 3: 80 per unit (2 units total)\n  - Item 4: 16 per unit (6 units total)\n  - Item 5: 53 per unit (4 units total)\n- Current round: 2 (discount factor would be \u03b3^1 = 0.98 if I accept now)\n- Player 1's current offer to me: [1, 3, 0, 3, 1]\n\n## 2) Value Assessment\n\n### Value of Player 1's current offer to me:\n- Item 1: 1 \u00d7 39 = 39\n- Item 2: 3 \u00d7 96 = 288\n- Item 3: 0 \u00d7 80 = 0\n- Item 4: 3 \u00d7 16 = 48\n- Item 5: 1 \u00d7 53 = 53\n- Total value = 428\n- Discounted value (round 2) = 428 \u00d7 0.98 = 419.44\n\nThis is better than my outside offer of 418.\n\n### My previous counteroffer [1, 1, 1, 4, 1] meant I would keep [1, 2, 1, 2, 3]:\n- Item 1: 1 \u00d7 39 = 39\n- Item 2: 2 \u00d7 96 = 192\n- Item 3: 1 \u00d7 80 = 80\n- Item 4: 2 \u00d7 16 = 32\n- Item 5: 3 \u00d7 53 = 159\n- Total value = 502\n\n### Looking at Player 1's pattern:\n- They consistently offer me all 3 units of item 2, suggesting they don't value it highly\n- They consistently offer me 0 units of item 3, suggesting they value it highly\n- They increased their offer of item 4 from 2 to 3 units\n\n## 3) Decision Making\n\nThe current offer gives me a value of 419.44 after discounting, which is slightly better than my outside offer of 418. However, we're now in round 2, so I need to consider that:\n\n1. If I reject and make a counteroffer, we'll move to round 3 (the final round)\n2. Any deal in round 3 will be further discounted by 0.98\n3. If I make a counteroffer in round 3, it will be treated as a WALK\n\nLooking at Player 1's offers, they seem to value item 3 highly and item 2 less. I can try one more reasonable counteroffer that improves my position slightly while still being acceptable to them. I'll try to keep all of item 3 and more of item 5 while giving them more of item 4 which I value less.\n\nMy counteroffer: I'll offer Player 1 [1, 1, 0, 4, 1]\nThis means I keep [1, 2, 2, 2, 3], which gives me:\n- Item 1: 1 \u00d7 39 = 39\n- Item 2: 2 \u00d7 96 = 192\n- Item 3: 2 \u00d7 80 = 160\n- Item 4: 2 \u00d7 16 = 32\n- Item 5: 3 \u00d7 53 = 159\n- Total value = 582\n\nThis is significantly better than my outside offer, though it will be discounted in round 3 if accepted.\n\nHowever, I must also consider the risk that Player 1 might walk away in round 3. Given that their current offer of [1, 3, 0, 3, 1] is already acceptable to me (value of 419.44 > outside offer of 418), the safer choice might be to accept their current offer.\n\nComparing options:\n1. Accept now: 419.44 (guaranteed)\n2. Counteroffer and hope for acceptance: Higher potential but risk of WALK\n3. Outside offer: 418\n\nSince the current offer is already better than my outside offer, and we're in the second-to-last round, I'll accept.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

Looking at my values:\n- Item 1 is very valuable (88/unit)\n- Item 2 is very valuable (85/unit)\n- Item 3 is valuable (65/unit)\n- Item 4 is valuable (75/unit)\n- Item 5 is nearly worthless to me (1/unit)\n\nBased on their offer, Player 1 seems willing to give me items 1, 2, and 3, which are valuable to me. They kept all of item 4, which might be valuable to them. They also kept most of item 5, which is almost worthless to me.\n\nLet me try a counteroffer where I propose giving them:\n- 1 unit of item 1 (keeping 3)\n- 0 units of item 2 (keeping 1)\n- 1 unit of item 3 (keeping 3)\n- 0 units of item 4 (keeping 1)\n- 5 units of item 5 (keeping 1)\n\nLet me calculate the value of what I'd keep:\n- 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264\n- 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 85 = 85\n- 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195\n- 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 75 = 75\n- 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 1 = 1\n\nTotal value to me: 620, which is greater than my outside offer of 533.\n\n## 4) Decision\n\nThe current offer is worth 304 to me, which is less than my outside offer of 533.\nMy proposed counteroffer would be worth 620 to me, which is better than my outside offer.\nThis is round 1, so I should make a counteroffer rather than walking away.\n\nI'll propose giving Player 1: [1, 0, 1, 0, 5]\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 0, 5]}",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 527. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 527. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 936 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 1, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    67 x 0 + 43 x 0 + 48 x 0 + 61 x 1 + 93 x 5\n    which is 526 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 527. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 2, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 1, 0, 5]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 1, 0, 5]\n\n    What is your action?

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 527. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 936 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 1, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    67 x 0 + 43 x 0 + 48 x 0 + 61 x 1 + 93 x 5\n    which is 526 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 527. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 2, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 1, 0, 5]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 3, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 2, 0, 5]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 2, 0, 5]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "I need to carefully evaluate the current situation to make the best decision for round 3, which is the final round.\n\n1) Analyzing the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 527\n   - My item values: Item 1 = 67, Item 2 = 43, Item 3 = 48, Item 4 = 61, Item 5 = 93\n   - Total pool: 4 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 6 units of item 5\n   - Since this is round 3, if I accept an offer, the discount factor is 0.98\u00b2 = 0.9604\n\n2) Assessing the value of the current offer:\n   Player 2 is offering me [1, 0, 2, 0, 5] and keeping [3, 1, 2, 1, 1] for themselves.\n   \n   My value if I accept:\n   - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 67 = 67\n   - 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 43 = 0\n   - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 48 = 96\n   - 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 61 = 0\n   - 5 units of item 5 = 5 \u00d7 93 = 465\n   \n   Total value = 628\n   With discount: 628 \u00d7 0.9604 = 603.13\n\n   This is higher than my outside offer of 527.\n\n3) Looking at Player 2's offers and potential counteroffers:\n   Player 2's offers so far:\n   - First offer: [1, 0, 1, 0, 5] (keeping most of items 2, 3, 4 but giving most of item 5)\n   - Second offer: [1, 0, 2, 0, 5] (similar pattern but giving one more of item 3)\n   \n   From this pattern, it seems Player 2 values items 2 and 4 highly, moderately values item 1, and doesn't value item 5 as much.\n\n   Since this is the final round, and Player 2's last action would be treated as a WALK if they counteroffer, I need to be careful with my decision:\n   \n   - If I make a counteroffer, Player 2 will either ACCEPT or effectively WALK\n   - If I make a counteroffer that's too aggressive, Player 2 might walk and I'll only get my outside offer of 527\n   - The current offer gives me a value of 603.13, which is better than my outside offer\n\n4) Decision making:\n   Since the current offer (603.13 with discount) is better than my outside offer (527), and this is the final round where any counteroffer by Player 2 would be treated as a WALK, the most rational choice is to accept the current offer.\n\n   If I were to make a counteroffer, I would risk Player 2 walking away, which would result in me getting only my outside offer. Since the current offer is already better than my outside offer, accepting is the safer and more profitable option.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 199. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 199. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 609 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 4, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    87 x 0 + 48 x 0 + 14 x 1 + 46 x 4 + 8 x 0\n    which is 198 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 199.

Current Situation Analysis\n- My outside offer value: 199\n- My item values:\n  - Item 1: 87 per unit (3 units available)\n  - Item 2: 48 per unit (0 units available)\n  - Item 3: 14 per unit (4 units available)\n  - Item 4: 46 per unit (4 units available)\n  - Item 5: 8 per unit (1 unit available)\n- Total pool: [3,0,4,4,1]\n- Discount factor: 0.98 (meaning offers become less valuable in later rounds)\n\n### 2. Calculating Maximum Possible Value\nIf I kept all items, my total value would be:\n- 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 87 = 261\n- 0 units of item 2: 0 \u00d7 48 = 0\n- 4 units of item 3: 4 \u00d7 14 = 56\n- 4 units of item 4: 4 \u00d7 46 = 184\n- 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 8 = 8\nTotal maximum value: 509\n\n### 3. Strategic Counteroffer Calculation\nI need to create an offer that maximizes my value while still being potentially acceptable to Player 2.\n\nLooking at my item values, I should prioritize keeping:\n- Item 1 (highest value at 87 per unit)\n- Item 4 (moderate value at 46 per unit)\n- Items 3 and 5 have lower value to me, so I can offer more of these\n\nA potential offer to Player 2 could be:\n- Item 1: 0 units (keeping all 3)\n- Item 2: 0 units (none available)\n- Item 3: 3 units (keeping 1)\n- Item 4: 1 unit (keeping 3)\n- Item 5: 1 unit (keeping 0)\n\nMy value if this offer is accepted:\n- 3 \u00d7 87 + 0 \u00d7 48 + 1 \u00d7 14 + 3 \u00d7 46 + 0 \u00d7 8 = 261 + 0 + 14 + 138 + 0 = 413\n\nThis is well above my outside offer of 199, so it's a good starting point.\n\n### 4. Decision Making\nSince this is the first round, I should make a strong initial offer that favors me while leaving some room for negotiation. The offer [0,0,3,1,1] keeps my highest-value items (all of item 1 and most of item 4) while offering Player 2 items that are less valuable to me.\n\nThis offer gives me a value of 413, which is significantly better than my outside offer of 199.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 199. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 609 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 4, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    87 x 0 + 48 x 0 + 14 x 1 + 46 x 4 + 8 x 0\n    which is 198 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 199. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 3, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 0, 3, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 0, 3, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "I need to analyze the current situation and determine my best course of action.\n\n### 1) Current Situation Analysis:\n- My outside offer value: 199\n- My item values: 87 for item 1, 48 for item 2, 14 for item 3, 46 for item 4, 8 for item 5\n- Total pool: 3 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 1 units of item 5\n- Discount factor: 0.98 (since we're in round 2, any outcome will be multiplied by 0.98)\n\n### 2) Value Assessment:\n\n**Current offer from Player 2 (what I would get)**: [2, 0, 3, 1, 0]\nValue to me:\n- 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 87 = 174\n- 0 units of item 2: 0 \u00d7 48 = 0\n- 3 units of item 3: 3 \u00d7 14 = 42\n- 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 46 = 46\n- 0 units of item 5: 0 \u00d7 8 = 0\nTotal value: 174 + 0 + 42 + 46 + 0 = 262\n\nWith discount factor: 262 \u00d7 0.98 = 256.76\n\nThis is better than my outside offer of 199.\n\n### 3) Decision Analysis:\n\nPlayer 2's offers suggest they may value item 1 less (they offered me 2 out of 3 units), item 3 less (they offered me 3 out of 4 units), but they seem to value item 4 (only offering me 1 out of 4 units) and item 5 (keeping the 1 unit).\n\nI previously offered them [0, 0, 3, 1, 1] which gave me a value of:\n- 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 87 = 261\n- 0 units of item 2: 0 \u00d7 48 = 0\n- 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 14 = 14\n- 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 46 = 138\n- 0 units of item 5: 0 \u00d7 8 = 0\nTotal value to me: 261 + 0 + 14 + 138 + 0 = 413\n\nTheir counteroffer is less valuable to me (262 vs. 413).\n\nLet me propose a counteroffer that's better than their offer but still fair. \n\nI value item 1 highly (87), while they seem willing to give some of it up. I also value item 4 (46), which they want to keep more of. Item 3 has low value to me (14), and they seem willing to give it up.\n\nLet's try: [1, 0, 3, 2, 1]\nThis gives me:\n- 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 87 = 174\n- 0 units of item 2: 0 \u00d7 48 = 0\n- 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 14 = 14\n- 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 46 = 92\n- 0 units of item 5: 0 \u00d7 8 = 0\nTotal value to me: 174 + 0 + 14 + 92 + 0 = 280\n\n280 \u00d7 0.98 = 274.4, which is still better than my outside offer.\n\nHowever, their current offer is also quite good for me at 256.76. Given that we're in round 2 and accepting would end the negotiation with a good outcome, accepting might be the wisest choice rather than risking them walking away if I counter with something they don't like.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I'm going to ACCEPT their current offer because:\n1. It provides me with a value (256.76) that's significantly better than my outside offer (199).\n2. We're already in round 2, so further delays risk additional discounting.\n3. Their offer suggests they value items that I don't value as much, creating a mutually beneficial trade.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 4, 0, 5, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    53 x 4 + 9 x 4 + 86 x 0 + 79 x 5 + 35 x 0\n    which is 643 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 649. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 3, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 3, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "I need to carefully analyze the current offer and determine the best course of action.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the current situation\n\n- My outside offer value: 649\n- My values per unit: item 1 = 53, item 2 = 9, item 3 = 86, item 4 = 79, item 5 = 35\n- Total pool of items: 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5\n- Discount factor: 0.98 (affects future rounds)\n\n### Step 2: Assess the value of the current offer\n\nThe current offer from Player 1 gives me:\n- 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 53 = 53\n- 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 9 = 9\n- 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 86 = 86\n- 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237\n- 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 35 = 70\n\nTotal value of this offer to me: 53 + 9 + 86 + 237 + 70 = 455\n\nThis is significantly less than my outside offer of 649, so I should not accept this offer.\n\n### Step 3: Plan my counteroffer\n\nI need to propose an offer that gives me a value greater than my outside offer of 649, while still being potentially acceptable to Player 1.\n\nLet me calculate what I would receive with different counteroffers:\n\nIf I offer Player 1 [1, 3, 0, 2, 0] (keeping [3, 1, 1, 3, 2] for myself):\n- 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159\n- 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 9 = 9\n- 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 86 = 86\n- 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237\n- 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 35 = 70\n\nTotal value to me: 159 + 9 + 86 + 237 + 70 = 561\n\nThis is less than my outside offer of 649, so I need to keep more items.\n\nIf I offer Player 1 [0, 3, 0, 1, 0] (keeping [4, 1, 1, 4, 2] for myself):\n- 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 53 = 212\n- 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 9 = 9\n- 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 86 = 86\n- 4 units of item 4 = 4 \u00d7 79 = 316\n- 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 35 = 70\n\nTotal value to me: 212 + 9 + 86 + 316 + 70 = 693\n\nThis is greater than my outside offer of 649, so this is a viable counteroffer.\n\nBased on Player 1's first offer, they seem to value items 4 and 5 (they offered more of these to me), while wanting to keep more of items 1 and 2. I'll offer them more of item 2 which is low value to me (9 per unit), and keep more of the items that are high value to me (items 1, 3, and 4).\n\n### Step 4: Decision\n\nI will make a counteroffer of [0, 3, 0, 1, 0], which means I'm offering Player 1 0 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n\nThis gives me a value of 693, which is better than my outside offer of 649.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 0, 1, 0]}",

There's a risk Player 2 might walk away if I push too hard, and we're already in round 2 with further discounting ahead if negotiations continue.\n\nSince Player 2's offer (449.82) is already significantly better than my outside offer (371), and only marginally worse than my potential counteroffer, I should accept their offer to secure this value.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

I need to make the first offer.\n\nLet me calculate the value of keeping all items myself:\n- 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 17 = 68\n- 4 units of item 2 = 4 \u00d7 61 = 244\n- 5 units of item 3 = 5 \u00d7 75 = 375\n- 5 units of item 4 = 5 \u00d7 70 = 350\n- 8 units of item 5 = 8 \u00d7 83 = 664\nTotal value = 1701\n\nStrategically, I should offer items that have lower value to me, keeping the high-value items. \n\nI notice that Item 1 has the lowest value for me (17 per unit). I'll offer more of those.\nItem 5 has the highest value (83 per unit), so I'll keep most of those.\n\nLet's try offering:\n- 3 units of item 1 (keeping 1)\n- 1 unit of item 2 (keeping 3)\n- 1 unit of item 3 (keeping 4)\n- 1 unit of item 4 (keeping 4)\n- 2 units of item 5 (keeping 6)\n\nMy value for this would be:\n- 1 \u00d7 17 = 17\n- 3 \u00d7 61 = 183\n- 4 \u00d7 75 = 300\n- 4 \u00d7 70 = 280\n- 6 \u00d7 83 = 498\nTotal = 1278\n\nThis is below my outside offer of 1461, so I need to keep more items.\n\nLet's try a different split:\n- 1 unit of item 1 (keeping 3)\n- 1 unit of item 2 (keeping 3)\n- 1 unit of item 3 (keeping 4)\n- 1 unit of item 4 (keeping 4)\n- 1 unit of item 5 (keeping 7)\n\nMy value:\n- 3 \u00d7 17 = 51\n- 3 \u00d7 61 = 183\n- 4 \u00d7 75 = 300\n- 4 \u00d7 70 = 280\n- 7 \u00d7 83 = 581\nTotal = 1395\n\nStill below my outside offer of 1461.\n\nLet me try again with fewer units offered:\n- 1 unit of item 1 (keeping 3)\n- 0 units of item 2 (keeping 4)\n- 1 unit of item 3 (keeping 4)\n- 1 unit of item 4 (keeping 4)\n- 0 units of item 5 (keeping 8)\n\nMy value:\n- 3 \u00d7 17 = 51\n- 4 \u00d7 61 = 244\n- 4 \u00d7 75 = 300\n- 4 \u00d7 70 = 280\n- 8 \u00d7 83 = 664\nTotal = 1539\n\nThis exceeds my outside offer of 1461, so it's acceptable.\n\n### 3) Decision:\nSince this is the first round, I want to start with a strategic offer that gives me good value while still being potentially acceptable to Player 2. I'll offer a small portion of each item type (except Items 2 and 5 which have high value to me).\n\nMy offer to Player 2 will be: [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]\n\nThis keeps me well above my outside offer value (1539 > 1461) while offering something to the other player that they might accept if our valuations differ significantly.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]}",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 1158. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1158. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 993 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 4, 5, 1, 8] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    78 x 0 + 47 x 4 + 63 x 5 + 70 x 1 + 73 x 8\n    which is 1157 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1158. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1) Current situation:\n   - My outside offer value: 1461\n   - My item values: item 1 = 17, item 2 = 61, item 3 = 75, item 4 = 70, item 5 = 83\n   - Total pool: 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 8 units of item 5\n   - Discount factor: 0.98 (We're in round 2, so future outcomes will be discounted by 0.98)\n\n2) Assessing the current offer from Player 2:\n   If I accept Player 2's offer, I would receive [2, 0, 2, 1, 1], meaning I keep [2, 4, 3, 4, 7].\n   My value would be:\n   - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 17 = 34\n   - 4 units of item 2 = 4 \u00d7 61 = 244\n   - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225\n   - 4 units of item 4 = 4 \u00d7 70 = 280\n   - 7 units of item 5 = 7 \u00d7 83 = 581\n   Total value = 1364\n\n   This is less than my outside offer of 1461, so accepting would be a mistake.\n\n3) Assessing potential counteroffers:\n   Let me try to craft a counteroffer that balances what's valuable to me with what might be acceptable to Player 2.\n   \n   Based on Player 2's offer, they seem to value item 1 and item 3 more than I do, while they're willing to give up item 2 and item 4.\n   \n   Let's try a counteroffer where I keep more of the higher-value items (2, 4, and 5) and offer more of items 1 and 3:\n   \n   Counteroffer [2, 0, 2, 1, 1] (meaning I keep [2, 4, 3, 4, 7])\n   My value would be:\n   - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 17 = 34\n   - 4 units of item 2 = 4 \u00d7 61 = 244\n   - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225\n   - 4 units of item 4 = 4 \u00d7 70 = 280\n   - 7 units of item 5 = 7 \u00d7 83 = 581\n   Total value = 1364\n\n   This is less than my outside offer, so let me adjust.\n   \n   Let's try [1, 0, 2, 1, 0] (meaning I keep [3, 4, 3, 4, 8])\n   My value would be:\n   - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51\n   - 4 units of item 2 = 4 \u00d7 61 = 244\n   - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225\n   - 4 units of item 4 = 4 \u00d7 70 = 280\n   - 8 units of item 5 = 8 \u00d7 83 = 664\n   Total value = 1464\n\n   This exceeds my outside offer of 1461, so it's a viable counteroffer.\n\nLooking at Player 2's behavior, they seem to value items 1 and 3 more than others, while being willing to give up items 2, 4, and 5. My counteroffer [1, 0, 2, 1, 0] keeps the most valuable items for me while offering items that seem to matter to Player 2.\n\nSince we're in round 2, if we reach a deal next round, it will be discounted by 0.98. The current outside offer value of 1461 would beat any accepted deal worth less than approximately 1491 in the next round, so it's important to make a strong offer now.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 2, 1, 0]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1158. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 993 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 4, 5, 1, 8] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    78 x 0 + 47 x 4 + 63 x 5 + 70 x 1 + 73 x 8\n    which is 1157 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1158. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 0, 2, 1, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 2, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 2, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 0, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    3 x 2 + 87 x 0 + 5 x 0 + 68 x 1 + 47 x 1\n    which is 121 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 122. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [5, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [5, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

I should keep more of the high-value items (items 2 and 4) for myself while offering more of the low-value items (items 1 and 3).\n\nIf I offer Player 1:\n- 5 units of item 1 (keeping 1): 1 \u00d7 3 = 3 value for me\n- 1 unit of item 2 (keeping 3): 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 value for me\n- 3 units of item 3 (keeping 1): 1 \u00d7 5 = 5 value for me\n- 1 unit of item 4 (keeping 2): 2 \u00d7 68 = 136 value for me\n- 1 unit of item 5 (keeping 1): 1 \u00d7 47 = 47 value for me\n\nTotal value of this counteroffer for me: 3 + 261 + 5 + 136 + 47 = 452\nThis is significantly better than my outside offer of 122 and also better than accepting their current offer.\n\n## Step 4: Make a decision\n\nGiven the analysis:\n1. The current offer (222) is better than my outside option (122)\n2. I can propose a counteroffer that's even better for me (452)\n3. This is only round 1, so I have room to negotiate\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that keeps most of the items I value highly (items 2 and 4) while giving Player 1 more of the items I value less (items 1 and 3).\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [5, 1, 3, 1, 1]}",

                    "response": "Let me analyze this negotiation situation step-by-step:\n\n1) Current situation:\n   - My outside offer value: 122\n   - My item values: Item 1 = 3, Item 2 = 87, Item 3 = 5, Item 4 = 68, Item 5 = 47\n   - Total pool: 6 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5\n   - Discount factor: \u03b3 = 0.98 (we're in round 2, so discount would be 0.98^1 = 0.98)\n\n2) Value assessment:\n   \n   Current offer from Player 1 gives me: [1, 3, 2, 2, 1] (what I would keep)\n   Value calculation:\n   - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 3 = 3\n   - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261\n   - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 5 = 10\n   - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 68 = 136\n   - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 47 = 47\n   Total value = 457 \u00d7 0.98 = 447.86\n\n   This is significantly higher than my outside offer of 122.\n\n3) Looking at previous offers:\n   - I previously offered Player 1 [5, 1, 3, 1, 1], keeping [1, 3, 1, 2, 1] for myself = 3 + 261 + 5 + 136 + 47 = 452\n   - Player 1's first offer gave me [1, 3, 3, 2, 1] = 3 + 261 + 15 + 136 + 47 = 462\n   - Player 1's latest offer gives me [1, 3, 2, 2, 1] = 3 + 261 + 10 + 136 + 47 = 457\n\n4) Analysis of Player 1's preferences:\n   - They consistently offer me most of item 2 (keeping only 1 unit) - this suggests they don't value item 2 much\n   - They offered me less of item 3 this round (2 instead of 3) - they may value item 3 somewhat\n   - They consistently keep most of item 1 (5 units) - they likely value item 1 highly\n\nThe current offer provides me with a value of 457, which is much better than my outside offer of 122. While slightly worse than Player 1's original offer (462), it's still an excellent deal for me.\n\nSince we're in round 2 of 3, if I counter-offer, there's a risk Player 1 might walk away in the final round. The current offer is already very favorable to me, giving me items I value highly (especially item 2).\n\nGiven that:\n1. The current offer is worth 457 points to me (447.86 with discount)\n2. This is significantly above my outside offer of 122\n3. We're already in round 2\n4. The offer gives me most of my high-value items\n\nI will accept this offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",
