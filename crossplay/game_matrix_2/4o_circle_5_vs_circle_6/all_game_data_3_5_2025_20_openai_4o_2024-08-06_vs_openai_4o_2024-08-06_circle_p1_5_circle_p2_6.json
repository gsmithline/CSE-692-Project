The longer the negotiation proceeds, the less valuable the agreement becomes to both parties due to this discounting.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the value of offers\n\n1. **Current offer**: [1, 1, 1, 2, 2] is what Player 1 is offering.\n   - Value of current offer:\n     - 1 unit of Item 1: 1 x 28 = 28\n     - 1 unit of Item 2: 1 x 92 = 92\n     - 1 unit of Item 3: 1 x 100 = 100\n     - 2 units of Item 4: 2 x 70 = 140\n     - 2 units of Item 5: 2 x 53 = 106\n   - Total value = 28 + 92 + 100 + 140 + 106 = 466\n\n2. **Comparison with outside offer**: My outside offer is 253. The current offer is worth 466, which is significantly higher than my outside offer.\n\n### Step 3: Make a decision\n\n1. **Should I accept the current offer?** Yes, because the current offer's value (466) is greater than my outside offer (253) and it's unlikely that waiting or making a counteroffer would lead to a better deal given the discount factor and the values.\n\n2. **Avoiding mistakes**: \n   - Mistake 4 and Mistake 5 would be committed if I reject an offer better than my outside offer, leading to a lower value for me.\n\nGiven this analysis, the best action is to accept the current offer, as it provides a value significantly greater than my outside option.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 2, 7, 2, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    94 x 4 + 75 x 2 + 25 x 7 + 100 x 2 + 89 x 0\n    which is 901 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 902. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

If I accept an offer in round 2, the value is multiplied by \\(\\gamma^1 = 0.98\\). In round 3, this factor would become \\(\\gamma^2\\), further reducing the effective value. Thus, accepting earlier offers can be more favorable compared to waiting, as long as they are beneficial enough.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer:**\n  You are being offered [5, 3, 6, 0, 3]. Calculate my value if I accept:\n  - 5 units of item 1 = 5 \u00d7 92 = 460\n  - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213\n  - 6 units of item 3 = 6 \u00d7 16 = 96\n  - 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 43 = 0\n  - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87\n  - Total = 856\n\n  Discounted by \\(\\gamma^1\\), the value is 856 \u00d7 0.98 = 839.88\n\n- **Compare with my outside offer:**\n  My outside offer is 754. The current offer gives me a value of 839.88 after applying the discount factor, which is higher than 754.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision Based on the Analysis\n\n- **Should I accept the current offer?**  \n  Yes, because the current offer of 839.88 is better than my outside offer (754).\n\n- **Should I walk away?**  \n  No, walking away would result in a value equal to my outside offer (754), which is lower than accepting the current offer.\n\n- **Should I propose a specific counteroffer?**  \n  Since the current offer already provides a higher value than my outside offer and counteroffers in the last round are treated as walking away, a counteroffer is not the best choice.\n\nGiven this evaluation, the best course of action is to accept the current offer. \n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 278. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 171 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 3, 5, 2, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    3 x 1 + 5 x 3 + 19 x 5 + 4 x 2 + 26 x 6\n    which is 277 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 278. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To analyze the current situation and make an informed decision, let's step through the questions:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is **278**.\n   - My private values for the items are:\n     - Item 1: 3\n     - Item 2: 5\n     - Item 3: 19\n     - Item 4: 4\n     - Item 5: 26\n   - The total pool of items is: \n     - 2 units of item 1\n     - 6 units of item 2\n     - 5 units of item 3\n     - 3 units of item 4\n     - 6 units of item 5 \n   - The discount factor of 0.98 slightly decreases the value of accepting future offers. However, since this is round 1, it is not as influential as later rounds unless the negotiation drags on.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - There is no current offer to evaluate.\n   - I need to propose a counteroffer that has a total value greater than 278 to avoid Mistake 2 and ensure the action is justified as beneficial compared to my outside offer. Let's consider an initial offer that balances my interest:\n\n     One possible offer could be to keep higher-value items for myself, maximizing my total value:\n     - Keep 0 units of item 1\n     - Keep 0 units of item 2\n     - Keep 5 units of item 3\n     - Keep 0 units of item 4\n     - Keep 6 units of item 5\n\n   Calculating the total value if I make this offer to Player 2:\n   - Value from item 1: 0 * 3 = 0\n   - Value from item 2: 0 * 5 = 0\n   - Value from item 3: 5 * 19 = 95\n   - Value from item 4: 0 * 4 = 0\n   - Value from item 5: 6 * 26 = 156\n   - Total value = 95 + 156 = 251\n\n   The value of this offer, 251, is below the outside offer of 278. It demonstrates a mismatch with my fallback option, and therefore this cannot be my counteroffer.\n\n   Let's improve this by reassessing what I keep:\n   - Keep 2 units of item 1\n   - Keep 0 units of item 2\n   - Keep 5 units of item 3\n   - Keep 3 units of item 4\n   - Keep 1 unit of item 5\n\n   Calculating the total value if I make this new offer to Player 2:\n   - Value from item 1: 2 * 3 = 6\n   - Value from item 2: 0 * 5 = 0\n   - Value from item 3: 5 * 19 = 95\n   - Value from item 4: 3 * 4 = 12\n   - Value from item 5: 1 * 26 = 26\n   - Total value = 6 + 0 + 95 + 12 + 26 = 139\n\n   Assigning another value, keeping higher in the item count from the beginning offers constructive components, but still remains subpar. Let's retry:\n   - Keep 2 units of item 1\n   - Keep 0 units of item 2\n   - Keep 5 units of item 3\n   - Keep 2 units of item 4\n   - Keep 3 units of item 5\n\n   Calculating:\n   - Value from item 1: 2 * 3 = 6\n   - Value from item 2: 0 * 5 = 0\n   - Value from item 3: 5 * 19 = 95\n   - Value from item 4: 2 * 4 = 8\n   - Value from item 5: 3 * 26 = 78\n\n  Total = 6 + 0 + 95 + 8 + 78 = 187\n\nAdditionally, another combination considering balance:\n   - Keep 0 units of item 1\n   - Keep 3 units of item 2\n   - Keep 5 units of item 3\n   - Keep 3 units of item 4\n   - Keep 3 units of item 5\n\n   Calculating:\n   - Value from item 1: 0 * 3 = 0\n   - Value from item 2: 3 * 5 = 15\n   - Value from item 3: 5 * 19 = 95\n   - Value from item 4: 3 * 4 = 12\n   - Value from item 5: 3 * 26 = 78\n\n   Total = 0 + 15 + 114 + 12 + 78 = 219\n\nHowever, balance still needs correction, resulting a taking forth examining:\n - Keep 2 units of item 1\n - Keep 6 units of item 2\n - Keep 5 units of item 3\n - Keep 3 units of item 4\n - Keep 2 units of item 5\n\n   Calculating:\n   - Value from item 1: 2 * 3 = 6\n   - Value from item 2: 6 * 5 = 30\n   - Value from item 3: 5 * 19 = 95\n   - Value from item 4: 3 * 4 = 12\n   - Value from item 5: 2 * 26 = 52\n \n   Total value = 6 + 30 + 95 + 12 + 52 = 195\n\nEvaluating a final alternative to check balance:\n - Keep 1 unit of item 1\n - Keep 0 units of item 2\n - Keep 5 units of item 3\n - Keep 3 units of item 4\n - Keep 6 units of item 5\n\n   Calculating:\n   - Value from item 1: 1 * 3 = 3\n   - Value from item 2: 0 * 5 = 0\n   - Value from item 3: 5 * 19 = 95\n   - Value from item 4: 3 * 4 = 12\n   - Value from item 5: 6 * 26 = 156\n\n   Total value = 3 + 0 + 190 + 12 + 156 = 261\n\nThis offer introduces advantageous proceedings onslaught the moment, still remains the better nearest option is secured.\n\nConclusion: Current culmination akin below equals 278 value. Adhering to ultimate improvement unsorted discourse. Therefore, a more optimal contemplation must greet: \n\n - **Decision & Action:**\n     - Succeeding present intention: fortitude particulars engaged where contingencies apply, therefore NEGOCIATE concluded proven actionable further to prevent exacerbated distances or interests.\n       - Henced upon centralization strength, adhere until better element arrises.   \n\n   {\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

If the negotiation extends to more rounds, the overall value of the outcome decreases due to this factor. Therefore, resolving the negotiation sooner rather than later is preferable in terms of maximizing value.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer**: There is no current offer on the table, so I must make an initial offer.\n- **Potential Counteroffers**: I need to assess what kind of division I can propose that maximizes my value.\n  - I will calculate a division where I keep all items initially and see if it maximizes my value:\n    - Value if I propose keeping everything for myself:\n      \\[\n      2 \\times 56 + 4 \\times 52 + 3 \\times 90 + 2 \\times 96 + 4 \\times 56 = 112 + 208 + 270 + 192 + 224 = 1006\n      \\]\n    - This value is much higher than my outside offer of 8.\n    - Based on negotiation strategies and fairness, a balanced initial offer might involve keeping the higher valued items regarding my perceived value.\n    - Let's examine a balanced scenario: I keep 1 unit of Item 1, 2 units of Item 2, 2 units of Item 3, 1 unit of Item 4, and 2 units of Item 5.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 4, 2, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    78 x 0 + 1 x 4 + 24 x 2 + 23 x 0 + 86 x 1\n    which is 138 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 142. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 1, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 1, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Step 1: Analyze the current situation\n\n- My outside offer value is 142.\n- The values of the items to me are:\n  - Item 1: 78 per unit\n  - Item 2: 1 per unit\n  - Item 3: 24 per unit\n  - Item 4: 23 per unit\n  - Item 5: 86 per unit\n  \n- The total pool of items is:\n  - Item 1: 2 units\n  - Item 2: 4 units\n  - Item 3: 3 units\n  - Item 4: 2 units\n  - Item 5: 4 units\n\n- The discount factor, gamma = 0.98, affects how the value of the negotiation decreases over rounds. As it is round 1, the impact of the discount is negligible.\n\nStep 2: Assess the value of offers\n\n- Current offer from Player 1: [1, 2, 1, 1, 2] (what is being offered to me).\n  - Value calculation for current offer if I accept:\n    - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 78 = 78\n    - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 1 = 2\n    - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 24 = 24\n    - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 23 = 23\n    - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 86 = 172\n  - Total value = 78 + 2 + 24 + 23 + 172 = 299\n\n- The value of accepting the current offer, 299, is significantly higher than my outside offer of 142.\n\nStep 3: Make a decision based on the analysis\n\n- The current offer yields a value of 299 to me, which is clearly higher than my outside offer of 142.\n- Accepting an offer that yields a payoff higher than my outside offer is a sound strategy as per the guidelines provided and avoids any avoidable mistakes such as walking away from a better offer.\n\nTherefore, the optimal action is to:\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

This discount factor will reduce the value of offers in future rounds (though less relevant in round 1).\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers\n- There is currently no offer on the table to accept or analyze.\n- Instead, I need to formulate the initial offer.\n\n### Potential Counteroffers\nTo formulate a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer, I should ensure that the total value of the items I keep exceeds 863. I will iterate possible divisions to find one that maximizes my payoff while still being better than my outside offer.\n\nLet's consider keeping the following items:\n- 3 units of Item 1: 3 x 89 = 267\n- 5 units of Item 2 (all): 5 x 3 = 15\n- 3 units of Item 3: 3 x 57 = 171\n- 3 units of Item 4: 3 x 87 = 261\n- 2 units of Item 5: 2 x 47 = 94\n\nFor Player 2, this proposed counteroffer would be:\n- 0 units of Item 1 \n- 0 units of Item 2 \n- 1 unit of Item 3\n- 1 unit of Item 4\n- 1 unit of Item 5\n\nTotal Value to Me with this offer = 267 + 15 + 171 + 261 + 94 = 808\n\nSince the calculated value is less than my outside offer, I have to adjust the proposed division further. Let's retain the full value of items giving a total value over my outside offer:\n\nLet's instead keep:\n- 3 units of Item 1\n- 5 units of Item 2\n- 4 units of Item 3\n- 3 units of Item 4\n- 1 unit of Item 5\n\nFor Player 2, offering them:\n- 0 units of Item 1 \n- 0 units of Item 2 \n- 0 units of Item 3\n- 1 unit of Item 4\n- 2 units of Item 5\n\nRecalculated:\n- My Value = 3x89 + 5x3 + 4x57 + 3x87 + 1x47 = 267 + 15 + 228 + 261 + 47 = 818.\n\nAgain, still not optimal. Adjusting again:\n- 3 units of Item 1\n- 5 units of Item 2\n- 4 units of Item 3\n- 3 units of Item 4\n- 2 units of Item 5\n\nPlayer 2 offer would be:\n- 0 units of Item 1\n- 0 of Item 2\n- 0 of Item 3\n- 1 units of Item 4\n- 1 units of Item 5\n\nRecalculated:\n- My Value = 3*89 + 5*3 + 4*57 + 3*87 + 2*47 = 267 + 15 + 228 + 261 + 94 = 865.\n\nThis exceeds my outside offer of 863 and provides maximum utility.

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 863. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 863. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 849 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 4, 4, 3, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    89 x 3 + 3 x 4 + 57 x 4 + 87 x 3 + 47 x 2\n    which is 862 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 863. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 2, 2, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 2, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Let's evaluate potential offers based on keeping a certain number of units of each item:\n\n   - If I keep all of one item, my value would be calculated as:\n     - Keeping all of item 1: 9 * 59 = 531\n     - Keeping all of item 2: 2 * 20 = 40\n     - Keeping all of item 3: 4 * 47 = 188\n     - Keeping all of item 4: 3 * 10 = 30\n     - Keeping all of item 5: 2 * 62 = 124\n\n   My goal is to maximize the value of items I keep while ensuring it is greater than my outside offer of 296.\n\n3) **Make a Decision:**\n\n   To ensure that my counteroffer has a value higher than my outside offer, let's devise a strategy to create a balanced offer ensuring the highest value possible for myself:\n   \n   Let's try keeping the following combination, which maximizes high value items:\n\n   - Keep 5 units of item 1 (5 * 59 = 295)\n   - Keep 0 unit of item 2 (0 * 20 = 0)\n   - Keep 4 units of item 3 (4 * 47 = 188)\n   - Keep 2 units of item 4 (2 * 10 = 20)\n   - Keep 1 unit of item 5 (1 * 62 = 62)\n\n   Total value to me = 295 + 0 + 188 + 20 + 62 = 565\n\n   This value is significantly higher than my outside offer of 296, so it aligns with ensuring a beneficial outcome for me.\n\n   Hence, the offer to Player 2 would be:\n   - [4, 2, 0, 1, 1] (which means I keep the leftover of the total that maximizes my value calculated above).\n\nGiven this analysis, I choose to counteroffer the following division:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 2, 0, 1, 1]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 625. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 483 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [9, 2, 4, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    42 x 9 + 74 x 2 + 4 x 4 + 3 x 2 + 38 x 2\n    which is 624 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 625. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [4, 2, 0, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [4, 2, 0, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "To decide the best course of action, I'll follow the structured decision-making process outlined in the scenario:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer value is 625.\n- **Values of the Items**:\n  - Item 1: 42\n  - Item 2: 74\n  - Item 3: 4\n  - Item 4: 3\n  - Item 5: 38\n- **Total Pool of Items**:\n  - Item 1: 9 units\n  - Item 2: 2 units\n  - Item 3: 4 units\n  - Item 4: 3 units\n  - Item 5: 2 units\n- **Discount Factor**: The discount factor is 0.98, which means the value of the negotiation decreases slightly with each round of negotiation.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer**: [4, 2, 0, 1, 1] means Player 1 keeps [5, 0, 4, 2, 1]. Calculating my total value if I accept:\n\n  - Item 1: 4 units \u00d7 42 = 168\n  - Item 2: 2 units \u00d7 74 = 148\n  - Item 3: 0 units \u00d7 4 = 0\n  - Item 4: 1 unit \u00d7 3 = 3\n  - Item 5: 1 unit \u00d7 38 = 38\n\n  Total Value = 168 + 148 + 0 + 3 + 38 = 357\n\n  Compare this value to my outside offer of 625. Clearly, the current offer is far worse than my outside offer.\n\n- **Potential Counteroffers**: I need to propose a counteroffer that is worth more than my outside offer of 625. For example, if I keep [9, 2, 4, 2, 2]:\n\n  - Item 1: 9 units \u00d7 42 = 378\n  - Item 2: 2 units \u00d7 74 = 148\n  - Item 3: 4 units \u00d7 4 = 16\n  - Item 4: 2 units \u00d7 3 = 6\n  - Item 5: 2 units \u00d7 38 = 76\n\n  Total Value = 378 + 148 + 16 + 6 + 76 = 624, which is less than my outside offer. Therefore, I need to adjust the counteroffer to maintain or exceed my outside offer value.\n\n  A possible counteroffer could be to give Player 1 minimal items that don't exceed my outside offer. Let's try giving Player 1: [0, 0, 2, 1, 1]:\n\n  I'll keep [9, 2, 2, 2, 1]:\n\n  - Item 1: 9 units \u00d7 42 = 378\n  - Item 2: 2 units \u00d7 74 = 148\n  - Item 3: 2 units \u00d7 4 = 8\n  - Item 4: 2 units \u00d7 3 = 6\n  - Item 5: 1 unit \u00d7 38 = 38\n\n  Total Value = 378 + 148 + 8 + 6 + 38 = 578, which is still less than my outside offer of 625.\n\n  Let's try giving Player 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], keeping everything for myself.\n\n  Total Value = 378 + 148 + 16 + 9 + 76 = 627, which exceeds my outside offer slightly.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nSince the current offer from Player 1 is worth significantly less than my outside offer, accepting it would not be a sensible choice. Additionally, I have calculated a self-advantageous counteroffer that slightly exceeds my outside offer, meaning my optimal strategy here is to go with that counteroffer.\n\nTherefore, my action is to make the following counteroffer, based on keeping everything for myself:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 4, 3, 2]}\n```",

                    "response": "To make an optimal decision, I'll proceed through the guided questions and reasoning:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **My outside offer value:**  \n  663\n\n- **Values of the items involved (value per unit * number of units available):**\n  - Item 1: 18 * 5 = 90\n  - Item 2: 32 * 4 = 128\n  - Item 3: 52 * 5 = 260\n  - Item 4: 37 * 5 = 185\n  - Item 5: 10 * 6 = 60\n\n- **Total pool of items:**\n  - 5 units of item 1\n  - 4 units of item 2\n  - 5 units of item 3\n  - 5 units of item 4\n  - 6 units of item 5\n\n- **Discount factor:** \n  Since this is round 1, if I reach a conclusion in this round, no discount applies yet. Therefore, \\(\\gamma^{0} = 1\\).\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\nThere is currently no offer to accept, so I'll evaluate potential counteroffers.\n\nTo maximize my value while also exceeding my outside offer of 663, I need to determine how to distribute the items between myself and Player 2.\n\n- Calculate my total possible value for keeping all items:\n  - \\(18 \\times 5 + 32 \\times 4 + 52 \\times 5 + 37 \\times 5 + 10 \\times 6 = 723\\)\n\nTo propose a counteroffer that gives me more than my outside offer of 663, I could offer Player 2 the minimum number of items while still retaining more than 663 in value for myself.\n\n### Calculation of a Valid Counteroffer:\nTo achieve a value slightly higher than 663, I need to let go of some items strategically:\n  \n  Let's propose giving away minimum valuable units:\n\n- Offer Player 2:\n  - 0 units of item 1\n  - 0 units of item 2\n  - 0 units of item 3\n  - 1 unit of item 4\n  - 6 units of item 5\n\nCalculate the value I get to keep:\n- Keep 5 units of item 1: \\(5 \\times 18 = 90\\)\n- Keep 4 units of item 2: \\(4 \\times 32 = 128\\)\n- Keep 5 units of item 3: \\(5 \\times 52 = 260\\)\n- Keep 4 units of item 4: \\(4 \\times 37 = 148\\)\n- Keep 0 units of item 5: \\(0 \\times 10 = 0\\)\n\nTotal = 90 + 128 + 260 + 148 + 0 = 626\n\nSince this value is lower than my outside offer, I'll iterate by offering fewer of the more valuable items:\n\n- Offer Player 2:\n  - 0 units of item 1\n  - 0 units of item 2\n  - 1 unit of item 3\n  - 2 units of item 4\n  - 6 units of item 5\n\nRecalculate:\n- Keep 5 units of item 1: \\(5 \\times 18 = 90\\)\n- Keep 4 units of item 2: \\(4 \\times 32 = 128\\)\n- Keep 4 units of item 3: \\(4 \\times 52 = 208\\)\n- Keep 3 units of item 4: \\(3 \\times 37 = 111\\)\n- Keep 0 units of item 5: \\(0 \\times 10 = 0\\)\n\nTotal = 90 + 128 + 208 + 111 + 0 = 537\n\nContinue iterating:\n\n- Offer Player 2:\n  - 0 units of item 1\n  - 0 units of item 2\n  - 0 units of item 3\n  - 3 unit of item 4\n  - 6 units of item 5\n\nRecalculate:\n- Keep 5 units of item 1: \\(5 \\times 18 = 90\\)\n- Keep 4 units of item 2: \\(4 \\times 32 = 128\\)\n- Keep 5 units of item 3: \\(5 \\times 52 = 260\\)\n- Keep 2 units of item 4: \\(2 \\times 37 = 74\\)\n- Keep 0 units of item 5: \\(0 \\times 10 = 0\\)\n\nTotal value I keep = 90 + 128 + 260 + 74 + 0 = 552\n\nThis is getting closer, but needs another iteration:\n\n- Offer Player 2 more of item 4:\n\n- Offer Player 2:\n  - 0 units of item 1\n  - 0 units of item 2\n  - 0 units of item 3\n  - 4 unit of item 4\n  - 6 units of item 5\n\nRecalculate:\n- Keep 5 units of item 1: \\(5 \\times 18 = 90\\)\n- Keep 4 units of item 2: \\(4 \\times 32 = 128\\)\n- Keep 5 units of item 3: \\(5 \\times 52 = 260\\)\n- Keep 1 units of item 4: \\(1 \\times 37 = 37\\)\n- Keep 0 units of item 5: \\(0 \\times 10 = 0\\)\n\nTotal = 90 + 128 + 260 + 37 + 0 = 515\n\nLast attempt towards adjusting values is iterating:\n\n- Offer Player 2:\n  - 0 units of item 1\n  - 1 units of item 2\n  - 0 units of item 3\n  - 4 unit of item 4\n  - 6 units of item 5\n\nRecalculate:\n- Keep 5 units of item 1: \\(5 \\times 18 = 90\\)\n- Keep 3 units of item 2: \\(3 \\times 32 = 96\\)\n- Keep 5 units of item 3: \\(5 \\times 52 = 260\\)\n- Keep 1 units of item 4: \\(1 \\times 37 = 37\\)\n- Keep 0 units of item 5: \\(0 \\times 10 = 0\\)\n\nTotal value = 90 + 96 + 260 + 37 + 0 = 483\n\nSince none of these divisions yield more than my outside offer, the economy towards maximizing value needs to be relooked at.\n\nFinally lets attempt a balance:\nOffer Player 2:\n  - 0 units of item 1\n  - 0 units of item 2\n  - 3 units of item 3\n  - 1 unit of item 4\n  - 3 units of item 5\n\nRecalculate:\n- Keep 5 units of item 1: \\(5 \\times 18 = 90\\)\n- Keep 4 units of item 2: \\(4 \\times 32 = 128\\)\n- Keep 2 units of item 3: \\(2 \\times 52 = 104\\)\n- Keep 4 units of item 4: \\(4 \\times 37 = 148\\)\n- Keep 3 units of item 5: \\(3 \\times 10 = 30\\)\n\nTotal = 90 + 128 + 104 + 148 + 30 = 500\n\nContinue towards even distribution:\nOffer Player 2:\n  - 0 units of item 1\n  - 1 units of item 2\n  - 3 units of item 3\n  - 4 unit of item 4\n  - 4 units of item 5\n\nRecalculate:\n- Keep 5 units of item 1: \\(5 \\times 18 = 90\\)\n- Keep 3 units of item 2: \\(3 \\times 32 = 96\\)\n- Keep 2 units of item 3: \\(2 \\times 52 = 104\\)\n- Keep 1 units of item 4: \\(1 \\times 37 = 37\\)\n- Keep 2 units of item 5: \\(2 \\times 10 = 20\\)\n\nTotal value = 90 + 96 + 104 + 37 + 20 = 347\n\nOffer Player 2:\n  - 1 units of item 1\n  - 3 units of item 2\n  - 3 units of item 3\n  - 2 unit of item 4\n  - 3 units of item 5\n\nRecalculate:\n- Keep 4 units of item 1: \\(4 \\times 18 = 72\\)\n- Keep 1 units of item 2: \\(1 \\times 32 = 32\\)\n- Keep 2 units of item 3: \\(2 \\times 52 = 104\\)\n- Keep 3 units of item 4: \\(3 \\times 37 = 111\\)\n- Keep 3 units of item 5: \\(3 \\times 10 = 30\\)\n\nTotal = 72 + 32 + 104 + 111 + 30 = 349\n\nEach counteroffer either keeps Player 2 below their potential value or goes above 663.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nSince a suitable higher value above 663 remains infeasible while maintaining a simple initial division:\n- handing over low-value units,\n- while also holding more than extremely valuable item ones at majority ownership,\n- possibly affects the distribution skewing towards non-optimality beyond value ceiling.\n\nWith no suitable strengthened counteroffer exceeding outside offer, the best action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 61. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 61. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 906 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    26 x 1 + 23 x 1 + 97 x 0 + 79 x 0 + 77 x 0\n    which is 49 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 61. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

This means that the value I receive will decrease slightly if the negotiation goes beyond the first round.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n\n   - There is currently no offer on the table for me to accept.\n   - I need to make an initial offer. My strategy should be to ensure the items I keep have a value greater than my outside offer of 61.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n\n   To avoid making mistakes such as mistake 2 and mistake 3, I should propose a reasonable division that ensures my value is greater than 61 without immediately being too aggressive.\n\n   Let me compute the value for a possible offer. \n\n   If I propose to Player 2 the following division: [0, 4, 1, 2, 1], meaning I keep the remaining [1, 4, 1, 2, 1], my value would be calculated as:\n\n   - Item 1: 1 \u00d7 26 = 26\n   - Item 2: 4 \u00d7 23 = 92\n   - Item 3: 1 \u00d7 97 = 97\n   - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 79 = 158\n   - Item 5: 1 \u00d7 77 = 77\n\n   Total value for me = 26 + 92 + 97 + 158 + 77 = 450\n\n450 is significantly greater than my outside offer of 61, and an initial offer like this leaves plenty of room for negotiation while securing a strong value for myself.\n\nTherefore, my action will be to make the following counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 4, 1, 2, 1]}",

                    "response": "To determine the best course of action, let's follow the step-by-step process:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n1. **My outside offer value:** 186\n2. **Values of items:**\n   - Item 1: 95\n   - Item 2: 5\n   - Item 3: 8\n   - Item 4: 28\n   - Item 5: 32\n3. **Total pool of items:** \n   - 1 unit of item 1\n   - 8 units of item 2\n   - 2 units of item 3\n   - 4 units of item 4\n   - 2 units of item 5\n4. **Discount factor impact:** Since it's Round 1, the discount factor does not apply yet, as \\(\\gamma^{0} = 1\\).\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n- **Current offer on the table:** [0, 4, 1, 2, 1]\n  - Value to me:\n    - Item 1: 0 \u00d7 95 = 0\n    - Item 2: 4 \u00d7 5 = 20\n    - Item 3: 1 \u00d7 8 = 8\n    - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 28 = 56\n    - Item 5: 1 \u00d7 32 = 32\n  - Total value if I accept = 0 + 20 + 8 + 56 + 32 = 116\n\n**Comparison to outside offer:**\n- The value of the current offer (116) is less than the outside offer value (186). Hence, I should not accept this offer.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\nTo make a counteroffer, ensure the value is greater than my outside offer of 186.\n\n#### Proposing a Counteroffer\nLet's propose a division such that my value is maximized while it's still acceptable to Player 1. A starting point could be attempting to keep the higher value items:\n\n- Suppose I aim to keep:\n  - 0 units of item 1 (value = 95 per unit) since I have a high value here, but Player 1 doesn't offer any, suggesting they might value it too.\n  - 2 units of item 4 (value = 28 per unit) as Player 1 offered half to me, indicating they might value it similarly.\n  - The rest of items that maximize my value.\n\nFor a possible counteroffer, I'll assess:\n- **Retain:** 1 unit of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5\n- **Offer to Player 1:** 0, 5, 1, 2, 1\n\nCalculate my total value:\n- **My Allocation:**\n  - Item 1: 1 \u00d7 95 = 95\n  - Item 2: 3 \u00d7 5 = 15\n  - Item 3: 1 \u00d7 8 = 8\n  - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 28 = 56\n  - Item 5: 1 \u00d7 32 = 32\n- **Total value:** 95 + 15 + 8 + 56 + 32 = 206\n\nThis proposed distribution gives me a value of 206, which is greater than my outside offer of 186.\n\nTherefore, my action will be:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 5, 1, 2, 1]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    26 x 1 + 23 x 1 + 97 x 0 + 79 x 0 + 77 x 0\n    which is 49 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 61. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 4, 1, 2, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 5, 1, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 5, 1, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Here's the step-by-step analysis:\n\n### 1) Analyze the Current Situation:\n- **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 61.\n- **Values of the Items to Me:**\n  - Item 1 = 26\n  - Item 2 = 23\n  - Item 3 = 97\n  - Item 4 = 79\n  - Item 5 = 77\n- **Total Pool of Items:** Total items available are [1, 8, 2, 4, 2].\n- **Discount Factor:** The value of the negotiation decreases over rounds due to the discount rate (gamma = 0.98). However, since it is currently round 2, the discount factor is less impactful since the sequence is almost concluded.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n- **Current Offer (Offered to Me):** [0, 5, 1, 2, 1]\n  - My value if accepted: \n    - 0 units of Item 1 = 0\n    - 5 units of Item 2 = 5 \u00d7 23 = 115\n    - 1 unit of Item 3 = 1 \u00d7 97 = 97\n    - 2 units of Item 4 = 2 \u00d7 79 = 158\n    - 1 unit of Item 5 = 1 \u00d7 77 = 77\n  - Total Value = 0 + 115 + 97 + 158 + 77 = 447\n\nSince this division exceeds my outside offer value of 61 and is subject to the current discount factor of \\(0.98\\), the effective value now is \\(447 \\times 0.98 = 438.06\\), which is still significantly greater than 61. The current offer from Player 2 is thus very favorable to me.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision:\n- **Current Offer Evaluation:** The calculated value of the current offer (438.06) is much higher than my outside offer (61). There is no strategic advantage in negotiating further, as I am getting a considerably better deal than the fallback option.\n\n- **Choice:** Based on this evaluation, the optimal action is to accept the current offer, ensuring a substantial gain over my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 4, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    23 x 2 + 33 x 0 + 94 x 4 + 88 x 0 + 23 x 1\n    which is 445 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 446. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 0, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 2, 0, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To determine the best action, let's analyze the situation step-by-step:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is **446**.\n   - My values for each item per unit are as follows:\n     - Item 1: 23\n     - Item 2: 33\n     - Item 3: 94\n     - Item 4: 88\n     - Item 5: 23\n   - The total pool of items consists of:\n     - 4 units of item 1,\n     - 4 units of item 2,\n     - 6 units of item 3,\n     - 2 units of item 4,\n     - 1 unit of item 5.\n   - The discount factor, gamma = 0.98, affects the negotiation value in future rounds. Since this is round 1, the discount factor does not yet apply.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** I am being offered [2, 2, 0, 2, 1] which means:\n     - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 23 = 46\n     - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 33 = 66\n     - 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 94 = 0\n     - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 88 = 176\n     - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 23 = 23\n     - Total value of the current offer = 46 + 66 + 0 + 176 + 23 = **311**\n   - This current offer of 311 is less than my outside offer of 446. Accepting it would be a mistake.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n   - I should not accept the current offer because it is less valuable than my outside offer.\n   - Walking away is an option if I cannot secure a better offer.\n   - I should propose a counteroffer that is better than 446.\n\nTo develop a counteroffer, let's start by ensuring that the value of what I keep is at least better than 446 and adjust the division strategically, keeping the following considerations in mind: I highly value item 3 and item 4 due to their high per-unit values.\n\nA potential counteroffer could be offering [0, 0, 1, 0, 0] to Player 1, thus keeping:\n   - 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 23 = 92\n   - 4 units of item 2 = 4 \u00d7 33 = 132\n   - 5 units of item 3 = 5 \u00d7 94 = 470\n   - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 88 = 176\n   - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 23 = 23\n   - Total value = 92 + 132 + 470 + 176 + 23 = **893**\n\nThis counteroffer ensures my value from the negotiation well exceeds my outside offer.\n\nTherefore, my action is:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]}\n```",

Since we are in round 2, any accepted offer's value will be multiplied by \\(0.98^{1} = 0.98\\).\n\n### 2) Assess the value of offers:\n\n- **Current offer ([2, 1, 0, 2, 1]):** Calculate the value if you accept:\n  - Item 1: 2 units \u00d7 23 = 46\n  - Item 2: 1 unit \u00d7 33 = 33\n  - Item 3: 0 unit \u00d7 94 = 0\n  - Item 4: 2 units \u00d7 88 = 176\n  - Item 5: 1 unit \u00d7 23 = 23\n  - Total value = 46 + 33 + 0 + 176 + 23 = 278\n  - Adjusted for discount: 278 \u00d7 0.98 = 272.44\n\n- **Outside offer value comparison:**\n  - Your outside offer value is 446, which is greater than 272.44.\n  - Therefore, accepting the current offer would yield less value than your outside offer.\n\n- **Potential counteroffers:**\n  - We are looking for a division where your calculated total value is more than 446.\n  - Let\u2019s find such a counteroffer:\n    - Keeping at least one high-value item, especially item 3 or 4 due to their higher unit value.\n\nLet's propose keeping 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5 and calculate:\n- Item 1: 0 units \u00d7 23 = 0\n- Item 2: 0 units \u00d7 33 = 0\n- Item 3: 6 units \u00d7 94 = 564\n- Item 4: 0 units \u00d7 88 = 0\n- Item 5: 0 units \u00d7 23 = 0\n- Total value = 564\n- This is greater than your outside offer of 446, making it a valid counteroffer.\n\n### 3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n\nSince the current offer is less valuable to you than the outside offer, you should propose a counteroffer that maximizes the potential value you can get from the items. Let\u2019s go with the identified counteroffer.\n\nTherefore, the counteroffer to propose is:\n- Giving Player 1: [4, 4, 0, 2, 1]\n\nThe action is:\n```python\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 4, 0, 2, 1]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 351. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 606 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 3, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    44 x 0 + 38 x 2 + 91 x 3 + 6 x 0 + 23 x 0\n    which is 349 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 351. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 0, 2, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 0, 2, 1]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [4, 4, 0, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [4, 4, 0, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

It can happen my earlier calculations might have mistakes, to keep it a simple approach and improve, I will tweak and test-action with various small changes till desired outcome over matches.\n\nFinal revision to offer:\n- Keep 3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5\n\nRecalculation:\n- 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 86 = 258\n- 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 51 = 102\n- 4 units of item 3: 4 \u00d7 14 = 56\n- 5 units of item 4: 5 \u00d7 35 = 175\n- 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 1 = 1\n\nTotal value for me: 258 + 102 + 56 + 175 + 1 = 592, calculated a similar wrong.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 815. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 855 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 2, 3, 3, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    52 x 3 + 92 x 2 + 46 x 3 + 46 x 3 + 49 x 4\n    which is 812 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 815. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To make an informed decision, let's follow a structured analysis.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the current situation\n\n- **Outside offer value:** My outside offer value is 815.\n\n- **Values of items:**\n  - Item 1 has a value of 52 per unit.\n  - Item 2 has a value of 92 per unit.\n  - Item 3 has a value of 46 per unit.\n  - Item 4 has a value of 46 per unit.\n  - Item 5 has a value of 49 per unit.\n\n- **Total pool of items:**\n  - 9 units of item 1\n  - 4 units of item 2\n  - 4 units of item 3\n  - 3 units of item 4\n  - 5 units of item 5\n\n- **Discount factor:** The discount factor, gamma, is 0.98. This means that accepting offers early might be advantageous as the value decreases with subsequent rounds.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the value of offers\n\nSince there is no current offer, let's explore potential counteroffers. Our aim is to create an offer that gives us a value greater than or equal to 815.\n\n**Let's consider proposing various distributions:**  \n1. **Offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]:** (Give nothing to Player 2, keep all for myself)\n   - Value to me:\n     - 9 units of item 1: 9 \u00d7 52 = 468\n     - 4 units of item 2: 4 \u00d7 92 = 368\n     - 4 units of item 3: 4 \u00d7 46 = 184\n     - 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 46 = 138\n     - 5 units of item 5: 5 \u00d7 49 = 245\n   - Total value = 1403\n\nThis offer maximizes my value based on the item values and is significantly greater than my outside offer. However, offering nothing to Player 2 is likely to be declined and might negatively influence subsequent rounds.\n\n**Approach to offering:**  \nI should consider a more balanced offer to ensure the negotiation remains competitive while maximizing my payoff.\n\n**Balanced Offer Example:**  \nLet's offer something more pragmatic, like [5, 2, 2, 1, 2].\n- Total units given:\n  - 4 units of item 1 to me: 4 \u00d7 52 = 208\n  - 2 units of item 2 to me: 2 \u00d7 92 = 184\n  - 2 units of item 3 to me: 2 \u00d7 46 = 92\n  - 2 units of item 4 to me: 2 \u00d7 46 = 92\n  - 3 units of item 5 to me: 3 \u00d7 49 = 147\n- Total value = 723\n\nThis potential result is lower than my outside offer. Therefore, I should retain more value.\n\n**Adjusted Offer:** Let's aim for a division offering Player 2 something beneficial yet maintaining my required value.\n\nOffer: [5, 1, 1, 1, 2].\n- Calculation for what I keep:\n  - 4 units of item 1: 4 \u00d7 52 = 208\n  - 3 units of item 2: 3 \u00d7 92 = 276\n  - 3 units of item 3: 3 \u00d7 46 = 138\n  - 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 46 = 92\n  - 3 units of item 5: 3 \u00d7 49 = 147\n- Total value = 861\n\nThis exceeds my outside offer value of 815, making it a worthwhile consideration.\n\n### Step 3: Make a decision\n\nGiven this analysis, I will make an offer to Player 2 that maintains my value above the outside offer, while considering an initial reasonable division:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [5, 1, 1, 1, 2]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 300. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 801 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 2, 0, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    17 x 1 + 57 x 0 + 79 x 2 + 83 x 0 + 31 x 4\n    which is 299 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 300. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 4]\n\n    What is your action?

Since we are in round 2, the adjusted present value would be multiplied by \\( \\gamma^1 = 0.98 \\).\n\n### 2) Assess the value of offers:\n- **Current offer** (being offered to me, i.e., [0, 0, 0, 0, 4]):\n  - My total value if I accept it: \n    - Item 5: 4 units \u00d7 38 = 152\n  - Total value = 152\n  - Considering the discount factor, the adjusted value is \\( 152 \\times 0.98 = 148.96 \\)\n\n- **Compare with my outside offer:** \n  - The adjusted value of the current offer (148.96) is significantly less than my outside offer (431).\n\n- **Potential counteroffers:** \n  Let's ensure potential counteroffers are better than my outside offer. \n\n  For example, if I propose giving [0, 0, 1, 1, 5] (I keep [1, 0, 1, 2, 1]):\n  - My total value: \n    - Item 1: 1 \u00d7 80 = 80\n    - Item 3: 1 \u00d7 91 = 91\n    - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 66 = 132\n    - Item 5: 1 \u00d7 38 = 38\n  - Total value = 341\n  - This is still less than my outside offer of 431.\n\n  Let's adjust to a potentially better offer:\n  Let's propose [0, 0, 1, 2, 5] (I keep [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]):\n  - My total value:\n    - Item 1: 1 \u00d7 80 = 80\n    - Item 3: 1 \u00d7 91 = 91\n    - Item 4: 1 \u00d7 66 = 66\n    - Item 5: 1 \u00d7 38 = 38\n  - Total value = 275\n  - This is still less than 431.\n\n  Continue adjusting:\n\n  Final counteroffer proposal: [0, 0, 0, 1, 5] (I keep [1, 0, 2, 2, 1])\n  - My total value:\n    - Item 1: 1 \u00d7 80 = 80\n    - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 91 = 182\n    - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 66 = 132\n    - Item 5: 1 \u00d7 38 = 38\n  - Total value = 432\n  - This is slightly more than my outside offer of 431.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1329. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1008 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 6, 1, 6, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    71 x 2 + 87 x 6 + 58 x 1 + 91 x 6 + 29 x 2\n    which is 1326 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1329. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

This implies that if an agreement is delayed to future rounds, the effective value will decrease because it will be multiplied by 0.98^(r-1), where r is the round number.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n1. **Value of Current Offer:**\n   - The current offer from Player 1 is [0, 1, 0, 1, 1] (amount offered to me).\n   - Calculating my total value for this offer:\n     - Item 1: 0 units \u00d7 86 = 0\n     - Item 2: 1 unit \u00d7 48 = 48\n     - Item 3: 0 units \u00d7 1 = 0\n     - Item 4: 1 unit \u00d7 6 = 6\n     - Item 5: 1 unit \u00d7 86 = 86\n     - Total = 48 + 6 + 86 = 140\n\n2. **Comparison with Outside Offer:**\n   - Current offer value: 140\n   - Outside offer value: 130\n   \n3. **Discounted Value for Rounds:**\n   - Since this is round 1, the discount factor does not impact as much. But any rejection will affect future rounds with a discount. \n\n### Step 3: Decision Making\n\n1. **Should I Accept the Current Offer?**\n   - The current offer provides me with a value of 140, which is greater than my outside offer of 130. Therefore, accepting the current offer yields a higher value than walking away.\n\n2. **Should I Walk Away?**\n   - Walking away would result in me getting my outside offer value of 130, which is less than the value of the current offer (140).\n\n3. **Should I Make a Counteroffer?**\n   - The current offer already provides a value higher than my outside offer. Making a counteroffer could potentially lead to reduced value due to the discount factor or risk player 1 walking away if not acceptable to them.\n\nGiven this analysis, I will choose to accept the current offer, as it is better than my outside option and avoids complications of future negotiations with a discount factor.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

If I accept a deal in round 2, my effective value will be multiplied by 0.98.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n\n- **Current Offer:** None, since there is no current offer on the table.\n- **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to assess how to allocate the items to maximize my total value while ensuring it's greater than my outside offer of 1081.\n\nLet's propose a distribution to keep the highest valued items with me and share lesser valued items, checking if this yields a higher than 1081 value:\n\n#### Proposed Offer:\n- Offer items to Player 2: [1 unit of item1, 3 units of item2, 2 units of item3, 1 unit of item4, 2 units of item5]\n\n**Calculation of My Value:**\n- Keep 1 unit of item 1: \\( 1 \\times 42 = 42\\)\n- Keep 3 units of item 2: \\( 3 \\times 55 = 165\\)\n- Keep 3 units of item 3: \\( 3 \\times 90 = 270\\)\n- Keep 2 units of item 4: \\( 2 \\times 35 = 70\\)\n- Keep 3 units of item 5: \\( 3 \\times 93 = 279\\)\n\n**Total My Value = 42 + 165 + 270 + 70 + 279 = 826**\n\nThis value (826) is less than my outside offer of 1081, so I need to improve my offer to keep more high-valued items.\n\nLet's try an alternative allocation:\n\n#### Improved Proposed Counteroffer:\n- Offer items to Player 2: [0 units of item1, 5 units of item2, 2 units of item3, 1 unit of item4, 2 units of item5]\n\n**Calculation of My Value:**\n- Keep 2 units of item 1: \\( 2 \\times 42 = 84\\)\n- Keep 1 unit of item 2: \\( 1 \\times 55 = 55\\)\n- Keep 3 units of item 3: \\( 3 \\times 90 = 270\\)\n- Keep 2 units of item 4: \\( 2 \\times 35 = 70\\)\n- Keep 3 units of item 5: \\( 3 \\times 93 = 279\\)\n\n**Total My Value = 84 + 55 + 270 + 70 + 279 = 758**\n\nMy new recalculated total of 758 is still lower than my outside offer of 1081. Therefore, the new proposal won't make sense either.\n\nAttempt a new counter-offer:\n\n#### New Proposed Allocation:\n- Offer items to Player 2: [1 unit of item1, 5 units of item2, 1 units of item3, 2 unit of item4, 1 units of item5]\n\n**Calculation of My Value:**\n- Keep 1 unit of item 1: \\( 1 \\times 42 = 42\\)\n- Keep 1 unit of item 2: \\( 1 \\times 55 = 55\\)\n- Keep 4 units of item 3: \\( 4 \\times 90 = 360\\)\n- Keep 1 units of item 4: \\( 1 \\times 35 = 35\\)\n- Keep 4 units of item 5: \\( 4 \\times 93 = 372\\)\n\n**Total My Value = 42 + 55 + 360 + 35 + 372 = 864**\n\nThe recalculated total of 864 does not surpass my outside offer of 1081.\n\nNow, let's attempt one more approach focusing on a better balance:\n\n#### Final Proposed Counteroffer:\n- Offer items to Player 2: [0 units of item1, 4 units of item2, 1 units of item3, 1 unit of item4, 2 units of item5]\n\n**Calculation of My Value:**\n- Keep 2 units of item 1: \\( 2 \\times 42 = 84\\)\n- Keep 2 units of item 2: \\( 2 \\times 55 = 110\\)\n- Keep 4 units of item 3: \\( 4 \\times 90 = 360\\)\n- Keep 2 units of item 4: \\( 2 \\times 35 = 70\\)\n- Keep 3 units of item 5: \\( 3 \\times 93 = 279\\)\n\n**Total My Value = 84 + 110 + 360 + 70 + 279 = 903**\n\nThis value (903) still does not exceed my guaranteed outside offer of 1081, so I won't take additional risks.\n\n### 3) Decision:\n\nSince a beneficial distribution better than the outside offer of 1081 using the limited pool can't be achieved, successfully:\n\nI am opting for:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 528. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 528. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 672 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 3, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    28 x 0 + 79 x 3 + 56 x 3 + 34 x 2 + 27 x 2\n    which is 527 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 528. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

This means the value of future offers decreases slightly if we wait for another round.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n\n- **Current Offer:** \n  - I am offered [0, 3, 1, 1, 3] items.\n  - My value for this offer: \n    - Item 1: 0 units \u00d7 47 = 0\n    - Item 2: 3 units \u00d7 74 = 222\n    - Item 3: 1 unit \u00d7 61 = 61\n    - Item 4: 1 unit \u00d7 15 = 15\n    - Item 5: 3 units \u00d7 86 = 258\n  - Total value = 556\n\n- **Comparison with Outside Offer:** \n  - My outside offer is 802.\n  - The current offer provides me a value of 556, which is less than my outside offer.\n  \nSince the current offer (556) is less than my outside offer (802), I should either propose a counteroffer or plan to walk away if no satisfactory offer can be reached.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision:\n\n- **Accept the Current Offer:** No, since the value (556) is less than my outside offer (802).\n- **Walk Away:** It's an option, but first, I will attempt a counteroffer since this is only the first round.\n- **Propose a Counteroffer:** I need to propose a distribution that results in a value greater than 802 for me.\n\nLet\u2019s construct a counteroffer that maximizes my gain:\n\nIf I keep more units of items with higher values to me, especially items 2 and 5:\n\n- Keeping [1, 2, 2, 1, 4] would mean offering Player 1 [0, 5, 1, 1, 1]:\n  - Value for me if I keep [1, 2, 2, 1, 4]:\n    - Item 1: 1 unit \u00d7 47 = 47\n    - Item 2: 2 units \u00d7 74 = 148\n    - Item 3: 2 units \u00d7 61 = 122\n    - Item 4: 1 unit \u00d7 15 = 15\n    - Item 5: 4 units \u00d7 86 = 344\n  - Total value = 676\n\nThis counteroffer still doesn't exceed my outside offer (802), so let's try another distribution:\n\nLet's attempt [1, 4, 2, 1, 3], offering Player 1 [0, 3, 1, 1, 2]:\n\n- Value for me if I keep [1, 4, 2, 1, 3]:\n  - Item 1: 1 unit \u00d7 47 = 47\n  - Item 2: 4 units \u00d7 74 = 296\n  - Item 3: 2 units \u00d7 61 = 122\n  - Item 4: 1 unit \u00d7 15 = 15\n  - Item 5: 3 units \u00d7 86 = 258\n- Total value = 738\n\nStill not greater than 802. Therefore, let's adjust further:\n\nTry keeping [1, 5, 2, 1, 2], offering Player 1 [0, 2, 1, 1, 3]:\n\n- Value for me if I keep [1, 5, 2, 1, 2]:\n  - Item 1: 1 unit \u00d7 47 = 47\n  - Item 2: 5 units \u00d7 74 = 370\n  - Item 3: 2 units \u00d7 61 = 122\n  - Item 4: 1 unit \u00d7 15 = 15\n  - Item 5: 2 units \u00d7 86 = 172\n- Total value = 726\n\nKeep adjusting until an optimal offer is found that exceeds my outside offer. Since detailed recalculations are necessary to optimize precisely, I might settle on the strategy to walk if no feasible counteroffer provides more value than 802 in the first round. However, let's construct a very generous offer to ensure a value over 802:\n\nOffer Player 1 [0, 2, 0, 0, 5], keeping [1, 5, 3, 2, 0]:\n\n- Value for me if I keep [1, 5, 3, 2, 0]:\n  - Item 1: 1 unit \u00d7 47 = 47\n  - Item 2: 5 units \u00d7 74 = 370\n  - Item 3: 3 units \u00d7 61 = 183\n  - Item 4: 2 units \u00d7 15 = 30\n  - Item 5: 0 units \u00d7 86 = 0\n- Total value = 630 \\(\\times 0.98\\) (to adjust for discount factor due to counteroffer)\n\nGiven the complexity in finding an optimal valid offer combination (under constraint of still keeping total value greater than 802), returning to an initial preliminary option as counteroffer is essential to rule modifications allowed. \n\nHence, I will walk due to risk of errors and adherence to outcome guarantees. \n\nFinal action:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 90. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 90. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 945 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    48 x 0 + 50 x 0 + 83 x 1 + 73 x 0 + 61 x 0\n    which is 83 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 90. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

This means if I walk away from the negotiation, I gain a value of 90.\n\n- **Values of the Items Involved**:\n  - Item 1: 3 units, Value per unit = 48\n  - Item 2: 4 units, Value per unit = 50\n  - Item 3: 6 units, Value per unit = 83\n  - Item 4: 7 units, Value per unit = 73\n  - Item 5: 3 units, Value per unit = 61 \n\n- **Total Pool of Items**:\n  - Item 1: 3 units\n  - Item 2: 4 units\n  - Item 3: 6 units\n  - Item 4: 7 units\n  - Item 5: 3 units\n\n- **Discount Factor**: The discount factor, gamma = 0.98, reduces the value of outcomes based on the number of negotiation rounds. Outcomes in later rounds have slightly less value in present terms, so I'd prefer to conclude the negotiation earlier rather than later if offers are equal.\n\n### 2) Assess the value of offers:\n\n- **Current Offer**: There is no current offer on the table, so nothing to assess here.\n\n- **Potential Counteroffers**: Since there is no current offer, consider what I should propose. My goal is to create an offer that would provide me with more value than my outside offer of 90.\n\nLet's evaluate a couple of possible divisions of items that give me a value more than 90:\n\n#### Example Counteroffer 1:\nKeep for myself:\n- Item 1: 0 units\n- Item 2: 0 units\n- Item 3: 5 units\n- Item 4: 4 units\n- Item 5: 2 units\n\nCounteroffer to Player 2: [3, 4, 1, 3, 1]\n\nValue to me:\n- Item 1: 0 \u00d7 48 = 0\n- Item 2: 0 \u00d7 50 = 0\n- Item 3: 5 \u00d7 83 = 415\n- Item 4: 4 \u00d7 73 = 292\n- Item 5: 2 \u00d7 61 = 122\n\nTotal value = 0 + 0 + 415 + 292 + 122 = 829\n\nThis value is clearly above my outside offer of 90 and is a strong starting point for negotiation.\n\n### 3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n\nBased on the above, we need to weigh options that ensure we get a better outcome than the outside offer. Given no current offer and our calculations showing advantage in proposing a reasonable counteroffer, it should be:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 4, 1, 3, 1]}\n```\n\nThis is a valid and strategic counteroffer maximizing the value I would receive above my outside offer and potential reasonable acceptance.",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 2, 0, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 4, 7, 3, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    24 x 0 + 42 x 4 + 85 x 7 + 6 x 3 + 100 x 0\n    which is 781 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 782. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 3, 1, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    39 x 0 + 23 x 2 + 2 x 3 + 8 x 1 + 89 x 2\n    which is 238 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 239. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 2, 2, 3, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    36 x 1 + 53 x 2 + 14 x 2 + 71 x 3 + 24 x 3\n    which is 455 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 456. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 1, 1, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 1, 1, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To make a decision, let's go through the steps outlined:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - **Outside offer value:** My outside offer value is 456.\n   - **Values of the items:** My values are: item 1 = 36, item 2 = 53, item 3 = 14, item 4 = 71, item 5 = 24.\n   - **Total pool of items:** 3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5.\n   - **Discount factor:** In this first round, the discount factor does not reduce the present value of an accepted offer.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer on the table ([0, 1, 1, 1, 3]):**\n     - My value:\n       - 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 36 = 0\n       - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 53 = 53\n       - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 14 = 14\n       - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 71 = 71\n       - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72\n     - Total value = 210\n   \n   - **Compare to outside offer value:** My outside offer is 456, which is significantly higher than 210.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n   - The current offer is worse than my outside offer (210 < 456).\n   - I will look to propose a counteroffer that gives me a value equal to or better than my outside offer.\n\nI need to devise a counteroffer where my retained items have a value greater than my outside offer. Let's try a division that might give me more value:\n\nPropose to keep:\n   - Items: 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5.\n\nCalculating the value:\n   - 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 36 = 72\n   - 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 53 = 53\n   - 3 units of item 3: 3 \u00d7 14 = 42\n   - 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 71 = 142\n   - 1 units of item 5: 1 \u00d7 24 = 24\n   - Total value = 333\n\nWhile this value is still less than my outside offer value, I must propose a counteroffer that maximizes my value while considering that a perfect offer may still not reach outside value but should strive to be close. To further iterate:\n\nOffer Player 1:\n   - Items: 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 3 units of item 5. This gives me:\n   - Items I keep: 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5.\n\nNow calculating:\n   - 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 36 = 72\n   - 1 units of item 2: 1 \u00d7 53 = 53\n   - 3 units of item 3: 3 \u00d7 14 = 42\n   - 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 71 = 142\n   - 1 units of item 5: 1 \u00d7 24 = 24\n   - Total value = 333\n   \nSince I cannot reach a satisfactory offer that is greater than my outside offer, a strategic counteroffer is necessary. Adjust one more attempt:\n\nFinal proposed retention to maximize potential for acceptance:\n   - Offer Player 1: [1, 1, 0, 1, 3]\n\nThis still leaves my value at:\n   - 72 (2 units of item 1)\n   - 53 (1 unit of item 2)\n   - 42 (3 units of item 3)\n   - 142 (2 units of item 4)\n   - 24 (1 unit of item 5)\n    - Total value = 333   \n\nDecision:\nTo iterate towards potentially better positioning while accepting that this is a beginning round, counteroffer using a balanced view:\n   \n   {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 1, 3]}",

Let's explore a division scenario where I keep more valuable items to maximize my payoff.\n  \n  Let's calculate potential offer value:\n  - **Offer Strategy:** Offer less valuable units and retain more valuable ones up to maximizing my value greater than 608.\n  \n  Consider the following allocation where I offer to Player 2 [0, 1, 0, 3, 3] (i.e., I keep [7, 3, 2, 3, 3] units):\n\n1. **My Value:**\n   - Item 1: 7 \u00d7 29 = 203\n   - Item 2: 3 \u00d7 77 = 231\n   - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 87 = 174\n   - Item 4: 3 \u00d7 36 = 108\n   - Item 5: 3 \u00d7 76 = 228\n\n   Total value to me = 203 + 231 + 174 + 108 + 228 = 944\n\n- **Comparison to Outside Offer:**  \n  The total value of this offer (944) is greater than my outside offer (608), making it a beneficial offer for me.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\nBased on my analysis, the most strategic move is to make an offer for Player 2 that maximizes my value above my outside offer, preventing mistakes such as making an inferior offer or walking away from a potentially better offer.\n\n**Action Decision:** Offer Player 2 the proposed division to maximize my net gain.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 3, 3]}\n```",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 1305. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1305. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 840 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [7, 3, 2, 6, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    87 x 7 + 45 x 3 + 85 x 2 + 5 x 6 + 58 x 6\n    which is 1292 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1305. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "To decide the optimal action, let's analyze the current situation and evaluate potential choices step by step:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation**:\n   - **My outside offer value**: 1305.\n   - **Value of the items for me**:\n     - Item 1: 87\n     - Item 2: 45\n     - Item 3: 85\n     - Item 4: 5\n     - Item 5: 58\n   - **Total pool of items**: 7 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5.\n   - **Discount factor influence**: A discount rate of gamma = 0.98 means delaying acceptance reduces the present value of any accepted offer. The longer you wait, the lower the value unless the offer improves.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers**:\n   - **Current offer from Player 1 [0, 1, 0, 3, 3]**:\n     - My allocation would be [7, 3, 2, 3, 3].\n     - Value calculation if I accept:\n       - 7 units of item 1 = 7 \u00d7 87 = 609\n       - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135\n       - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 85 = 170\n       - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15\n       - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174\n       - Total value = 1103\n\n   This is less than my outside offer value of 1305.

Therefore, I shouldn't accept it.\n   - Walking away now would give me my outside offer value of 1305, which is better than accepting the current offer.\n   - To make a counteroffer, I should aim for a division that gives me more than my outside offer value of 1305.\n\n   To form a counteroffer, let's split the items such that I, ideally, retain:\n   - High-value items: Maximize the amounts of item 1 and item 3 (highest unit values for me).\n   - Allocate fewer units of items that I value less (especially item 4).\n\n   A potential counteroffer could be to keep:\n   - 6 units of item 1 (offering 1 to Player 1)\n   - 3 units of item 2 (offering 1 to Player 1)\n   - 2 units of item 3 (offering 0 to Player 1)\n   - 0 units of item 4 (offering all 6 to Player 1)\n   - 1 unit of item 5 (offering 5 to Player 1)\n   \n   This allocation to me would yield:\n   - 6 units of item 1 = 6 \u00d7 87 = 522\n   - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135\n   - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 85 = 170\n   - 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 5 = 0\n   - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 58 = 58\n   - Total value = 885\n   - Sum of given units to Player 1:\n       - 1 unit of item 1\n       - 1 unit of item 2 \n       - 0 units of item 3 \n       - 6 units of item 4 \n       - 5 units of Item 5\n   \n   Which means I would not significantly decrease my current value, since indeed in a first round most probable is to reject my offer automatically.\n\nWhile the above calculations attempt a better allocation to maximize my value compared to the current offer, an accurate and precise counteroffer would be needed.
