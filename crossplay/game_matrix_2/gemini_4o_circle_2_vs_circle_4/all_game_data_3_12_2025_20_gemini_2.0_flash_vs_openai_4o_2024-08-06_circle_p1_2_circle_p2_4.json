My outside offer is 95. I need to make an offer to player 2.\n\nTo determine a good initial offer, I need to estimate the value of each item to Player 2. I don't know their values, but I know they are drawn from a uniform distribution between 1 and 101. A reasonable starting point is to offer Player 2 an amount that is slightly more than half the total value of the items, assuming they have values around the middle of the range (around 50). I have:\n* 4 units of item 1\n* 2 units of item 2\n* 6 units of item 3\n* 4 units of item 4\n* 8 units of item 5\n\nLet's offer Player 2 half of the items, rounded down. That would be:\n* 2 units of item 1\n* 1 unit of item 2\n* 3 units of item 3\n* 2 units of item 4\n* 4 units of item 5\n\nNow I need to calculate the value to me if I offer this to Player 2. It means I keep:\n* 2 units of item 1\n* 1 unit of item 2\n* 3 units of item 3\n* 2 units of item 4\n* 4 units of item 5\n\nMy value for these items is:\n* 2 * 62 = 124\n* 1 * 56 = 56\n* 3 * 48 = 144\n* 2 * 45 = 90\n* 4 * 58 = 232\nTotal value = 124 + 56 + 144 + 90 + 232 = 646\n\nSince 646 is much greater than my outside offer of 95, I should definitely make an offer.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

It means that if the negotiation goes to another round, the value of an offer must be multiplied by 0.98 to get its present value.\n\n### 2) Assess the value of offers:\n\n- **Current offer (2, 1, 3, 2, 4):** \n  - Value of 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 86 = 172\n  - Value of 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 37 = 37\n  - Value of 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 28 = 84\n  - Value of 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 33 = 66\n  - Value of 4 units of item 5 = 4 \u00d7 8 = 32\n  - Total value if I accept the current offer = 172 + 37 + 84 + 66 + 32 = 391\n\nSince 391 is less than my outside offer of 656, accepting this offer is not advantageous.\n\n- **Potential counteroffers:** \n  - I need to propose a division that gives me a total value greater than my outside offer of 656 to be beneficial.\n  \n  Example counteroffer:\n  - Offer Player 1: [1, 0, 2, 1, 2]\n  - Keeping for myself: [3, 2, 4, 3, 6]\n\n  This would give me the following values:\n  - Value of 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258\n  - Value of 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 37 = 74\n  - Value of 4 units of item 3 = 4 \u00d7 28 = 112\n  - Value of 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99\n  - Value of 6 units of item 5 = 6 \u00d7 8 = 48\n  - Total value = 258 + 74 + 112 + 99 + 48 = 591\n\nEven though this potential counteroffer gives me a value less than my outside offer (591 < 656), making it a mistake (Mistake 2), if the counteroffers from Player 1 potentially increase, it could be worth taking a strategic counteroffer to encourage future rounds.\n\n### 3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n\n- **Should I accept the current offer?** No, because 391 is less than my outside offer of 656.\n- **Should I walk away?** Not yet, since there could be a possibility in the next round to get a better deal.\n- **Should I propose a specific counteroffer?** Yes, I'll propose a counteroffer to try and improve the future offers.\n\nThus, I will propose the counteroffer:\n- **{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 2, 1, 2]}**",

I am Player 1.\n\nMy values are:\nItem 1: 88 (3 units)\nItem 2: 10 (2 units)\nItem 3: 63 (7 units)\nItem 4: 46 (3 units)\nItem 5: 64 (4 units)\nMy outside offer: 198\n\nI want to maximize my expected value, considering the discount factor of 0.98 per round.\nSince it's the first round and there's no offer on the table, I need to make an initial offer to Player 2. A good starting point is to consider splitting the items roughly in half, adjusting for my own valuation. I want to keep the items I value highly and offer more of the items I value less.\n\nLet's try to calculate a fair split. I want to determine how many of each item I should offer to player 2, leaving the rest for myself.\n\nMy total value is 3*88 + 2*10 + 7*63 + 3*46 + 4*64 = 264 + 20 + 441 + 138 + 256 = 1119.\n\nI should aim for an offer that gives me at least 198 * 0.98^2 = 190.39 after 2 rejections. And at least 198 * 0.98 = 194.04 if they reject my first offer. This guides what kind of splitting of items I should do.\nOffering player 2 half of everything and see where that takes me might not be the best strategy.\n\nLet's start with a simple offer:\nItem 1: I keep 2, offer 1. Value: 2 * 88 = 176\nItem 2: I keep 1, offer 1. Value: 1 * 10 = 10\nItem 3: I keep 4, offer 3. Value: 4 * 63 = 252\nItem 4: I keep 2, offer 1. Value: 2 * 46 = 92\nItem 5: I keep 2, offer 2. Value: 2 * 64 = 128\n\nTotal value to me: 176 + 10 + 252 + 92 + 128 = 658\n\nLet's try offering more of the less valuable items to player 2.\nItem 1: Offer 1\nItem 2: Offer 1\nItem 3: Offer 3\nItem 4: Offer 1\nItem 5: Offer 2\n\nI think for the first round it's best to make a reasonable offer so the other player doesn't walk.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 3, 1, 2]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 892. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 645 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "To determine my action, let's carefully analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **My outside offer value**: 1175\n\n- **Values of the items for me**:\n  - Item 1: 35\n  - Item 2: 65\n  - Item 3: 68\n  - Item 4: 78\n  - Item 5: 29\n\n- **Total pool of items**:\n  - 5 units of item 1\n  - 4 units of item 2\n  - 4 units of item 3\n  - 5 units of item 4\n  - 4 units of item 5\n\n- **Discount factor**: The value of the negotiation outcome is affected by the discount factor gamma = 0.98 for each round after the first one. However, in this round 1, the discount factor does not apply yet.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current offer** (the amount of each item being offered to me by Player 1): [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]\n  - Value calculation:\n    - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 35 = 70\n    - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 65 = 130\n    - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 68 = 136\n    - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 78 = 156\n    - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 29 = 58\n  - Total value from the current offer = 70 + 130 + 136 + 156 + 58 = 550\n\n- **Comparison to my outside offer value**:\n  - Current offer value (550) is less than my outside offer value (1175).\n\n### Step 3: Decision\n\nSince the current offer (valued at 550) is significantly less than my outside offer (valued at 1175), accepting the current offer would be a mistake (Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for me than my outside offer).\n\nTherefore, I should not accept the current offer. Additionally, walking away at the first round is not optimal as I can still negotiate for a better deal. A counteroffer can be made to try and reach a more favorable division.\n\n### Counteroffer Evaluation:\n\nI need to ensure my counteroffer offers a value greater than my outside offer to avoid Mistake 2. A balanced approach where I aim to secure high-value items for myself might be beneficial.\n\nGiven my high-value perception for items 2, 3, and 4, I can attempt to structure a counteroffer that allows me more units of these items while still keeping some units of other items.\n\nLet's propose the following counteroffer, ensuring it retains more value for me and still gives a reasonable amount to Player 1:\n\n### Proposed Counteroffer:\n\nOffer [1, 1, 0, 1, 2] to Player 1, keeping:\n\n- 4 units of item 1: 4 \u00d7 35 = 140\n- 3 units of item 2: 3 \u00d7 65 = 195\n- 4 units of item 3: 4 \u00d7 68 = 272\n- 4 units of item 4: 4 \u00d7 78 = 312\n- 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 29 = 58\n\nMy total value for this counteroffer = 140 + 195 + 272 + 312 + 58 = 977\n\nThe proposed counteroffer still does not exceed my outside offer value of 1175, so any counteroffer lower than this will likely be a walk. However, since this is a negotiation, I attempt to give Player 1 an option that slightly improves upon their current offer to me.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nGiven the conditions, I will attempt the counteroffer to see if I can improve my standing without immediately walking.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 1, 2]}\n```",

Let's try offering [1.5, 1.5, 1, 1.5, 2.5]. However, we can only offer whole numbers. So, instead let's calculate the value of offering [2, 2, 1, 2, 3]:\n\n*   Item 1: 5 - 2 = 3 units\n*   Item 2: 4 - 2 = 2 units\n*   Item 3: 4 - 1 = 3 units\n*   Item 4: 5 - 2 = 3 units\n*   Item 5: 4 - 3 = 1 unit\n\nMy value for this counteroffer is:\n\n*   3 * 94 (item 1) = 282\n*   2 * 73 (item 2) = 146\n*   3 * 83 (item 3) = 249\n*   3 * 91 (item 4) = 273\n*   1 * 82 (item 5) = 82\n*   Total value = 282 + 146 + 249 + 273 + 82 = 1032\n\nNow, we need to apply the discount factor since it's round 2. The discount factor is 0.98^(2-1) = 0.98.\n\nSo, the present value of this counteroffer outcome is 1032 * 0.98 = 1011.36\n\nThis is significantly lower than the 1425.9 that I would get from accepting.\n\nTherefore, the best course of action is to accept the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

My goal is to maximize my discounted value, taking into account my outside offer of 1140 and the discount factor of 0.98.\n\nMy private values are:\nItem 1: 65 (5 units available)\nItem 2: 29 (2 units available)\nItem 3: 66 (1 unit available)\nItem 4: 35 (11 units available)\nItem 5: 91 (4 units available)\n\nFirst, I need to consider what a reasonable offer might look like to Player 2. Since I don't know Player 2's values, I will aim for an offer that gives them a significant portion of the items, but still leaves me with enough to exceed my outside offer when discounted.\n\nLet's start with an offer that gives Player 2 about half of the total potential value. A simple approach is to give Player 2 half of the items where possible, rounding down. This gives Player 2:\nItem 1: 2 units\nItem 2: 1 unit\nItem 3: 0 unit\nItem 4: 5 units\nItem 5: 2 unit\n\nThis leaves me with:\nItem 1: 3 units\nItem 2: 1 unit\nItem 3: 1 unit\nItem 4: 6 units\nItem 5: 2 unit\n\nMy value for this division would be:\nItem 1: 3 * 65 = 195\nItem 2: 1 * 29 = 29\nItem 3: 1 * 66 = 66\nItem 4: 6 * 35 = 210\nItem 5: 2 * 91 = 182\nTotal value = 195 + 29 + 66 + 210 + 182 = 682\n\nDiscounted value = 682 * (0.98)^(1-1) = 682\n\nThis is significantly lower than my outside offer of 1140.\n\nLet's try a different approach. I will try to make an offer that gives a larger portion of the less valuable items to Player 2, and keep most of the valuable items for myself.\n\nOffer:\nItem 1: 1 units\nItem 2: 0 units\nItem 3: 0 units\nItem 4: 6 units\nItem 5: 1 units\n\nThis leaves me with:\nItem 1: 4 units\nItem 2: 2 units\nItem 3: 1 units\nItem 4: 5 units\nItem 5: 3 units\n\nMy value for this division would be:\nItem 1: 4 * 65 = 260\nItem 2: 2 * 29 = 58\nItem 3: 1 * 66 = 66\nItem 4: 5 * 35 = 175\nItem 5: 3 * 91 = 273\nTotal value = 260 + 58 + 66 + 175 + 273 = 832\n\nDiscounted value = 832 * (0.98)^(1-1) = 832\n\nThis is still lower than my outside offer of 1140. I need to aim for a deal that gets me closer to my full potential value.\n\nI'll make an aggressive offer, giving Player 2 very little:\n\nOffer:\nItem 1: 0\nItem 2: 0\nItem 3: 0\nItem 4: 1\nItem 5: 0\n\nThis leaves me with:\nItem 1: 5\nItem 2: 2\nItem 3: 1\nItem 4: 10\nItem 5: 4\n\nMy value:\nItem 1: 5 * 65 = 325\nItem 2: 2 * 29 = 58\nItem 3: 1 * 66 = 66\nItem 4: 10 * 35 = 350\nItem 5: 4 * 91 = 364\nTotal Value: 325 + 58 + 66 + 350 + 364 = 1163\n\nDiscounted Value = 1163\n\nThis is more than my outside offer!

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

Therefore I have to offer player 2 more value.\n\nLet's try the following offer to Player 2: [1, 0, 0, 5, 0] which leaves me with [4, 2, 1, 6, 4].\n\nMy Value = (4 * 65) + (2 * 29) + (1 * 66) + (6 * 35) + (4 * 91) = 260 + 58 + 66 + 210 + 364 = 958\nPlayer 2 receives [1, 0, 0, 5, 0]. 958 * 0.98 = 938.84, still less than my walk away.\n\nLet's try the following offer to Player 2: [0, 0, 0, 4, 0] which leaves me with [5, 2, 1, 7, 4].\nMy Value = (5*65) + (2*29) + (1*66) + (7*35) + (4*91) = 325 + 58 + 66 + 245 + 364 = 1058\nPlayer 2 Receives [0, 0, 0, 4, 0]. 1058 * 0.98 = 1036.84, still less than my walk away.\n\nLet's try the following offer to Player 2: [0, 0, 0, 3, 0] which leaves me with [5, 2, 1, 8, 4].\nMy Value = (5*65) + (2*29) + (1*66) + (8*35) + (4*91) = 325 + 58 + 66 + 280 + 364 = 1093\nPlayer 2 Receives [0, 0, 0, 3, 0]. 1093 * 0.98 = 1071.14, still less than my walk away.\n\nLet's try the following offer to Player 2: [0, 0, 0, 2, 0] which leaves me with [5, 2, 1, 9, 4].\nMy Value = (5*65) + (2*29) + (1*66) + (9*35) + (4*91) = 325 + 58 + 66 + 315 + 364 = 1128\nPlayer 2 Receives [0, 0, 0, 2, 0]. 1128 * 0.98 = 1105.44, still less than my walk away.\n\nLet's try the following offer to Player 2: [0, 0, 0, 1, 0] which leaves me with [5, 2, 1, 10, 4].\nMy Value = (5*65) + (2*29) + (1*66) + (10*35) + (4*91) = 325 + 58 + 66 + 350 + 364 = 1163\nPlayer 2 Receives [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]. 1163 * 0.98 = 1140.  1140 * 0.98 = 1139.74, less than my walkaway.\n\nLet's try the following offer to Player 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] which leaves me with [5, 2, 1, 11, 4].\nMy Value = (5*65) + (2*29) + (1*66) + (11*35) + (4*91) = 325 + 58 + 66 + 385 + 364 = 1198\nPlayer 2 Receives [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. 1198 * 0.98 = 1174.04, greater than my walkaway.\nSo a counteroffer of all items is better than walking away for me.\nHowever, since player 2 is offering [0, 1, 0, 1, 0], giving the agent zero is not likely to get them to accept. I will just walk.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Since I don't know Player 2's values, I'll start by making an offer that gives them a substantial portion of the items, but still leaves me with a value greater than my outside offer.\n\nI will start with a generous offer, hoping to secure a deal quickly.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 869. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player2, 2 units of each item (keeping 1 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 900 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's start by analyzing the situation. I'm Player 1, and I want to maximize my outcome. I have an outside offer of 869. The other player, Player 2, hasn't made any offer yet, so I need to make the first offer.\n\nMy values for the items are:\n- Item 1: 20 (4 units available)\n- Item 2: 95 (4 units available)\n- Item 3: 27 (5 units available)\n- Item 4: 74 (5 units available)\n- Item 5: 84 (2 units available)\n\nMy total possible value is (4 * 20) + (4 * 95) + (5 * 27) + (5 * 74) + (2 * 84) = 80 + 380 + 135 + 370 + 168 = 1133.\n\nI want to make an offer that is likely to be accepted, but also gives me a good value. Since it's the first round, I can afford to be a bit more aggressive.  I'll aim for a split where I get significantly more than half of the total possible value. I'll start by offering Player 2 an amount that gives me a value close to my outside offer. To do this effectively, I need to predict what a rational player 2 might value these items. Since I don't know their values, the best thing I can do is assume they have similar preferences in terms of relative ranking. This means that Player 2 will also prefer Item 2, Item 5, and Item 4 over Item 1 and Item 3.\n\nI will try to construct an offer where I get to keep the majority of the high-value items (2, 4 and 5) for myself.\nLet's try offering player 2:\nItem 1: 3 units\nItem 2: 1 units\nItem 3: 3 units\nItem 4: 1 units\nItem 5: 0 units\n\nThat leaves me with\nItem 1: 1 unit, value 20\nItem 2: 3 units, value 285\nItem 3: 2 units, value 54\nItem 4: 4 units, value 296\nItem 5: 2 units, value 168\nTotal value: 20 + 285 + 54 + 296 + 168 = 823\n\nThis is below my outside offer, so I need to offer less. Let's adjust the offer to:\nItem 1: 4 units\nItem 2: 1 units\nItem 3: 3 units\nItem 4: 1 units\nItem 5: 0 units\n\nThat leaves me with\nItem 1: 0 unit, value 0\nItem 2: 3 units, value 285\nItem 3: 2 units, value 54\nItem 4: 4 units, value 296\nItem 5: 2 units, value 168\nTotal value: 0 + 285 + 54 + 296 + 168 = 803\n\nThis is also below my outside offer. Let's adjust the offer to:\nItem 1: 4 units\nItem 2: 0 units\nItem 3: 3 units\nItem 4: 1 units\nItem 5: 0 units\n\nThat leaves me with\nItem 1: 0 unit, value 0\nItem 2: 4 units, value 380\nItem 3: 2 units, value 54\nItem 4: 4 units, value 296\nItem 5: 2 units, value 168\nTotal value: 0 + 380 + 54 + 296 + 168 = 898\n\nThis is above my outside offer. Therefore, I should offer this split.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 0, 3, 1, 0]}\n```",

Specifically, the value is multiplied by 0.98^(r-1), where r is the current round number.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - For the current offer [2, 1, 2, 1, 0], my total value if I accept it is:\n     - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 30 = 60\n     - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 9 = 9\n     - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 62 = 124\n     - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 3 = 3\n     - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 23 = 0\n     - Total value = 60 + 9 + 124 + 3 + 0 = 196\n   - Since it's round 1, there is no discount factor applied, so the effective value is 196 (since gamma^(r-1) = 0.98^(1-1) = 1).\n   - My total value for the current offer (196) is much lower than my outside offer value (393).\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - I should not accept the current offer since its value (196) is much lower than my outside offer (393).\n   - Walking away would guarantee me 393, but it might be worthwhile to explore a counteroffer that could increase my value closer to my outside offer.\n   - I should propose a counteroffer that maximizes my value without making offer worse than my outside offer.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I attempt to make my value equal to or exceed my outside offer. A reasonable strategy is to claim about half (or more) of the higher value items (items 3 and 5) and still leave player 1 with a plausible share. I can offer:\n\n- [2, 1, 1, 2, 0] to Player 1.\n\nThis gives me:\n- 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 30 = 60\n- 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 9 = 18\n- 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186\n- 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 3 = 3\n- 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 23 = 23\n- Total value = 60 + 18 + 186 + 3 + 23 = 290\n\nThis value (290) is still below my outside offer, so I'll need a stronger counteroffer. Let me try again with another calculation:\n\nLet's offer [1, 1, 0, 2, 0] to Player 1:\n\nThis gives me:\n- 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 30 = 90\n- 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 9 = 18\n- 4 units of item 3 = 4 \u00d7 62 = 248\n- 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 3 = 3\n- 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 23 = 23\n- Total value = 90 + 18 + 248 + 3 + 23 = 382\n\nIn this, the total value is still below the outside offer. Instead, I should walk away.\n\nSince my outside offer is already generous, my action will be to walk away rather than lose value:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

A good strategy might be to make an offer that gives Player 2 approximately half the value. I will aim to equalize the perceived value (using my values).\nTotal Items: 5 + 6 + 2 + 9 + 3 = 25\nHalf Total Value using my values: 1714 / 2 = 857\n\nNow, I want to create an offer where Player 2 gets roughly 857 based on my valuation. I will use a heuristic of offering half of each item, rounding where necessary.\n\n* Item 1: 5 / 2 = 2.5 -> Offer 2 or 3. Let's offer 2.  Player 2 gets 2 * 88 = 176, I get 3 * 88 = 264\n* Item 2: 6 / 2 = 3 -> Offer 3. Player 2 gets 3 * 29 = 87, I get 3 * 29 = 87\n* Item 3: 2 / 2 = 1 -> Offer 1. Player 2 gets 1 * 58 = 58, I get 1 * 58 = 58\n* Item 4: 9 / 2 = 4.5 -> Offer 4 or 5. Let's offer 4. Player 2 gets 4 * 82 = 328, I get 5 * 82 = 410\n* Item 5: 3 / 2 = 1.5 -> Offer 1 or 2. Let's offer 1.

I will give one more unit of item 4 to Player 2.\nNew offer: [2, 3, 1, 5, 1]\nPlayer 2 Value: 176 + 87 + 58 + 410 + 82 = 813\nMy Value: 264 + 87 + 58 + 328 + 164 = 901\n\nThis seems like a reasonable first offer.

I'll aim to get at least my outside offer value of 229.\n\nHere's the item distribution:\n- Item 1: 5 units\n- Item 2: 4 units\n- Item 3: 3 units\n- Item 4: 3 units\n- Item 5: 1 unit\n\nI'll offer Player 2 a little more than half of the items to increase the chance of them accepting, especially since I don't know their values. My values are:\n- Item 1: 21\n- Item 2: 89\n- Item 3: 65\n- Item 4: 70\n- Item 5: 97\n\nHere's my proposed offer to Player 2:\n- Item 1: 3 units\n- Item 2: 2 units\n- Item 3: 2 units\n- Item 4: 2 units\n- Item 5: 1 unit\n\nThis means I keep:\n- Item 1: 2 units\n- Item 2: 2 units\n- Item 3: 1 units\n- Item 4: 1 units\n- Item 5: 0 units\n\nMy value for what I keep is:\n(2 * 21) + (2 * 89) + (1 * 65) + (1 * 70) + (0 * 97) = 42 + 178 + 65 + 70 + 0 = 355\n\nSince 355 > 229, this offer is better than walking away and claiming my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 2, 2, 2, 1]}\n```",

This means that for each round the total value I receive from the negotiation is multiplied by gamma to the power of (r-1), where r is the round number. Because this is the first round, there is no discount applied yet, but it will affect the next rounds.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - **Current Offer**:  \n     - I receive 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 23 = 69\n     - I receive 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 92 = 184\n     - I receive 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 7 = 14\n     - I receive 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 6 = 12\n     - I receive 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 49 = 49  \n     Total value of the current offer = 69 + 184 + 14 + 12 + 49 = 328\n   - **Comparison to Outside Offer**: 328 (value of current offer) is greater than 251 (my outside offer value). Therefore, accepting the current offer is more favorable than walking away.\n\n3) Make a decision:\n   - **Should I accept the current offer?** Yes, the current offer provides a total value of 328, which is better than my outside offer of 251.\n   - **Should I walk away?** No, because my outside offer is less valuable than the current offer.\n   - **Should I propose a counteroffer?** It is unnecessary in this situation because the current offer is favorable, and any counteroffer that tries to push further may risk the negotiation especially with the discount factor impacting future rounds.\n\nGiven this analysis, the best action in this scenario is to accept the current offer since it provides a higher value than my outside offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

In this round, the discount factor is 1 (since it's the first round), but the value decreases slightly in subsequent rounds.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer from Player 1**: [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]\n  - Value = (0 * 41) + (0 * 78) + (1 * 70) + (1 * 36) + (0 * 55)\n  - Total Value = 70 + 36 = 106\n\n- **Comparison to Outside Offer**: This current offer of 106 is significantly lower than my outside offer of 455.\n\n- **Potential Counteroffers**: I need to consider a counteroffer that will give me a value greater than or equal to my outside offer:\n\n  - Let's first try to keep as close to a balanced division and evaluate it:\n\n    - Hypothetical Division: Keeping \n      - 3 of item 1: 3 * 41 = 123\n      - 1 of item 2: 1 * 78 = 78\n      - 5 of item 3: 5 * 70 = 350\n      - 2 of item 4: 2 * 36 = 72\n      - 0 of item 5: 0 * 55 = 0\n\n    - Total Hypothetical Value = 123 + 78 + 350 + 72 = 623\n\n    - Offer: [1, 1, 3, 2, 1] (Giving 1 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 2 of item 4, and 1 of item 5 to Player 1)\n\n- **Comparison to Outside Offer**: My proposed division gives me a value of 623 which is above my outside offer and significantly better than the current offer from Player 1.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision\n\n- **Accept the Current Offer?**: No, as the value (106) is much lower than my outside offer (455).\n\n- **Walk Away?**: No, allowing for better negotiations might yield a value greater than my outside offer.\n\n- **Propose a Counteroffer?**: Yes, propose a counteroffer that will ensure a value greater than my outside offer.\n\nGiven this analysis, I will propose a counteroffer as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 3, 2, 1]}\n```",

My private values for these items are 7, 97, 10, 18, and 48. My outside offer is 404. The discount factor is 0.98.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the current offer:\n* Item 1: 1 * 7 = 7\n* Item 2: 1 * 97 = 97\n* Item 3: 3 * 10 = 30\n* Item 4: 2 * 18 = 36\n* Item 5: 1 * 48 = 48\nTotal value of the offer = 7 + 97 + 30 + 36 + 48 = 218\n\nSince it's round 2, the discounted value of the offer is 218 * 0.98^(2-1) = 218 * 0.98 = 213.64. This is significantly less than my outside offer of 404.\n\nNow, let's consider a counteroffer. I want to maximize my value, so I want to give Player 2 as little as possible while still ensuring they don't walk away. Let's calculate my total value for all items:\n* Item 1: 4 * 7 = 28\n* Item 2: 2 * 97 = 194\n* Item 3: 8 * 10 = 80\n* Item 4: 4 * 18 = 72\n* Item 5: 1 * 48 = 48\nTotal value = 28 + 194 + 80 + 72 + 48 = 422\n\nSince the maximum value I can achieve is only slightly higher than my outside offer, and since it is Round 2, there isn't much room to negotiate to make a significant profit above my outside offer (404*0.98 = 395.92). It is possible that Player 2's values are very low for item 2, which makes it hard to offer a deal that both of us would accept.\n\nTherefore, I will walk away and take my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. I'm Player 1, and I have the first move. I want to maximize my value, considering my private values for each item and my outside offer.\n\nMy private values are:\n- Item 1: 93 (3 units available)\n- Item 2: 31 (9 units available)\n- Item 3: 68 (6 units available)\n- Item 4: 94 (4 units available)\n- Item 5: 62 (7 units available)\n\nMy outside offer is 377.\n\nSince it's the first round, there's no offer on the table. I need to make an initial offer to Player 2. A good strategy is to start with an offer that gives Player 2 slightly more than half of the total value, hoping they accept it quickly. This can be adjusted based on the remaining rounds. Let's calculate the total possible value and consider an initial offer.\n\nTotal value calculation:\n- Item 1: 3 * 93 = 279\n- Item 2: 9 * 31 = 279\n- Item 3: 6 * 68 = 408\n- Item 4: 4 * 94 = 376\n- Item 5: 7 * 62 = 434\nTotal Value = 279 + 279 + 408 + 376 + 434 = 1776\n\nHalf of the total value is 1776 / 2 = 888.  A slightly generous offer could be around 950.  I'll need to offer player 2 enough items to be worth at least that much to them. Since I don't know Player 2's values, I will base my initial offer based on my own valuations. This is a risk, but there's no better information to use yet.\n\nA reasonable strategy is to give away most of the items where my value is lower, and keep items where my value is higher. Let's consider the following offer to Player 2:\n\n*   Item 1: 0 (I keep 3, value 279)\n*   Item 2: 9 (I keep 0, value 0)\n*   Item 3: 0 (I keep 6, value 408)\n*   Item 4: 0 (I keep 4, value 376)\n*   Item 5: 0 (I keep 7, value 434)\n\nThis gives me a total value of 279 + 408 + 376 + 434 = 1497. Which is significantly more than my outside offer of 377. I will offer all of item 2, and some of item 5 to Player 2, attempting to reach a value of around 377 for me, keeping more of the high-value items.\n\nLet's adjust the offer. Offer 2 units of item 5 to Player 2:\n*   Item 1: 0 (I keep 3, value 279)\n*   Item 2: 9 (I keep 0, value 0)\n*   Item 3: 0 (I keep 6, value 408)\n*   Item 4: 0 (I keep 4, value 376)\n*   Item 5: 2 (I keep 5, value 310)\n\nThis gives me a total value of 279 + 408 + 376 + 310 = 1373. Still too high. I'll offer 2 units of item 4 as well.\n*   Item 1: 0 (I keep 3, value 279)\n*   Item 2: 9 (I keep 0, value 0)\n*   Item 3: 0 (I keep 6, value 408)\n*   Item 4: 2 (I keep 2, value 188)\n*   Item 5: 2 (I keep 5, value 310)\n\nThis gives me a total value of 279 + 408 + 188 + 310 = 1185. Still very high.\n\nLet's be more aggressive, offer:\n*   Item 1: 0 (I keep 3, value 279)\n*   Item 2: 5 (I keep 4, value 124)\n*   Item 3: 0 (I keep 6, value 408)\n*   Item 4: 0 (I keep 4, value 376)\n*   Item 5: 4 (I keep 3, value 186)\n\nThis gives me a total value of 279 + 124 + 408 + 376 + 186 = 1373.\n\nLet's start by offering:\nItem 1: 0\nItem 2: 4\nItem 3: 0\nItem 4: 0\nItem 5: 4\n\nValue: 3*93 + 5*31 + 6*68 + 4*94 + 3*62 = 279 + 155 + 408 + 376 + 186 = 1404\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 4, 0, 0, 4]}\n",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

This factor is used to adjust the value of future outcomes, but since we're only in Round 1, the discount factor doesn't affect the current values (gamma^0 = 1).\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current offer for me** (Player 1 offered [0, 4, 0, 0, 4]):\n  - Value of the offer if I accept:\n    - Item 1: 0 units \u00d7 72 = 0\n    - Item 2: 4 units \u00d7 32 = 128\n    - Item 3: 0 units \u00d7 66 = 0\n    - Item 4: 0 units \u00d7 97 = 0\n    - Item 5: 4 units \u00d7 97 = 388\n  - Total value = 0 + 128 + 0 + 0 + 388 = 516\n\n- **Comparison to my outside offer**: 516 (current offer) > 299 (outside offer)\n\n- Since the offer provides a value greater than my outside offer without applying any discount for future rounds, it is considered superior to simply walking away.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\n- **Should I accept the current offer?**  \nThe current offer gives me a value of 516, which is significantly higher than my outside offer of 299.\n\n- **Mistakes to avoid**: The only mistake potentially relevant here is Mistake 4 (accepting an offer worse than my outside offer), which does not apply since the current offer is better.\n\nGiven this analysis, the best action is to accept the current offer because it yields a higher payoff than my outside offer and avoids unnecessary risks or waiting in future rounds.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. I'm Player 1, and I need to make an initial offer. I want to maximize my value, but I also need to make an offer that Player 2 might accept, considering they have their own private values and outside offer.\n\nMy private values are:\nItem 1: 99\nItem 2: 47\nItem 3: 68\nItem 4: 26\nItem 5: 70\n\nMy outside offer is 304.\n\nTotal items:\nItem 1: 4\nItem 2: 4\nItem 3: 2\nItem 4: 5\nItem 5: 6\n\nI want to make an offer that is attractive enough for Player 2 to accept, but also gives me a good value. A simple starting point is to offer Player 2 half of each item. However, since the number of items is not always even, I will have to make some adjustments to create the offer. I'll start by offering Player 2 slightly less than half of items where I have high value to ensure that they accept.\nSpecifically:\nItem 1: offer 1 to Player 2, keep 3. Value to me: 3 * 99 = 297\nItem 2: offer 1 to Player 2, keep 3. Value to me: 3 * 47 = 141\nItem 3: offer 0 to Player 2, keep 2. Value to me: 2 * 68 = 136\nItem 4: offer 2 to Player 2, keep 3. Value to me: 3 * 26 = 78\nItem 5: offer 3 to Player 2, keep 3. Value to me: 3 * 70 = 210\n\nTotal value to me: 297 + 141 + 136 + 78 + 210 = 862\n\nThis is significantly larger than my outside offer of 304, so it's a good starting point.\n\nNow, let's try another offer that is more balanced:\n\nItem 1: Offer 2 to Player 2, keep 2. Value to me: 2 * 99 = 198\nItem 2: Offer 2 to Player 2, keep 2. Value to me: 2 * 47 = 94\nItem 3: Offer 1 to Player 2, keep 1. Value to me: 1 * 68 = 68\nItem 4: Offer 2 to Player 2, keep 3. Value to me: 3 * 26 = 78\nItem 5: Offer 3 to Player 2, keep 3. Value to me: 3 * 70 = 210\n\nTotal value to me: 198 + 94 + 68 + 78 + 210 = 648\n\nThis is a better starting point in terms of fairness.\n\nLet's calculate one more offer where I favor items I value high.\n\nItem 1: Offer 1 to Player 2, keep 3. Value to me: 3 * 99 = 297\nItem 2: Offer 2 to Player 2, keep 2. Value to me: 2 * 47 = 94\nItem 3: Offer 0 to Player 2, keep 2. Value to me: 2 * 68 = 136\nItem 4: Offer 2 to Player 2, keep 3. Value to me: 3 * 26 = 78\nItem 5: Offer 3 to Player 2, keep 3. Value to me: 3 * 70 = 210\n\nTotal value to me: 297 + 94 + 136 + 78 + 210 = 815. This is higher than the balanced offer, but also more risky.\n\nI'll stick with the slightly less balanced offer to maximize the chance of acceptance and get a good value.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 0, 2, 3]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Walking away guarantees me a value of 913, which is higher. To maximize my outcome, I need to propose a counteroffer or walk away if a better deal can't be negotiated.\n\nLet's propose a counteroffer that aims to ensure my value is above 913 or close to it, assuming Player 1 has a reasonable outside offer or willingness to negotiate.\n\n#### Possible Counteroffer\nLet's calculate a potential counteroffer where I try to maximize my value while keeping enough for Player 1 to consider the offer:\nOffer [0, 4, 0, 2, 3] to Player 1 (meaning I keep [4, 0, 2, 3, 3]).\n\n- My value calculation:\n  - Item 1: 4 \u00d7 97 = 388\n  - Item 2: 0 \u00d7 6 = 0\n  - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 83 = 166\n  - Item 4: 3 \u00d7 68 = 204\n  - Item 5: 3 \u00d7 36 = 108\n- Total value = 388 + 0 + 166 + 204 + 108 = 866\n\nWhile 866 is still below 913, attempting a better division of items to reach precisely or above 913 likely won't satisfy Player 1 based on typical negotiation distributions. Since the counteroffer value doesn't exceed my outside offer, an ideal approach would be to walk away unless Player 1 later offers a more favorable deal.\n\n### Decision\nBased on my calculations and strategic assessment, I'll propose the following counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 4, 0, 2, 3]}",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

I want to get more than that from this negotiation.\nSince there is no current offer, I must make the first offer.\nTo decide what to offer, I need to estimate the value of each item to Player 2. Since I don't know their values, a reasonable starting point is to assume they are similar to mine or at least within a reasonable range. Another tactic is to offer a \"fair\" split initially and see how the other player responds.\nA \"fair\" split could be something close to a 50/50 split of the total value, or giving the other player enough to be just above their unknown outside option. Given the uncertainty, I will start with a relatively generous offer to try and get a deal done quickly and avoid the discounting.\n\nLet's aim to give Player 2 roughly half of the total value that both players could achieve *if* the value to the other player was the same as my values (1338) plus my outside offer of 768 to see if an early deal can be achieved. That value would be (1338+768) = 2106 / 2 = 1053.\n\nI can offer the player such that the approximate \"value\" that they receive, based on my values, exceeds this value. This will be a good opening offer since I have no information on their valuation of each good.\nLets try offering the following to Player 2:\n3 units of item 1\n2 units of item 2\n1 units of item 3\n2 units of item 4\n2 units of item 5\n\nThis implies that I retain:\n3 units of item 1\n1 units of item 2\n1 units of item 3\n2 units of item 4\n1 units of item 5\n\nThis means Player 2 gets a value of:\n(3 * 79) + (2 * 96) + (1 * 83) + (2 * 65) + (2 * 50) = 237 + 192 + 83 + 130 + 100 = 742\n\nWhile I retain a value of:\n(3 * 79) + (1 * 96) + (1 * 83) + (2 * 65) + (1 * 50) = 237 + 96 + 83 + 130 + 50 = 596.\nThis is less than my outside option of 768.\n\nSo, let me make a different offer:\n\nOffer:\n2 units of item 1\n1 unit of item 2\n1 unit of item 3\n2 units of item 4\n1 units of item 5\n\nThen I retain:\n4 units of item 1\n2 unit of item 2\n1 unit of item 3\n2 units of item 4\n2 units of item 5\n\nPlayer 2 gets:\n(2 * 79) + (1 * 96) + (1 * 83) + (2 * 65) + (1 * 50) = 158 + 96 + 83 + 130 + 50 = 517\n\nWhile I retain:\n(4 * 79) + (2 * 96) + (1 * 83) + (2 * 65) + (2 * 50) = 316 + 192 + 83 + 130 + 100 = 821\n\nThis is more than my outside offer.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

Since this is round 1, it doesn't affect the current values. It will come into play for rounds 2 and 3.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n1. **Current Offer**:\n   - Offer to me: [2, 1, 1, 2, 1]\n     - Value from items:\n       - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 55 = 110\n       - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 26 = 26\n       - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 42 = 42\n       - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 46 = 92\n       - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 94 = 94\n     - Total value = 110 + 26 + 42 + 92 + 94 = 364\n\n2. **Comparison to Outside Offer**:\n   - The current offer gives me a total value of 364.\n   - My outside offer value is 911.\n   - The current offer is significantly lower than my outside offer.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\n- **Should I Accept the Current Offer?**\n  - No, because 364 < 911. Accepting the current offer would result in mistake 4 (Accepting an offer worse than the outside offer).\n\n- **Should I Walk Away?**\n  - Walking away is a valid option if a better outcome can't be negotiated. However, it's only round 1, so I can still try to negotiate a better deal.\n\n- **Propose a Counteroffer**:\n  - To reach an outcome better than the outside offer, I need at least 911 / (base value per unit) from the current items. I'll aim for a distribution where my total value is at least equal to 911.\n\n### Counteroffer Calculation:\nI'll make an offer to Player 1 that maximizes my value by keeping items with the highest values.\n\n   - Proposed units for me: [4, 2, 1, 2, 2]\n     - Value:\n       - 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 55 = 220\n       - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 26 = 52\n       - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 42 = 42\n       - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 46 = 92\n       - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 94 = 188\n     - Total value = 220 + 52 + 42 + 92 + 188 = 594\n\nGiven that distributing more than this does not increase the value enough to meet my outside offer, and the values fall short, I will make the best possible offer in order to close upon a favorable negotiation. \n\nCounteroffer to Player 1: [2, 1, 1, 2, 1], which implies a fair exchange for this negotiation phase.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 1, 1, 2, 1]}\n```\n\nIf this isn't accepted, the best action next round might be to walk, depending upon if there is no improvement that surpasses the outside offer value.",

My valuation of this offer is:\n   (4 * 79) + (1 * 96) + (1 * 83) + (2 * 65) + (1 * 50) = 316 + 96 + 83 + 130 + 50 = 675\n\n2. **Consider the discount factor:** Since we are in round 2, the discount factor is 0.98^(2-1) = 0.98. Therefore, the present value of accepting this offer is 675 * 0.98 = 661.5\n\n3. **Compare to my outside offer:** My outside offer is 768. Since 661.5 < 768, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\n4. **Consider a counteroffer:** A counteroffer is only useful if it leads to a deal that is better than my outside offer. Because there is only one round remaining and my discount rate is high, I will aim for a more ambitious counteroffer that gives me most of the items. My total value for all items is 1338. 0.98 * 1338 = 1311.24, so I need to make sure my offer will be accepted and has a value close to my total value. \n\n5. **Craft a counteroffer:**\nI will offer the other player a small amount of each item: [1, 0, 0, 1, 0].

Walking away is an option, but I could also propose a counteroffer that aims to maximize my current value while being realistic in getting Player 1 to accept.\n\n- **Potential Counteroffers**:\n  - To make a counteroffer that is better for me than just walking away, I should aim to get at least 911 in present value.\n  - Let's consider offering [2, 1, 1, 2, 2] to Player 1:\n\n  Calculation of my total value:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{align*}\n  4 \\text{ units of item 1} & = 4 \\times 55 = 220 \\\\\n  2 \\text{ units of item 2} & = 2 \\times 26 = 52 \\\\\n  1 \\text{ unit of item 3} & = 1 \\times 42 = 42 \\\\\n  2 \\text{ units of item 4} & = 2 \\times 46 = 92 \\\\\n  1 \\text{ unit of item 5} & = 1 \\times 94 = 94 \\\\\n  \\end{align*}\n  \\]\n  Total value = 220 + 52 + 42 + 92 + 94 = 500\n\n  However, this value, even accounting a similar discount factor, is again far below 911. Given my high outside offer value, I'll adjust my counteroffer further:\n  Let's make a reasonable counteroffer that could likely be accepted while being advantageous compared to walking away (considering discounted value):\n\n- **New Proposed Counteroffer**: [3, 1, 0, 2, 0] to Player 1.\n\n  - **My value**:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{align*}\n  3 \\text{ units of item 1} & = 3 \\times 55 = 165 \\\\\n  2 \\text{ units of item 2} & = 2 \\times 26 = 52 \\\\\n  2 \\text{ units of item 4} & = 2 \\times 46 = 92 \\\\\n  3 \\text{ units of item 5} & = 3 \\times 94 = 282 \\\\\n  \\end{align*}\n  \\]\n  Total = 165 + 52 + 92 + 282 = 591\n\nGiven this reasoning, acknowledging that accepting proposals lower than 911 doesn't meet my guaranteed fallback, a calculated counteroffer seems reasonable:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 1, 0, 2, 0]}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

                    "response": "To determine the best action, let's go through the analysis step by step:\n\n1) **Current Situation:**\n   - My outside offer value: 832\n   - My values for the items are:\n     - Item 1: 5 per unit\n     - Item 2: 31 per unit\n     - Item 3: 27 per unit\n     - Item 4: 99 per unit\n     - Item 5: 13 per unit\n   - The total pool of items consists of:\n     - 3 units of item 1\n     - 2 units of item 2\n     - 7 units of item 3\n     - 7 units of item 4\n     - 1 unit of item 5\n   - The discount factor influences future offers by reducing their present value. If I accept later, the value is multiplied by 0.98^(r-1), where r is the round number.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n   - Current offer from Player 1: [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n     - My value if I accept it:\n       - 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 5 = 0\n       - 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 31 = 0\n       - 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 27 = 0\n       - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 99 = 99\n       - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 13 = 0\n     - Total value = 99\n   - Compare this to the outside offer value of 832. Accepting the current offer gives me a value significantly less than my outside offer.\n   \n   Since it is unlikely that Player 1 will accept a division that heavily favors me, let's consider a more balanced counteroffer. Ideally, I want to propose something that is better for me than my outside offer while keeping it reasonable enough for Player 1 to consider.\n\n   One possible counteroffer:\n   - Offer Player 1: [0, 0, 2, 3, 0]\n     - I keep: [3, 2, 5, 4, 1] - [0, 0, 2, 3, 0] = [3, 2, 5, 4, 1]\n     - My value:\n       - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15\n       - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 31 = 62\n       - 5 units of item 3 = 5 \u00d7 27 = 135\n       - 4 units of item 4 = 4 \u00d7 99 = 396\n       - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 13 = 13\n     - Total value = 621, which is less than my outside offer, making this particular counteroffer unviable.\n\n   Let's try a more advantageous division:\n   - Offer Player 1: [0, 0, 2, 2, 0]\n     - I keep: [3, 2, 5, 5, 1]\n     - My value:\n       - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15\n       - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 31 = 62\n       - 5 units of item 3 = 5 \u00d7 27 = 135\n       - 5 units of item 4 = 5 \u00d7 99 = 495\n       - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 13 = 13\n     - Total value = 720, still below my outside offer.\n   \n   Since any substantial counteroffer seems insufficient compared to the outside offer, it seems optimal for me to walk away. Nonetheless, a mathematically feasible offer that doesn't inherently appear egregious is better for maintaining negotiation integrity.\n\n   Given my situation, though, proposing anything that passes for a strategic maneuver while understanding I'll inevitably resort to my outside offer unless Player 1 cooperates more generously seems best practice.\n\n3) **Make a Decision:**\n   - Given the calculations, I should WALK, because any worthy counteroffer still doesn't exceed my outside offer value. Thus ensuring strategic integrity within the negotiation process without subjugating oneself to implausible efforts.\n\n   Therefore, my action based on these results is:\n   ```json\n   {\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n   ```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's start by outlining my goals and strategy. I want to maximize my payoff, considering my private values, the discount factor, and my outside offer of 799. Since I am Player 1 and it's the first round, I get to make the first offer. I want to make an offer that Player 2 is likely to accept (or at least counter), but also heavily favors me.\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\n1. **Calculate my total value:**\n   - Item 1: 3 * 47 = 141\n   - Item 2: 3 * 52 = 156\n   - Item 3: 8 * 62 = 496\n   - Item 4: 3 * 21 = 63\n   - Item 5: 4 * 74 = 296\n   - Total value: 141 + 156 + 496 + 63 + 296 = 1152\n\n2. **Consider an extreme offer:** I could offer Player 2 almost nothing. For example, offering Player 2 0 units of each item. This would leave me with a value of 1152. However, this is likely to be rejected.\n\n3. **Consider a slightly more generous offer:** To increase the chances of Player 2 accepting or at least countering, I need to offer them something of value. A simple approach is to offer Player 2 a small fixed proportion of each item.\n\n4. **Crafting a specific offer:** I will offer player 2 a small amount of each item such that my remaining amount exceeds my outside option. I'll offer the minimum non-zero amount of each item to make it more likely for Player 2 to counter than to WALK. I will offer 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 1 unit of item 5. This gives player 2:\n   - Item 1: 1 * value_2_item_1\n   - Item 2: 1 * value_2_item_2\n   - Item 3: 2 * value_2_item_3\n   - Item 4: 1 * value_2_item_4\n   - Item 5: 1 * value_2_item_5\n   \n   For me, this results in keeping:\n   - Item 1: 2 * 47 = 94\n   - Item 2: 2 * 52 = 104\n   - Item 3: 6 * 62 = 372\n   - Item 4: 2 * 21 = 42\n   - Item 5: 3 * 74 = 222\n   - Total value: 94 + 104 + 372 + 42 + 222 = 834\n\n   This is above my outside offer of 799, so it is a valid offer.\n\n5. **Final Action:** I will make the counteroffer [1, 1, 2, 1, 1]\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 2, 1, 1]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Therefore, accepting the current offer is not beneficial. \n\nI need to construct a counteroffer where my total value is much higher. For instance, aiming to keep:\n- 2 units of item 1\n- 2 units of item 2\n- 6 units of item 3\n- 2 units of item 4\n- 3 units of item 5\n\nCalculating the values:\n- Value from 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 44 = 88\n- Value from 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 55 = 110\n- Value from 6 units of item 3 = 6 \u00d7 70 = 420\n- Value from 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 91 = 182\n- Value from 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126\n- My total value from this division = 88 + 110 + 420 + 182 + 126 = 926\n\nThis is still lower than 1292, but making a strong initial counteroffer is a strategic move to try to capture higher value over potential subsequent rounds while not walking away at first.\n\nThus, my action is to make a counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 2, 1, 1]}\n```\n\nNote: The offer in the code above should be reflective of what Player 1 receives. I will retain:\n- 2 units of item 1, so I offer them 1 unit.\n- 2 units of item 2, offering them 1 unit.\n- 6 units of item 3, offering them 2 units.\n- 2 units of item 4, offering them 1 unit.\n- 3 units of item 5, offering them 1 unit.\nThis corresponds to the analysis above, where Player 1\u2019s received amounts are computed by subtracting what I retain from the total available.",

This means I would receive 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the value of this offer to me:\n* 1 unit of item 1: 1 * 47 = 47\n* 1 unit of item 2: 1 * 52 = 52\n* 2 units of item 3: 2 * 62 = 124\n* 1 unit of item 4: 1 * 21 = 21\n* 1 unit of item 5: 1 * 74 = 74\nTotal value = 47 + 52 + 124 + 21 + 74 = 318\n\nNow, I need to consider the discount factor. Since it is round 2, the discount factor is 0.98^(2-1) = 0.98.\n\nSo, the present value of accepting this offer is 318 * 0.98 = 311.64\n\nThis value (311.64) is less than my outside offer of 799. Therefore, accepting the offer is not a good idea. I need to either walk away or make a counteroffer.\n\nLet's consider what a reasonable counteroffer would be. Since Player 2's initial offer was the same as what is on the table, I can assume that they value items similarly to me. I want to get as close to my outside offer of 799 as possible. Also, since this is round 2, a counteroffer needs to be somewhat reasonable for player 2 to consider it.\n\nLet's try offering Player 2 the following: [0, 0, 4, 0, 0].\nThis means I would get 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5.\nThe value of this allocation to me would be:\n* 3 units of item 1: 3 * 47 = 141\n* 3 units of item 2: 3 * 52 = 156\n* 4 units of item 3: 4 * 62 = 248\n* 3 units of item 4: 3 * 21 = 63\n* 4 units of item 5: 4 * 74 = 296\nTotal value = 141 + 156 + 248 + 63 + 296 = 904\n\nConsidering the discount factor, this would be 904 * 0.98 = 885.92. This is greater than my outside offer of 799.\n\nSo, a counteroffer of [0, 0, 4, 0, 0] is a good option.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 4, 0, 0]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1292. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 906 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

This means the value of the deal decreases if it goes to the next round. Current round is 2, thus the discount effect is slightly lower than the original values.\n\n2) Assess the value of the current offer and potential counteroffers:\n   - Current offer: [0, 0, 4, 0, 0]\n     - Value = 0 \u00d7 44 (item 1) + 0 \u00d7 55 (item 2) + 4 \u00d7 70 (item 3) + 0 \u00d7 91 (item 4) + 0 \u00d7 42 (item 5) = 280\n     - Adjusted value with discount (round 2): 280 \u00d7 0.98 = 274.4\n\n   - Compare current offer to outside offer:\n     - Current offer value (274.4) is much lower than my outside offer (1292).\n\n3) Assess potential counteroffers:\n   - I need to propose a counteroffer that is more beneficial to me compared to both the current offer and my outside offer.\n\n   - Possible counteroffer:\n     - To make a beneficial counteroffer, I would keep the units that maximize my value and propose giving units to Player 1 that are strategically less valuable for me but might still be beneficial to Player 1.\n     - Aim to keep more of the high-valued items (especially items 3 and 4).\n\n   Let me calculate a potential counteroffer where I keep more of the high-value items:\n   - Before proceeding, calculate the maximum value I could potentially get:\n     - Full value of items for me (if I kept all): \n       - Item 1: 3 \u00d7 44 = 132\n       - Item 2: 3 \u00d7 55 = 165\n       - Item 3: 8 \u00d7 70 = 560\n       - Item 4: 3 \u00d7 91 = 273\n       - Item 5: 4 \u00d7 42 = 168\n       - Total: 1298\n\n   - A beneficial counteroffer might look like:\n     - Offer 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 2 units of item 5.\n     - My kept share:\n       - 2 units of item 1: 88\n       - 2 units of item 2: 110\n       - 4 units of item 3: 280\n       - 2 units of item 4: 182\n       - 2 units of item 5: 84\n     - Total: 744\n     - Discounted value (rounded): 744 \u00d7 0.98 = 729.12\n\n   - This potential offer value is greater than the current offer value after discounting, but still not as high as the outside offer. Assuming that further rounds would complicate negotiation due to the discount factor, I will instead need to consider simply rejecting or walking away.\n\n4) Make a decision:\n   - Rejecting or walking away is the safest choice since all analyzed offers are below my guaranteed fallback (1292).\n   - Given that the current offer from Player 1 is substantially below my fallback offer and any reasonable counteroffer would not reach that height, walking away ensures I achieve no less than my guaranteed value with certainty.\n\nConsidering all the above steps, my action is:\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

This is round 2, so the discount factor is 0.98^(2-1) = 0.98.\nDiscounted value of the offer = 644 * 0.98 = 631.12\n\nMy outside offer is 1101. Since the discounted value of the current offer (631.12) is less than my outside offer, accepting is not a good option.\n\nI need to decide whether to WALK or make a COUNTEROFFER. Let's consider a possible counteroffer. I want to maximize my value, so I should try to keep as much of the high-value items (2 and 3) as possible, while giving up more of the low-value items (4 and 5). I also want to consider that it's Round 2 and that Player 2 might just walk away if I make a very unfavorable offer to them.\n\nHere's what I have available to offer:\n- Item 1: 11 units\n- Item 2: 2 units\n- Item 3: 3 units\n- Item 4: 2 units\n- Item 5: 3 units\n\nI will try to offer a deal where I get more of items 1, 2, and 3. Let's try offering [5, 0, 0, 1, 1].  This means I give Player 2:\n- 5 units of item 1\n- 0 units of item 2\n- 0 units of item 3\n- 1 unit of item 4\n- 1 unit of item 5\n\nThis leaves me with:\n- Item 1: 6 units (11 - 5)\n- Item 2: 2 units (2 - 0)\n- Item 3: 3 units (3 - 0)\n- Item 4: 1 units (2 - 1)\n- Item 5: 2 units (3 - 1)\n\nThe value of this to me is:\n- 6 * 71 = 426\n- 2 * 96 = 192\n- 3 * 80 = 240\n- 1 * 31 = 31\n- 2 * 11 = 22\nTotal value = 426 + 192 + 240 + 31 + 22 = 911\n\nDiscounted value = 911 * 0.98 = 892.78\n\nThis is still lower than my outside option, so let's adjust. I need to get more items or offer less to Player 2.\n\nLet's try giving [4, 0, 0, 1, 1] to Player 2.\nThis leaves me with:\n- Item 1: 7\n- Item 2: 2\n- Item 3: 3\n- Item 4: 1\n- Item 5: 2\n\nMy value:\n- 7*71 = 497\n- 2*96 = 192\n- 3*80 = 240\n- 1*31 = 31\n- 2*11 = 22\nTotal value = 982\nDiscounted value = 982 * 0.98 = 962.36\n\nStill lower.\n\nLet's offer [3,0,0,0,0]. This gives me:\n- 8 * 71 = 568\n- 2 * 96 = 192\n- 3 * 80 = 240\n- 2 * 31 = 62\n- 3 * 11 = 33\nTotal value = 1095\nDiscounted value = 1095 * 0.98 = 1073.1\n\nStill lower, but closer! My outside offer is 1101.\n\nLet's be greedy and offer [0,0,0,0,0]. My value is 1308. Discounted value is 1308*.98 = 1281.84.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 253. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player2, 2 units of each item (keeping 1 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 645 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's start by outlining my goals and strategy. My objective is to maximize my discounted value from this negotiation, taking into account my private values and outside offer. Since this is the first round, I need to make an initial offer. I want to make an offer that is attractive enough to Player 2 that they might accept it, but also leaves me with a good portion of the items, exceeding my outside option.\n\nMy values are:\nItem 1: 47 (3 units)\nItem 2: 13 (2 units)\nItem 3: 22 (2 units)\nItem 4: 76 (5 units)\nItem 5: 57 (4 units)\n\nMy outside offer: 253\n\nI will start by considering a relatively generous offer to Player 2, giving them approximately half the total value. Let's start by giving them half of each item rounded to the nearest integer:\n\nItem 1: 1 unit to Player 2, 2 units for me\nItem 2: 1 unit to Player 2, 1 unit for me\nItem 3: 1 unit to Player 2, 1 unit for me\nItem 4: 2 units to Player 2, 3 units for me\nItem 5: 2 units to Player 2, 2 units for me\n\nValue to me:\n(2 * 47) + (1 * 13) + (1 * 22) + (3 * 76) + (2 * 57) = 94 + 13 + 22 + 228 + 114 = 471\n\nThis is significantly higher than my outside offer of 253, so it's a good starting point.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 2, 2]}\n",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 2, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 2, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To determine my best course of action, let's analyze the current situation using the provided information.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n   - **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 187.\n   \n   - **Values of the Items:**\n     - Item 1: 99 per unit \n     - Item 2: 66 per unit \n     - Item 3: 76 per unit \n     - Item 4: 87 per unit \n     - Item 5: 59 per unit \n\n   - **Total Pool of Items:** \n     - 3 units of Item 1\n     - 2 units of Item 2\n     - 2 units of Item 3\n     - 5 units of Item 4\n     - 4 units of Item 5\n   \n   - **Discount Factor Influence:** The discount rate is 0.98, but since this is round 1, the value of an accepted offer is not discounted (since \\( \\text{gamma}^{r-1} = \\text{gamma}^{0} = 1 \\)).\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n\n   - **Current Offer to Me:** [1, 1, 1, 2, 2]\n     - Value for me:\n       - 1 unit of Item 1: 1 \u00d7 99 = 99\n       - 1 unit of Item 2: 1 \u00d7 66 = 66\n       - 1 unit of Item 3: 1 \u00d7 76 = 76\n       - 2 units of Item 4: 2 \u00d7 87 = 174\n       - 2 units of Item 5: 2 \u00d7 59 = 118\n     - Total Value = 99 + 66 + 76 + 174 + 118 = 533\n\n   - **Comparison to Outside Offer:** The current offer is worth 533 to me, which is significantly higher than my outside offer of 187.\n\n3) **Make a Decision:**\n\n   - **Should I Accept?** The current offer (533) is much greater than my outside offer (187), and since this offer's value is not discounted in round 1, it is a very favorable offer compared to my fallback position.\n   \n   - **Should I Walk Away?** No, walking away would result in a lower value (187) than this deal (533).\n\n   - **Should I Propose a Counteroffer?** There is little incentive to counteroffer when I\u2019m already getting a significantly higher value than my outside offer and in the first round without any discount effect. Making a counteroffer risks making Mistake 2 or offering less favorable terms, resulting in Mistake 1.\n\nGiven this analysis, the best action is to ACCEPT the current offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",
