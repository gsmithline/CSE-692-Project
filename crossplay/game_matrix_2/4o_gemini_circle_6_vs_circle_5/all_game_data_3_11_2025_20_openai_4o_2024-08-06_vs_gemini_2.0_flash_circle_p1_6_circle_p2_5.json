This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** 382\n*   **Item values:** Item 1: 44, Item 2: 56, Item 3: 87, Item 4: 95, Item 5: 62\n*   **Total items:** Item 1: 3, Item 2: 2, Item 3: 3, Item 4: 5, Item 5: 4\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.98. This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 98% of its value in round 1, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 96.04% (0.98^2) of its value in round 1.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n    *   Item 2: 2 - 1 = 1 unit\n    *   Item 3: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n    *   Item 4: 5 - 1 = 4 units\n    *   Item 5: 4 - 1 = 3 units\n\n    My value for this offer is:\n    (2 * 44) + (1 * 56) + (2 * 87) + (4 * 95) + (3 * 62) = 88 + 56 + 174 + 380 + 186 = 884\n\n    Since 884 > 382, accepting this offer is better than walking away immediately.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I want to find a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer, and also maximizes my gains. I will explore a few options, keeping in mind I want to avoid offering nothing or everything.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince the current offer is significantly better than my outside offer, I am inclined to accept it. However, let me briefly explore a counteroffer to see if I can do better. The current offer gives Player 1: [1,1,1,1,1]. I could offer them something slightly more favorable to see if they accept. However, the fact that the current offer is already highly beneficial to me, combined with the discount factor, makes me lean towards accepting it.\n\nLet's consider offering Player 1 [1, 1, 1, 2, 2]\nThis means I keep:\n* Item 1: 3-1 = 2 units\n* Item 2: 2-1 = 1 unit\n* Item 3: 3-1 = 2 units\n* Item 4: 5-2 = 3 units\n* Item 5: 4-2 = 2 units\n\nMy value would be:\n2 * 44 + 1 * 56 + 2 * 87 + 3 * 95 + 2 * 62 = 88 + 56 + 174 + 285 + 124 = 727. This is still significantly better than my outside offer but less than the current offer.\n\nLet's consider offering Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nThis is mistake 3.\n\nWith the current offer at 884, any offer better than that for me requires more risk of losing value with the discount factor. Therefore, it is best to accept the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

I'll explore different allocation strategies and select one that maximizes my retained value while also considering what might entice Player 2.\n\n#### Calculating Total Values\n\nThe goal is to propose an offer where my resultant value is greater than 115. Let's try the following division as a potential offer to Player 2:\n\n- Offer Player 2: [0 units of Item 1, 3 units of Item 2, 2 units of Item 3, 1 unit of Item 4, 0 units of Item 5]\n\nMy retained items would be: \n- 3 units of Item 1\n- 3 units of Item 2\n- 2 units of Item 3\n- 0 units of Item 4\n- 1 unit of Item 5\n\nCalculating my total value:\n- 3 units of Item 1: 3 \u00d7 78 = 234\n- 3 units of Item 2: 3 \u00d7 40 = 120\n- 2 units of Item 3: 2 \u00d7 36 = 72\n- 0 units of Item 4: 0 \u00d7 4 = 0\n- 1 unit of Item 5: 1 \u00d7 75 = 75\n- Total value = 501\n\n501 is greater than my outside offer of 115, making this an acceptable starting point that avoids suboptimal mistakes.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nGiven the above calculations and preparation, I will proceed with the following action:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 2, 1, 0]}\n```\n\nThis initial counteroffer utilizes my high-value items and aims to set a strong footing in the negotiation, allowing for potential future adjustments based on Player 2\u2019s response.",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 42. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 687 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    50 x 0 + 86 x 0 + 48 x 0 + 9 x 0 + 36 x 1\n    which is 36 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 42. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 3, 2, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 3, 2, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 42\n*   **My values of the items:** item 1: 50, item 2: 86, item 3: 48, item 4: 9, item 5: 36\n*   **Total pool of items:** item 1: 3, item 2: 6, item 3: 4, item 4: 1, item 5: 1\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.98. This means that accepting an offer later in the game is slightly less valuable than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [0, 3, 2, 1, 0]. This means I get 0 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5. The other player gets the rest. This gives the following to me:\n    *   0 units of item 1: 0 * 50 = 0\n    *   3 units of item 2: 3 * 86 = 258\n    *   2 units of item 3: 2 * 48 = 96\n    *   0 units of item 4: 0 * 9 = 0\n    *   1 unit of item 5: 1 * 36 = 36\n    *   Total value: 0 + 258 + 96 + 0 + 36 = 390\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer's value to me (390) is significantly greater than my outside offer (42). Therefore, accepting this offer would be much better than walking away.\n\n*   **Consider a potential counteroffer:** Let's consider a counteroffer where I keep all the items for myself and offer nothing. This would have a value of 903 to me (3*50 + 6*86 + 4*48 + 1*9 + 1*36).\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\nSince the current offer gives me a value of 390, which is much greater than my outside offer of 42, accepting is better than walking away. However, it might be possible to get an even better deal, as the total value of items to me is 903.\nThe current offer requires me to give the following to Player 1: 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 0 unit of item 5.\n\nI will offer the following counteroffer: [1, 5, 3, 1, 1]. This means I keep:\n    *   item 1: 2, which is 2 * 50 = 100\n    *   item 2: 1, which is 1 * 86 = 86\n    *   item 3: 1, which is 1 * 48 = 48\n    *   item 4: 0, which is 0 * 9 = 0\n    *   item 5: 0, which is 0 * 36 = 0\n    Total value for me: 100 + 86 + 48 + 0 + 0 = 234, which is better than my outside offer of 42.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 5, 3, 1, 1]}\n",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 345. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 897 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 2, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    88 x 0 + 31 x 0 + 56 x 2 + 70 x 1 + 54 x 3\n    which is 344 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 345. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To determine the best course of action in this negotiation scenario, I'll walk through the guided analysis:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 345.\n   - **Values of the Items:** \n     - Item 1: 88 per unit\n     - Item 2: 31 per unit\n     - Item 3: 56 per unit\n     - Item 4: 70 per unit\n     - Item 5: 54 per unit\n   - **Total Pool of Items:** \n     - 4 units of item 1\n     - 2 units of item 2\n     - 3 units of item 3\n     - 4 units of item 4\n     - 7 units of item 5\n   - **Discount Factor Influence:** The discount factor (gamma = 0.98) means the value of a deal decreases the longer we take to reach it, adjusting its present value by this factor for each subsequent round. As the rounds go on, the present value of any deal achieved decreases. Thus, earlier deals have higher present value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current Offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n   - **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to calculate potential offers to ensure they are better than my outside offer value of 345.\n     - For example, let's consider keeping [2, 1, 2, 1, 3] items:\n       - Value calculation: \n         - 2 units of item 1 = 2 * 88 = 176\n         - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 * 31 = 31\n         - 2 units of item 3 = 2 * 56 = 112\n         - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 * 70 = 70\n         - 3 units of item 5 = 3 * 54 = 162\n       - Total value = 176 + 31 + 112 + 70 + 162 = 551\n     - Comparing 551 to my outside offer of 345, this potential division gives me a higher value.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - There is no need to accept since there is no current offer.\n   - Walking away, I would receive 345.\n   - By making a careful counteroffer, I can achieve a greater value than my outside offer.\n\n   Given the need to ensure I gain more value than 345 and there is no current offer, I'll proceed with a reasonable initial offer. I'll base it not only to safeguard my value but also considering the need to leave room for negotiation, ensuring flexibility in future rounds.\n\n   **Counteroffer Proposal:**\n   - Offer Player 2: [2, 1, 1, 3, 4] (offering less than half of each item type except for item 4)\n\nThus, my chosen action is a counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 1, 3, 4]}\n```",

However, each subsequent round applies an additional 2% discount.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the value of offers\n\n1. **Current offer on the table**: [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] for me\n   - Value of accepting current offer:\n     - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 88 = 88\n     - Total value = 88\n   - Adjusted by discount factor: \\( 88 \\times 0.98 = 86.24 \\)\n   - This is far less than my outside offer of 345.\n\n2. **Potential counteroffers**: \n   - Our objective is to form a counteroffer where my value is above 345.\n\nLet's see if keeping all units for a particular item can provide enough value compared to the outside offer. I'll try a mix of keeping more valuable items.\n\n#### Trying a potential division strategy where:\n\n- **Offer [2, 0, 1, 2, 4] (keeping [2, 2, 2, 2, 3] for myself)**\n  - Value for me:\n    - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 88 = 176\n    - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 31 = 62\n    - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 56 = 112\n    - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 70 = 140\n    - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 54 = 162\n    - Total value = 652\n\n  - Value adjusted by the discount factor: \\( 652 \\times 0.98 = 639.96 \\)\n\n3. **Compare to outside offer**:\n   - 639.96 > 345\n\n### Step 3: Make a decision\n\n- **Should I accept the current offer?** No, because its value at 86.24 is less than my outside offer of 345.\n\n- **Should I walk away?** Not yet, since I can propose a better counteroffer.\n\n- **Should I propose a specific counteroffer?** Yes, propose an offer with a value greater than 345.\n\nBased on this analysis, let's make an advantageous offer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 1, 2, 4]}\n```",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 587. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 587. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 708 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 1, 3, 2, 7] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    2 x 2 + 69 x 1 + 58 x 3 + 82 x 2 + 25 x 7\n    which is 586 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 587. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 1, 3, 4]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 1, 2, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 0, 1, 2, 4]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n   - My outside offer value is 587.\n   - My values for the items are: item 1 = 2, item 2 = 69, item 3 = 58, item 4 = 82, item 5 = 25.\n   - The total pool of items is: item 1 = 4, item 2 = 2, item 3 = 3, item 4 = 4, item 5 = 7.\n   - The discount factor is 0.98. This means that accepting an offer in a later round is slightly less valuable than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [2, 0, 1, 2, 4]. This means I would receive:\n      - 2 units of item 1: 2 * 2 = 4\n      - 0 units of item 2: 0 * 69 = 0\n      - 1 units of item 3: 1 * 58 = 58\n      - 2 units of item 4: 2 * 82 = 164\n      - 4 units of item 5: 4 * 25 = 100\n      - Total value: 4 + 0 + 58 + 164 + 100 = 326\n\n   - **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (326) is less than my outside offer (587). Accepting would be a Mistake 4.\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 587. Let's consider some options, keeping in mind that I need to give Player 1 something reasonable to avoid Mistake 3 (offering nothing).  I have to give *something* to Player 1.\n\n   - If I accept the current offer from Player 1 of [2, 0, 1, 2, 4], then I give them [4-2, 2-0, 3-1, 4-2, 7-4] = [2, 2, 2, 2, 3]\n   - Let's try giving Player 1 only 1 unit of item 2. This leaves me with [4, 1, 3, 4, 7]. The value to me would be:\n     - 4 * 2 + 1 * 69 + 3 * 58 + 4 * 82 + 7 * 25 = 8 + 69 + 174 + 328 + 175 = 754\n\n   - Let's try giving Player 1 [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]. Then I would keep [4, 1, 3, 4, 7]. Value to me:\n     - 4 * 2 + 1 * 69 + 3 * 58 + 4 * 82 + 7 * 25 = 8 + 69 + 174 + 328 + 175 = 754. This is greater than my outside offer.\n\n   - Let's try offering Player 1 [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. Then I keep [3, 1, 2, 3, 6]. Value to me:\n     - 3 * 2 + 1 * 69 + 2 * 58 + 3 * 82 + 6 * 25 = 6 + 69 + 116 + 246 + 150 = 587. This is equal to my outside offer.\n\n   - Let's increase the offer to Player 1 to [1, 1, 1, 1, 2]. Then I keep [3, 1, 2, 3, 5]. Value to me:\n     - 3 * 2 + 1 * 69 + 2 * 58 + 3 * 82 + 5 * 25 = 6 + 69 + 116 + 246 + 125 = 562. This is less than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   - The current offer (326) is worse than my outside offer (587). So, I should not ACCEPT.\n   - I want to offer something that gives me a value of more than 587. [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] gives me 587, so let's offer [1, 1, 1, 1, 0].\n\n   - I offer Player 1 [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]. Then I keep [3, 1, 2, 3, 7]. The value to me is:\n      - 3 * 2 + 1 * 69 + 2 * 58 + 3 * 82 + 7 * 25 = 6 + 69 + 116 + 246 + 175 = 612.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 1, 3, 2, 7] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    2 x 2 + 69 x 1 + 58 x 3 + 82 x 2 + 25 x 7\n    which is 586 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 587. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 1, 3, 4]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 1, 2, 4]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\nRound 3: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 1, 2, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 1, 2, 4]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the current situation and determine the best action for Player 2.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 587\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 2, Item 2: 69, Item 3: 58, Item 4: 82, Item 5: 25\n*   **Total items:** Item 1: 4, Item 2: 2, Item 3: 3, Item 4: 4, Item 5: 7\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.98.  Since this is round 3, the discount factor is 0.98^(3-1) = 0.98^2 = 0.9604\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 2, 1, 2, 4].

Since this is the last round, any counteroffer will be treated as a walk away. This is because I cannot negotiate beyond this round.\n\nSince this is round 3, there is no point making a counteroffer, since it will be interpreted as a walk away. Therefore, I must compare my outside offer with the value of accepting the current offer, discounted.\n\n4) **Decision:**\n\nThe discounted value of accepting the current offer is 443.7048, which is much lower than my outside offer of 587. Since any counteroffer is treated as a walk away, I should walk away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 768. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 777 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 7, 0, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    71 x 0 + 76 x 1 + 78 x 7 + 5 x 0 + 29 x 5\n    which is 767 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 768. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 0, 4, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 3, 1, 3, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    92 x 1 + 46 x 3 + 83 x 1 + 73 x 3 + 2 x 0\n    which is 532 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 533. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Let's calculate some potential offers:\n\n  **Proposal 1: Keep [1, 0, 1, 1, 3] and offer [0, 4, 2, 3, 1] to Player 2**:\n\n  - Value to me:\n    - Item 1: 1 \u00d7 51 = 51\n    - Item 2: 0 \u00d7 10 = 0\n    - Item 3: 1 \u00d7 44 = 44\n    - Item 4: 1 \u00d7 37 = 37\n    - Item 5: 3 \u00d7 17 = 51\n  - Total value = 183\n\n  This proposal is not valuable enough since it\u2019s less than my outside offer of 270.\n\n  **Proposal 2: Keep [1, 0, 2, 3, 3] and offer [0, 4, 1, 1, 1] to Player 2**:\n\n  - Value to me:\n    - Item 1: 1 \u00d7 51 = 51\n    - Item 2: 0 \u00d7 10 = 0\n    - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 44 = 88\n    - Item 4: 3 \u00d7 37 = 111\n    - Item 5: 3 \u00d7 17 = 51\n  - Total value = 301\n\n  This proposal is better as it is greater than my outside offer of 270.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision:\n\nBased on the analysis, Proposal 2 offers a value of 301, which is greater than my outside offer of 270. This is a viable initial offer as it is beneficial for me without crossing my threshold.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nI will proceed with Proposal 2, as it provides a value greater than my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 4, 1, 1, 1]}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 2, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    55 x 0 + 84 x 0 + 77 x 0 + 61 x 2 + 84 x 1\n    which is 206 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 207. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 2, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    55 x 0 + 84 x 0 + 77 x 0 + 61 x 2 + 84 x 1\n    which is 206 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 207. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 4, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 3, 1, 2, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 3, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 3, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

This means Player 1 gets:\n      - Item 1: 1 - 0 = 1\n      - Item 2: 4 - 3 = 1\n      - Item 3: 3 - 1 = 2\n      - Item 4: 4 - 1 = 3\n      - Item 5: 4 - 1 = 3\n\n   - My value for the current offer:\n      - 0 * 55 + 3 * 84 + 1 * 77 + 1 * 61 + 1 * 84 = 0 + 252 + 77 + 61 + 84 = 474.\n\n   - Potential Counteroffers: Let's consider a few.  It's round 2, so there's still a chance to negotiate. I want to get more than my outside offer. Since Player 1 is offering a lot of item 2, I will attempt to get more item 4 and item 5.\n\n   - Comparing to my outside offer: The current offer is worth 474, which is significantly greater than my outside offer of 207.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   - The current offer is quite good. It's much better than my outside offer.  Let's consider a counteroffer that is still better than my outside offer. I want to get more items 4 and 5.\n\nLet's examine the impact of giving [1, 1, 2, 2, 2] to Player 1. This would mean I receive [0, 3, 1, 2, 2].\nValue of [0, 3, 1, 2, 2]: 55 * 0 + 84 * 3 + 77 * 1 + 61 * 2 + 84 * 2 = 0 + 252 + 77 + 122 + 168 = 619.\n\nLet's examine the impact of giving [1, 2, 2, 3, 3] to Player 1. This would mean I receive [0, 2, 1, 1, 1].\nValue of [0, 2, 1, 1, 1]: 55 * 0 + 84 * 2 + 77 * 1 + 61 * 1 + 84 * 1 = 0 + 168 + 77 + 61 + 84 = 390.\n\nLet's examine the impact of giving [1, 3, 2, 3, 3] to Player 1. This would mean I receive [0, 1, 1, 1, 1].\nValue of [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]: 55 * 0 + 84 * 1 + 77 * 1 + 61 * 1 + 84 * 1 = 0 + 84 + 77 + 61 + 84 = 306.\n\nBased on the analysis and considering round 2, the current offer provides the highest payoff without risking the negotiation ending with the discount rate factored in the next round.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

This means delaying agreement decreases value by 2% per round for both parties.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\nSince no offer currently exists for me to accept, I will focus on creating a counteroffer that exceeds my outside offer value:\n\n- **Potential Counteroffers:**\n\n  To avoid Mistake 2, we must ensure that the value of what we keep is more than 391. Let's consider various distributions and compute their values:\n\n  a) Keep all of Item 5 and half of Items 3 and 4:\n  - Keep: [0, 0, 3, 3, 4]\n  - ***My Value Calculation:***\n    - 0 units of item 1 = 0 x 36 = 0\n    - 0 units of item 2 = 0 x 5 = 0\n    - 3 units of item 3 = 3 x 50 = 150\n    - 3 units of item 4 = 3 x 18 = 54\n    - 4 units of item 5 = 4 x 74 = 296\n  - Total Value = 0 + 0 + 150 + 54 + 296 = 500\n\nThe strategy is to keep those items that give me the highest value due to their high per-unit value. \n\n### 3) Make a Decision Based on the Analysis:\n\n- The computed total value for me in the counteroffer above is 500, which is greater than my outside offer of 391.\n\n- Therefore, my initial strategy will be proposing an offer that guarantees me a better value than my outside offer. \n\n- Given that the calculated value is significantly above my outside offer, it suggests a strong position for me to start negotiations.\n\nThus, I'll make the following counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 4, 3, 3, 0]}",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 3, 2, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    39 x 0 + 14 x 0 + 5 x 3 + 85 x 2 + 47 x 1\n    which is 232 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 235. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This means that an offer in a later round is worth slightly less than the same offer in an earlier round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** The current offer on the table is [0, 1, 2, 4, 2]. This is the number of each item offered to *me*.\n    *   Value of the current offer: (0 * 63) + (1 * 51) + (2 * 17) + (4 * 76) + (2 * 43) = 0 + 51 + 34 + 304 + 86 = 475\n    *   Since 475 > 209, accepting the current offer is better than walking away.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** We can improve our position even further if we can get player 1 to accept a better deal for us. I will look at a possible counteroffer. Because I value item 4 very highly, I want to keep as much of this item as possible. I value item 3 much less, so I am willing to give more of that item to player 1.\n* I will start with the offer [0,0,3,5,3] and assess its value. If Player 1 accepts it, I would keep [0, 1, 1, 1, 1] which would give me 0*63 + 1*51 + 1*17 + 1*76 + 1*43 = 187, which is worse than walking away, so I need to give less.\n* I will try [0,0,4,6,4]. If player 1 accepts this, I would keep [0, 1, 0, 0, 0] which would give me 1*51 = 51, this is much less than walking away, so I know I cannot give this much.\n* Perhaps an offer that gives the other player 1 less item 4 would be worth more for me than the current offer. The current offer is [0, 1, 2, 4, 2]. If I offer [0,0,3,5,3] to the other player, that would mean I keep [0, 1, 1, 1, 1] for myself. This is worth 51 + 17 + 76 + 43 = 187. This is worse than walking away. I can also calculate the current offer from player 1. Player 1 gave me 0,1,2,4,2 so they would keep 0,0,2,2,2.\n\n*   How do these values compare to my outside offer value? The current offer is significantly better than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Accepting the current offer is better than walking away.\n*   Let's try to get a better deal by giving 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 3 of item 4, 2 of item 5 to the other player. This leaves me with [0, 1, 2, 3, 2] which is worth 51 + 2*17 + 3*76 + 2*43 = 51 + 34 + 228 + 86 = 399, which is greater than walking away.\n\n    Let's try a different counteroffer: Give 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 1 of item 5 to the other player.\n    Then I would have [0, 1, 3, 4, 3], which has a value of 1*51 + 3*17 + 4*76 + 3*43 = 51 + 51 + 304 + 129 = 535.\n    This is a better offer than what is currently on the table.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 2, 1]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 3, 2, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    39 x 0 + 14 x 0 + 5 x 3 + 85 x 2 + 47 x 1\n    which is 232 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 235. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Let's consider keeping enough items such that I can exceed my outside offer value.\n\n#### Calculate Some Potential Offers\n\nIf I keep the entirety of the items, my value would be:\n- Total Value = \\( (6 \\times 61) + (3 \\times 29) + (7 \\times 20) + (6 \\times 47) + (5 \\times 76) = 1255 \\).\n  \nI should offer Player 2 a reasonable portion while still exceeding my outside offer.\n\nSuppose I make an offer where I keep:\n- 5 units of item 1\n- 2 units of item 2\n- 5 units of item 3\n- 4 units of item 4\n- 3 units of item 5\n\nCalculating my value:\n- \\( 5 \\times 61 + 2 \\times 29 + 5 \\times 20 + 4 \\times 47 + 3 \\times 76 = 305 + 58 + 100 + 188 + 228 = 879 \\).\n\nThis is less than my outside offer of 1014. Let's adjust:\n\nSuppose I keep:\n- 4 units of item 1\n- 1 unit of item 2\n- 5 units of item 3\n- 5 units of item 4\n- 4 units of item 5\n\nCalculating my value:\n- \\( 4 \\times 61 + 1 \\times 29 + 5 \\times 20 + 5 \\times 47 + 4 \\times 76 = 244 + 29 + 100 + 235 + 304 = 912 \\).\n\nThis is still less than my outside offer. However, consider this:\n\nIf I keep:\n- 5 units of item 1\n- 2 units of item 2\n- 6 units of item 3\n- 5 units of item 4\n- 4 units of item 5\n\nCalculating my value:\n- \\( 5 \\times 61 + 2 \\times 29 + 6 \\times 20 + 5 \\times 47 + 4 \\times 76 = 305 + 58 + 120 + 235 + 304 = 1022 \\).\n\nThis exceeds my outside offer. Therefore, I can propose an offer where I keep these items, offering the rest to Player 2.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nBased on the analysis, I should make an initial counteroffer giving the remaining items to Player 2, which are:\n- 1 unit of item 1\n- 1 unit of item 2\n- 1 unit of item 3\n- 1 unit of item 4\n- 1 unit of item 5\n\nThus, my action will be a counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    54 x 0 + 32 x 0 + 56 x 1 + 47 x 0 + 67 x 1\n    which is 123 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 125. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n   - My outside offer value: 125\n   - Item values: Item 1 = 54, Item 2 = 32, Item 3 = 56, Item 4 = 47, Item 5 = 67\n   - Total items: Item 1 = 6, Item 2 = 3, Item 3 = 7, Item 4 = 6, Item 5 = 5\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.98. This means that accepting an offer in a later round is slightly less valuable than accepting it now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. This means I would receive:\n      - Item 1: 1 unit * 54 = 54\n      - Item 2: 1 unit * 32 = 32\n      - Item 3: 1 unit * 56 = 56\n      - Item 4: 1 unit * 47 = 47\n      - Item 5: 1 unit * 67 = 67\n      - Total value: 54 + 32 + 56 + 47 + 67 = 256\n\n   - **Compare to outside offer:** The current offer's value (256) is much greater than my outside offer (125).\n\n   - **Consider potential counteroffers:** I need to determine if there's a counteroffer that would be even better for me. This involves figuring out how much I can reasonably ask for without Player 1 walking away.\n   Since Player 1 is offering 1 of each item, they are keeping 5 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 6 of item 3, 5 of item 4, and 4 of item 5. Since they are offering one of each item, it's more likely they value those items less. Let's see if there is a better offer I can make.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   - The current offer is significantly better than my outside offer. Therefore, walking away would be a mistake.\n   - Accepting the current offer would be a good choice, but I want to see if I can get a better deal first.\n   - Let's consider a counteroffer.\n\nCounteroffer strategy:\nI'll aim for a counteroffer that gets me a value above 256. I'll give back slightly less than I was given in the offer, so I seem cooperative and don't seem greedy.\nI'll offer Player 1 the following: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]\n\nThis means I keep:\nItem 1: 6 - 2 = 4 units * 54 = 216\nItem 2: 3 - 2 = 1 unit * 32 = 32\nItem 3: 7 - 2 = 5 units * 56 = 280\nItem 4: 6 - 2 = 4 units * 47 = 188\nItem 5: 5 - 2 = 3 units * 67 = 201\nTotal value = 216 + 32 + 280 + 188 + 201 = 917\n\nSince 917 > 125, this counteroffer is acceptable.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    54 x 0 + 32 x 0 + 56 x 1 + 47 x 0 + 67 x 1\n    which is 123 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 125. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 4, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 4, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best course of action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value is 125.\n*   My item values are: item 1 = 54, item 2 = 32, item 3 = 56, item 4 = 47, item 5 = 67.\n*   Total items: 6 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5.\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.98. This means an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 0.98 times the value of an offer accepted in round 2, and an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.98 times the value of an offer accepted in round 1.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [1, 1, 4, 0, 0]. This means I get:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 54 = 54\n    *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 32 = 32\n    *   4 units of item 3: 4 * 56 = 224\n    *   0 units of item 4: 0 * 47 = 0\n    *   0 units of item 5: 0 * 67 = 0\n    *   Total value: 54 + 32 + 224 + 0 + 0 = 310\n\n    Since this is round 2, the discounted value is 310 * 0.98 = 303.8. This is greater than my outside offer of 125.\n\n*   **Consider some counteroffers**: I want to calculate potential counteroffers and see how they compare to my outside option and current offer. To prevent mistake #2 and #4 I need to ensure the offer is better than my outside option value. To avoid mistake #1, I should not propose an offer worse than my previous one. Let's consider trying to get more units of item 5. I am offering [2, 2, 2, 2, 2] in the previous round. If I now offer [2, 2, 2, 3, 1], meaning I keep 4 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 5 unit of item 3, 3 unit of item 4, 4 unit of item 5.\n    *  4 units of item 1: 4 * 54 = 216\n    *  1 unit of item 2: 1 * 32 = 32\n    *  5 unit of item 3: 5 * 56 = 280\n    *  3 unit of item 4: 3 * 47 = 141\n    *  4 unit of item 5: 4 * 67 = 268\n    *  Total value: 216 + 32 + 280 + 141 + 268 = 937\n    *  Since this is round 2, the discounted value is 937 * 0.98 = 918.26.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer [1, 1, 4, 0, 0] gives me a value of 303.8, which is significantly greater than my outside offer of 125.\n*   Therefore, I should ACCEPT the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items.

If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

If negotiations extend beyond the first round, the discount applied would slightly reduce the future value of the negotiated outcome. In this first round, I aim to secure a value higher than my outside offer to ensure a beneficial outcome.\n\n### 2) Assess the value of offers:\n\n- **For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?**\n  Currently, there is no offer on the table. As such, my immediate focus is on constructing an initial offer.\n\n### 3) Make a decision based on the analysis.\n\nI need to propose an initial offer where my retained value exceeds my outside offer of 728. I will perform calculations for a potential allocation:\n\n#### Example counteroffer calculation:\nLet's consider keeping:\n- 2 units of Item 1\n- 5 units of Item 2\n- 2 units of Item 3\n- 3 units of Item 4\n- 1 unit of Item 5\n\nThe counteroffer to Player 2 would be:\n- 2 units of Item 1\n- 1 unit of Item 2\n- 2 units of Item 3\n- 2 units of Item 4\n- 1 unit of Item 5\n\nCalculating the total value to me with the items I keep:\n- 2 units of Item 1 = 2 \u00d7 94 = 188\n- 5 units of Item 2 = 5 \u00d7 100 = 500\n- 2 units of Item 3 = 2 \u00d7 20 = 40\n- 3 units of Item 4 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12\n- 1 unit of Item 5 = 1 \u00d7 53 = 53\n\nTotal retained value = 793\n\nSince 793 is greater than my outside offer value of 728, this is a beneficial offer to propose.\n\nThus, my action will be:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 2, 2, 1]}\n```",

This means accepting an offer in a later round is slightly less valuable.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** Player 1 is offering me [2, 1, 2, 2, 1]. This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 4 - 2 = 2\n    *   Item 2: 6 - 1 = 5\n    *   Item 3: 4 - 2 = 2\n    *   Item 4: 5 - 2 = 3\n    *   Item 5: 2 - 1 = 1\n    Value of current offer to me: (2 * 23) + (5 * 16) + (2 * 41) + (3 * 59) + (1 * 4) = 46 + 80 + 82 + 177 + 4 = 389\n\n*   **Comparison to Outside Offer:**  The current offer (389) is less than my outside offer (472). Therefore, accepting this offer would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to find an offer that gives me a value greater than 472. Let's start by considering what my value would be if I kept everything:\n    *   (4 * 23) + (6 * 16) + (4 * 41) + (5 * 59) + (2 * 4) = 92 + 96 + 164 + 295 + 8 = 655\n\n    Since the maximum value I can achieve is 655, I will start constructing a counteroffer that provides me with value greater than 472.\n    I'll try to keep the items with the highest value to myself and offer the lower value ones to the other player. This means keeping most of item 4, item 3, item 1 and offering items 2 and 5.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\nThe current offer is bad, as its value (389) is less than my outside offer (472). I should not accept it.\nWalking away is also not optimal if I can construct a better counteroffer.\n\nLet's try a counteroffer where I keep:\nItem 1: 4\nItem 2: 4\nItem 3: 4\nItem 4: 5\nItem 5: 0\nI offer:\nItem 1: 0\nItem 2: 2\nItem 3: 0\nItem 4: 0\nItem 5: 2\n\nValue = (4 * 23) + (4 * 16) + (4 * 41) + (5 * 59) + (0 * 4) = 92 + 64 + 164 + 295 + 0 = 615 which is larger than my outside offer (472).

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 472. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 472. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 429 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 3, 4, 4, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    23 x 1 + 16 x 3 + 41 x 4 + 59 x 4 + 4 x 0\n    which is 471 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 472. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Since we're in round 3, this factor is relevant but won't change the fundamental evaluation against the outside offer.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n1. **Current Offer [4, 4, 0, 0, 2]**:\n   - My potential value if I accept this offer:\n     - Item 1: 4 \u00d7 94 = 376\n     - Item 2: 4 \u00d7 100 = 400\n     - Item 3: 0 \u00d7 20 = 0\n     - Item 4: 0 \u00d7 4 = 0\n     - Item 5: 2 \u00d7 53 = 106\n     - Total value = 376 + 400 + 0 + 0 + 106 = 882\n   - Adjusted by discount: \\(882 \\times (0.98^2) = 848.9368\\)\n\n2. **Comparison**:\n   - Current offer post-discount: 848.9368\n   - My outside offer: 728\n\n3. **Counteroffers**:\n   - Any potential counteroffer must exceed the post-discount value of the current offer to Player 2 to consider. However, because it's round 3, Player 2 cannot counter further, and hence the last reasonable opportunity is to evaluate acceptance.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\n1. **Should I Accept the Current Offer?**\n   - The current offer provides a value of 848.94 (approx.) after discount, which is significantly higher than the outside offer of 728. \n\n2. **Should I Walk Away?**\n   - Walking away provides a value of 728, which is less than the current offer.\n\n3. **Propose a Counteroffer?**\n   - A counteroffer is risky as the game rules state that Player 2 cannot counter anymore, effectively treating it as a walk when they can't act further.\n\n**Conclusion**: The most advantageous action, given my evaluation, is to accept the current offer, since it provides a value higher than my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1187. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 792 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 3, 6, 7, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    21 x 2 + 42 x 3 + 45 x 6 + 68 x 7 + 88 x 3\n    which is 1178 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1187. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To determine the best course of action, I'll go through the steps outlined in the problem statement:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **What is my outside offer value?**  \n  My outside offer value is 1187.\n\n- **What are the values of the items involved?**\n  - Item 1: 3 units, value per unit = 21\n  - Item 2: 3 units, value per unit = 42\n  - Item 3: 6 units, value per unit = 45\n  - Item 4: 7 units, value per unit = 68\n  - Item 5: 3 units, value per unit = 88\n\n- **What is the total pool of items?**\n  - 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 7 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5.\n\n- **How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?**  \n  The discount factor (gamma = 0.98) reduces the value of any future deals by multiplying the value by 0.98 for each additional round we wait. Thus, it is generally more beneficial to settle earlier rather than later, assuming the value is close to or exceeds my outside offer of 1187.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?**  \n  There is no current offer on the table, so this part is not applicable.\n\n- **For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?**\n\n  Let's calculate a few scenarios to understand what might be beneficial:\n\n  1. **Keep all of item 5, half of item 4, and fair distribution of others:**  \n     - Keeping: [1, 1, 3, 3, 0]\n     - Value: \n       - 1 unit of item 1: 1 \u00d7 21 = 21\n       - 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 42 = 42\n       - 3 units of item 3: 3 \u00d7 45 = 135\n       - 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 68 = 204\n       - 3 units of item 5: 3 \u00d7 88 = 264\n     - Total value = 666\n\n  2. **Keep all of item 5, more of item 4, and distribute fairly:**\n     - Keeping: [1, 1, 3, 4, 0] \n     - Value:\n       - 1 unit of item 1: 1 \u00d7 21 = 21\n       - 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 42 = 42\n       - 3 units of item 3: 3 \u00d7 45 = 135\n       - 4 units of item 4: 4 \u00d7 68 = 272\n       - 3 units of item 5: 3 \u00d7 88 = 264\n     - Total value = 734\n\n  3. **Keep a higher portion of valuable items (target high value):**\n     - Keeping: [1, 0, 2, 5, 0]\n     - Value:\n       - 1 unit of item 1: 1 \u00d7 21 = 21 \n       - 0 units of item 2: 0 \u00d7 42 = 0\n       - 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 45 = 90\n       - 5 units of item 4: 5 \u00d7 68 = 340\n       - 3 units of item 5: 3 \u00d7 88 = 264\n     - Total value = 715\n\n  From these calculations, all these scenarios are below my outside offer value of 1187.  \n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision Based on the Analysis\n   \nSince no configuration in these scenarios of keeping some items and offering others resulted in a value exceeding or even reaching my outside offer value of 1187, the safest decision is to relinquish the negotiation and accept the outside offer.\n\n**Action:**  \n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 5, 1, 2, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    2 x 0 + 10 x 5 + 6 x 1 + 21 x 2 + 4 x 1\n    which is 102 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 104. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value is 104.\n*   My item values are: item 1 = 2, item 2 = 10, item 3 = 6, item 4 = 21, item 5 = 4.\n*   The total pool of items is: 1 unit of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n*   The discount factor is 0.98. This means that accepting an offer in a later round is slightly less valuable than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 1, 1, 2, 0]. This means I would receive:\n    *   1 unit of item 1 * 2 = 2\n    *   1 unit of item 2 * 10 = 10\n    *   1 unit of item 3 * 6 = 6\n    *   2 units of item 4 * 21 = 42\n    *   0 units of item 5 * 4 = 0\n    *   Total value of current offer = 2 + 10 + 6 + 42 + 0 = 60. This is less than my outside offer.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to create an offer that gives me a value greater than 104. Let's calculate the total value of all items if I keep them:\n    *   1 unit of item 1 * 2 = 2\n    *   5 units of item 2 * 10 = 50\n    *   2 units of item 3 * 6 = 12\n    *   2 units of item 4 * 21 = 42\n    *   1 unit of item 5 * 4 = 4\n    *   Total value if I keep everything = 2 + 50 + 12 + 42 + 4 = 110.\n\n    Now, let's try to make a counteroffer where I give Player 1 something, but still keep more than 104. I need to give them something, but not too much.\n\n    Let's try offering Player 1 [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]. In this case, I keep [1, 3, 2, 2, 1]:\n    * 1 unit of item 1 * 2 = 2\n    * 3 units of item 2 * 10 = 30\n    * 2 units of item 3 * 6 = 12\n    * 2 units of item 4 * 21 = 42\n    * 1 unit of item 5 * 4 = 4\n    * Total value to me = 2 + 30 + 12 + 42 + 4 = 90. This is lower than my outside offer, so I need to give them less or different items.\n\n    Let's try offering Player 1 [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]. In this case, I keep [1, 4, 2, 2, 1]:\n    * 1 unit of item 1 * 2 = 2\n    * 4 units of item 2 * 10 = 40\n    * 2 units of item 3 * 6 = 12\n    * 2 units of item 4 * 21 = 42\n    * 1 unit of item 5 * 4 = 4\n    * Total value to me = 2 + 40 + 12 + 42 + 4 = 100. This is still lower than my outside offer.\n\n    Let's try offering Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. In this case, I keep [1, 5, 2, 2, 1]:\n     * Total value to me = 110.\n\n     I need to give the other player something. Let's try to give them item 5: offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]. Then I keep [1, 5, 2, 2, 0]\n     * 1 unit of item 1 * 2 = 2\n     * 5 units of item 2 * 10 = 50\n     * 2 units of item 3 * 6 = 12\n     * 2 units of item 4 * 21 = 42\n     * 0 unit of item 5 * 4 = 0\n     * Total value to me = 2 + 50 + 12 + 42 + 0 = 106. This is better than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer of [1, 1, 1, 2, 0] is worth 60 to me, which is less than my outside offer of 104. So I should not ACCEPT.\n*   I can make a counteroffer of [0, 0, 0, 0, 1].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]}\n```",

My value would be:\n  - 0 units of item 1 = 0\n  - 0 units of item 2 = 0\n  - 0 units of item 3 = 0\n  - 0 units of item 4 = 0\n  - 1 unit of item 5 = 70\n  - Total value = 70\n  - Discounted present value = 70 \u00d7 0.98 = 68.6\n\n  The current offer's value (68.6) is much lower than my outside offer (347), so accepting this offer would be Mistake 4.\n\n- **Potential Counteroffers:**\n  I need to propose an offer that ensures the value I keep is greater than my outside offer, factoring in the discount. One possible counteroffer could be offering Player 2 [1, 4, 0, 2, 1], which leaves me with:\n  - 0 units of item 1 = 0\n  - 1 unit of item 2 = 67\n  - 2 units of item 3 = 88\n  - 0 units of item 4 = 0\n  - 0 units of item 5 = 0\n  - My value = 67 + 88 = 155\n  - Discounted present value = 155 \u00d7 0.98 = 151.9\n\n  This counteroffer of [1, 4, 0, 2, 1] results in a value less than my outside offer. Mistake 2 would be offering a division that results in less value than my fallback.\n\n  To align the remaining value with exceeding my outside offer even after discounts, I'll attempt another configuration.\n\n- Let's try a more advantageous division, where I maximize item 4:\n  Offer Player 2 [1, 4, 2, 0, 1], keeping:\n  - 0 units of item 1 = 0\n  - 1 unit of item 2 = 67\n  - 0 units of item 3 = 0\n  - 2 units of item 4 = 144\n  - 0 units of item 5 = 0\n  - My value = 67 + 144 = 211\n  - Discounted present value = 211 \u00d7 0.98 = 206.78\n\n  While this gives a decent configuration, still striving for better over my fallback approach, so decision might revisit.\n\n### 3) Decision:\nBoth the comparison and initial counteroffer checking informed observation on suitable and favorable margins. The ultimate choice lands around maximizing the guarantee if it exceeds the adjusted offers sentiment for negotiation.\n\nSince no proposal here aligns with greater than the fallback, confidently apply WALK decision ensuring remain betterment for extraordinary non-negotiated secure option.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 5, 6, 6, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    36 x 1 + 46 x 5 + 51 x 6 + 32 x 6 + 28 x 2\n    which is 820 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 822. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

                    "response": "To decide on the best course of action, let's first analyze the current situation:\n\n### 1) Analyze the current situation:\n\n- **My outside offer value**: 822\n\n- **Values of the items per unit**:\n  - Item 1: 36\n  - Item 2: 46\n  - Item 3: 51\n  - Item 4: 32\n  - Item 5: 28\n\n- **Total pool of items**:\n  - 2 units of item 1\n  - 5 units of item 2\n  - 7 units of item 3\n  - 6 units of item 4\n  - 2 units of item 5\n\n- **Discount factor**: The discount factor is 0.98, but since it's round 1, the factor for this round is \\(0.98^{0} = 1\\). The effect of the discount factor starts if the negotiations move to rounds 2 or 3, reducing the value of any deal made in those rounds.\n\n### 2) Assess the value of offers:\n\n- There is currently no offer on the table, so I need to propose the initial offer.\n\n- **Calculate my total value if I keep certain units**:\n\nI need a counteroffer that gives me more than my outside offer value of 822.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

This means that any deal concluded in future rounds will be worth less than if it were accepted in the current round. The value in a future round will be multiplied by 0.98 raised to the power of (r-1), where r is the round number.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n\nSince there is no current offer from Player 2, I'll need to propose an initial offer. The goal is to maximize my outcome by comparing it to my outside offer of 507.\n\n#### Evaluate Potential Offers:\n\n- **Testing an Offer:** I'll make a reasonable starting offer to Player 2 that is still better than my outside option. For example, I'll start by keeping the majority of high-value items for myself.\n\n  - **Offer 1:** Keep [2, 1, 5, 4, 2] for myself, offer [1, 1, 2, 1, 1] to Player 2.\n\n  - **Calculate My Value for This Offer:**\n    - My items: 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n    - Value: \n      - (2 \u00d7 84) = 168 from item 1 \n      - (1 \u00d7 54) = 54 from item 2\n      - (5 \u00d7 29) = 145 from item 3\n      - (4 \u00d7 74) = 296 from item 4\n      - (2 \u00d7 50) = 100 from item 5\n    - **Total Value = 763**\n\nThis offer provides a value of 763, which is significantly better than my outside offer of 507.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision Based on the Analysis:\n\nSince this offer is more advantageous to me than my outside offer, and since there\u2019s no indication of Player 2's preferences or total outside offer at this stage, it would be strategically sound to proceed with this offer as a starting point. It respects my own interests and does not violate the mistakes outlined in the negotiation strategy.\n\nTherefore, based on the current analysis, my next step is to make my initial offer to Player 2.\n\n### Action:\n\nBased on the above assessment, I propose the following counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 2, 1, 1]}\n```",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 839. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 839. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 873 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 4, 0, 2, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    81 x 5 + 64 x 4 + 37 x 0 + 68 x 2 + 41 x 1\n    which is 838 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 839. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Suppose I propose keeping [3, 3, 3, 2, 0] and offering the rest to Player 2:\n\n  - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243\n  - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 64 = 192\n  - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111\n  - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 68 = 136\n  - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 41 = 0\n\n  Total value = 243 + 192 + 111 + 136 = 682\n\n  After applying the discount for round 2:\n  Present value = 682 \u00d7 0.98 = 668.36\n\n  This is also below my outside offer value of 839.\n\n  Let's try another possible distribution: Propose keeping [4, 3, 3, 2, 1] and offering the rest to Player 2.\n\n  - 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 81 = 324\n  - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 64 = 192\n  - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111\n  - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 68 = 136\n  - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 41 = 41\n\n  Total value = 324 + 192 + 111 + 136 + 41 = 804\n\n  After applying the discount for round 2:\n  Present value = 804 \u00d7 0.98 = 787.92\n\n  This, too, is below my outside offer value of 839.\n\n### Conclusion - 3) Decision:\n\nGiven that the value of the current offer and counteroffers do not meet or exceed my outside offer, my best action in this case is to use the guaranteed value provided by my outside offer.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value is 983.\n*   My values for the items are: item 1 = 78, item 2 = 24, item 3 = 42, item 4 = 5, item 5 = 72.\n*   The total pool of items is: 7 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5.\n*   The discount factor is 0.98. This means that accepting an offer in a later round is slightly less valuable than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** The current offer on the table *to me* is [1, 4, 2, 1, 1]. This means I would receive 1 unit of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5. My value for this offer would be:\n    (1 * 78) + (4 * 24) + (2 * 42) + (1 * 5) + (1 * 72) = 78 + 96 + 84 + 5 + 72 = 335\n\n*   This value (335) is significantly less than my outside offer (983). Therefore, I should not accept this offer.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to determine what items to keep and what items to offer. I want to maximize my value while making a reasonable offer to Player 1. Let's start by figuring out what I would keep. The current offer gives me 1 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 1 of item 4 and 1 of item 5. In total there are 7 of item 1, 5 of item 2, 6 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 4 of item 5. This means Player 1 is getting 6 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 1 of item 4 and 3 of item 5.\n\n    If I kept all the items, I would have:\n    (7 * 78) + (5 * 24) + (6 * 42) + (2 * 5) + (4 * 72) = 546 + 120 + 252 + 10 + 288 = 1216\n\n    Since my outside offer is 983, I need to aim for a value above that. Let's try an offer where I keep 4 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 2 of item 4 and 4 of item 5. This yields:\n    (4 * 78) + (1 * 24) + (4 * 42) + (2 * 5) + (4 * 72) = 312 + 24 + 168 + 10 + 288 = 802\n\n    This means I would offer the other player: 3 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 0 of item 4, and 0 of item 5.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 2, 3, 2, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    71 x 1 + 1 x 2 + 27 x 3 + 99 x 2 + 78 x 1\n    which is 430 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 431. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 4, 2, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 2, 1, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 1, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Let's break down the situation step by step, as requested.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the current situation\n\n- **Outside offer value**: My outside offer is 431.\n- **Values of the items**:\n  - Item 1: 71\n  - Item 2: 1\n  - Item 3: 27\n  - Item 4: 99\n  - Item 5: 78\n- **Total pool of items**:\n  - 7 units of item 1\n  - 5 units of item 2\n  - 6 units of item 3\n  - 2 units of item 4\n  - 4 units of item 5\n\n- **Discount factor (gamma)**: 0.98. Since we are in round 2, the discount factor applied to this round is \\( 0.98^{1} \\), which is 0.98.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the value of offers\n\n- **Current offer [1, 2, 1, 0, 0]**:\n  - Units of item 1: 1 \u00d7 71 = 71\n  - Units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 1 = 2\n  - Units of item 3: 1 \u00d7 27 = 27\n  - Units of item 4: 0 \u00d7 99 = 0\n  - Units of item 5: 0 \u00d7 78 = 0\n  - Total value before discount: 71 + 2 + 27 + 0 + 0 = 100\n  - With discount for round 2: 100 \u00d7 0.98 = 98\n\n- **Comparison with outside offer**:\n  - The current offer is worth 98 to me after applying the discount factor.\n  - My outside offer is worth 431.\n  - The current offer is significantly lower than my outside offer of 431, hence it is not worthwhile to accept.\n\n- **Possible counteroffer**:\n  - My previous offer was [1, 4, 2, 1, 1], which I need to ensure isn't a mistake based on the criteria mentioned.\n  - Calculate value of my previous counteroffer to ensure it's a suitable starting point:\n    - Units I proposed to retain [6, 1, 4, 1, 3] (since I offered [1, 4, 2, 1, 1] to Player 2):\n    - Value to me:\n      - Item 1: 6 \u00d7 71 = 426\n      - Item 2: 1 \u00d7 1 = 1\n      - Item 3: 4 \u00d7 27 = 108\n      - Item 4: 1 \u00d7 99 = 99\n      - Item 5: 3 \u00d7 78 = 234\n      - Total value: 426 + 1 + 108 + 99 + 234 = 868\n      - With discount for round 2: 868 \u00d7 0.98 = 850.64\n\n  - The value of keeping [6, 1, 4, 1, 3] items is much higher than my outside offer, making it a good counteroffer.\n\n### Step 3: Make a decision\n\nBased on the above analysis, I should make a counteroffer, as the current offer is less than my outside offer and my previously proposed distribution yields a much higher value for me.\n\nIn this round, a suitable counteroffer to ensure it's in a reasonable range with my previous proposal could still be [1, 4, 2, 1, 1], or slightly adjusted. Since the slight adjustment does not substantially benefit me better than [6, 1, 4, 1, 3], I'll repeat the offer to make it easier to track negotiation moves. \n\n**Counteroffer**: Offer [1, 4, 2, 1, 1] to Player 2.\n\nMy action is:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 4, 2, 1, 1]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step to determine the best action.\n\n1. **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n   - My outside offer value is 983.\n   - My values for the items are: item 1 = 78, item 2 = 24, item 3 = 42, item 4 = 5, item 5 = 72.\n   - The total pool of items is: 7 of item 1, 5 of item 2, 6 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 4 of item 5.\n   - The discount factor is 0.98. This means that accepting an offer in round 2 is worth 0.98 times the value of accepting in round 1, and accepting in round 3 is worth 0.98 squared times the value of accepting in round 1.\n\n2. **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer:** The current offer is [1, 4, 2, 1, 1]. This means I receive 1 unit of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n     - Value of current offer: (1 * 78) + (4 * 24) + (2 * 42) + (1 * 5) + (1 * 72) = 78 + 96 + 84 + 5 + 72 = 335.\n     - Since it is round 2, discounted value of the offer is 335 * 0.98 = 328.3\n     - This is significantly less than my outside offer of 983. Therefore, accepting this offer would be a mistake.\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than my outside offer. Since Player 1 offered [1, 4, 2, 1, 1] to me, it means they keep:\n        - item 1: 7 - 1 = 6\n        - item 2: 5 - 4 = 1\n        - item 3: 6 - 2 = 4\n        - item 4: 2 - 1 = 1\n        - item 5: 4 - 1 = 3\n\n   Let's try to create a counteroffer where I keep more items and see if the value exceeds 983.\n    For example, I can try to offer Player 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    I keep all the items. My value: (7 * 78) + (5 * 24) + (6 * 42) + (2 * 5) + (4 * 72) = 546 + 120 + 252 + 10 + 288 = 1216\n    This is greater than the outside offer of 983.\n    I can try a counteroffer of [1, 2, 1, 0, 0], as in the last round. This would mean I have 6, 3, 5, 2, 4. My value is then:\n     (6 * 78) + (3 * 24) + (5 * 42) + (2 * 5) + (4 * 72) = 468 + 72 + 210 + 10 + 288 = 1048.\n    This is better than the outside offer.\n\nI will make an offer that improves my position with the expectation it will be accepted next round.\n\n3. **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   - I should not accept the current offer.\n   - I should not walk away.\n   - I should propose a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 983.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 1, 0, 0]}\n",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 2, 3, 2, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    71 x 1 + 1 x 2 + 27 x 3 + 99 x 2 + 78 x 1\n    which is 430 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 431. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 4, 2, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 2, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 4, 2, 1, 1]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [1, 2, 1, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 1, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To decide what action to take, let's analyze the situation and the offers.\n\n### 1) Analyzing the Current Situation:\n- **Outside Offer Value**: Your outside offer is valued at 431.\n- **Values of Items**:\n  - Item 1: 71 per unit\n  - Item 2: 1 per unit\n  - Item 3: 27 per unit\n  - Item 4: 99 per unit\n  - Item 5: 78 per unit\n- **Total Pool of Items**: There are 7 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5.\n- **Discount Factor**: The discount factor, gamma, is 0.98. Since we are in round 3, the value of any agreement is multiplied by \\(0.98^{(3-1)} = 0.98^2 = 0.9604\\).\n\n### 2) Assessing the Value of Offers:\n- **Current Offer to You ([1, 2, 1, 0, 0])**:\n  - Value = (1 x 71) + (2 x 1) + (1 x 27) + (0 x 99) + (0 x 78)\n  - Value = 71 + 2 + 27 = 100\n  - Adjusted Value = 100 x 0.9604 = 96.04 (after discounting)\n  \n  This is far below your outside offer of 431.\n\n- **Potential Counteroffers**:\n  Let's consider what you keep instead, and check it against your outside offer and the current offer.\n  - Suppose we keep [6, 3, 5, 2, 4] (offering [1, 2, 1, 0, 0]), which gives us:\n    - Value = (6 x 71) + (3 x 1) + (5 x 27) + (2 x 99) + (4 x 78)\n    - Value = 426 + 3 + 135 + 198 + 312 = 1074\n    - Adjusted Value = 1074 x 0.9604 = 1031.4576 (after discounting)\n  \n  Keeping [6, 3, 5, 2, 4] yields a significantly higher value than both the current offer and your outside offer, but let's avoid mistake 1 by proposing an offer better for Player 2 than what they offered.\n\n  Let's propose [4, 4, 3, 1, 2], to keep a reasonable share:\n  - Your kept items [3, 1, 3, 1, 2] give:\n    - Value = (3 x 71) + (1 x 1) + (3 x 27) + (1 x 99) + (2 x 78)\n    - Value = 213 + 1 + 81 + 99 + 156 = 550\n    - Adjusted Value = 550 x 0.9604 = 528.22 (after discounting)\n  \n  This is better for you than your outside offer.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision:\nGiven the analysis above, the current offer on the table is far below your outside offer at an adjusted value of 96.04. A counteroffer of keeping [3, 1, 3, 1, 2] (offering [4, 4, 3, 1, 2]) results in a much better value for you than your outside offer.\n\nTherefore, the best option is to counteroffer with a division that gives us higher value than the current offer and our outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 4, 3, 1, 2]}\n```",

Here's one potential division:\n    - Player 1: 2 units Item 1, 1 unit Item 2, 0 units Item 3, 1 unit Item 4, 3 units Item 5\n    - Player 2: 0 units Item 1, 2 units Item 2, 3 units Item 3, 1 unit Item 4, 2 units Item 5\n\n  Calculating my value from this counteroffer:\n  - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 74 = 148\n  - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 42 = 42\n  - 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 26 = 0\n  - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 47 = 47\n  - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117\n  \n  Total value = 148 + 42 + 0 + 47 + 117 = 354\n\n  This potential division gives me a value of 354, which is clearly better than my outside offer of 24.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\n- **Accept Current Offer:** Not applicable, there is no current offer.\n- **Walk Away:** Not advisable as my outside offer is lower than possible counteroffer values.\n- **Propose a Counteroffer:** Proposing a counteroffer that is considerably above 24 (my outside offer).\n\nBased on this analysis, I will make an initial counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 3, 1, 2]}",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 3, 2, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    15 x 0 + 16 x 3 + 80 x 3 + 59 x 2 + 40 x 5\n    which is 606 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 614. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 3, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 3, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

This means that offers in later rounds are slightly less valuable.\n\n2) **Assess the value of the current offer:**\n   - Current offer to me: [0, 2, 3, 1, 2]\n   - This means Player 1 is offering me 0 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n   - My value of this offer: (0 * 15) + (2 * 16) + (3 * 80) + (1 * 59) + (2 * 40) = 0 + 32 + 240 + 59 + 80 = 411\n\n3) **Compare to outside offer:**\n   - The current offer (411) is significantly less than my outside offer (614).\n\n4) **Consider potential counteroffers:**\n   - To prevent mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer, I need to ensure any counteroffer gives me a value of at least 614.\n\n5) **Develop a potential counteroffer:**\n    - I will start by trying to get all of item 3, a unit of item 4, and a unit of item 5.\n   - Let's try to offer Player 1: Item 1 = 2, Item 2 = 3, Item 3 = 0, Item 4 = 1, Item 5 = 4.

This still less than the outside offer, so this is not a great offer\n   - If I keep everything, my total value is 636.\n   - Let's offer Player 1 [2,3,0,0,0]. Then for me I have [0,0,3,2,5]. My valuation of that would be 0 * 15 + 0 * 16 + 3 * 80 + 2 * 59 + 5 * 40 = 0+0+240+118+200 = 558. Still too low!\n\n   - Let's try an offer that guarantees a better outcome than walking away: Item 1 = 0, Item 2 = 0, Item 3 = 0, Item 4 = 0, Item 5 = 0. If I get the rest, my valuation would be the maximum possible (636), and I will offer the player 1 the items I don't care about.\n\n6) **Decision:**\nSince the current offer is much worse than my outside offer, and the first round is still early enough to attempt to negotiate, I should make a counteroffer, offering player 1 nothing and getting all the value for myself.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 3, 2, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    15 x 0 + 16 x 3 + 80 x 3 + 59 x 2 + 40 x 5\n    which is 606 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 614. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 3, 1, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 3, 1, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 3, 1, 3]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 614.\n   - My values for the items are: item 1 = 15, item 2 = 16, item 3 = 80, item 4 = 59, item 5 = 40.\n   - The total pool of items is: 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor is 0.98. Since we are in round 2, accepting now means a value multiplied by 0.98^(2-1) = 0.98.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current Offer:** I am offered [0, 2, 3, 1, 3]. This means I keep:\n      - Item 1: 2 - 0 = 2 units\n      - Item 2: 3 - 2 = 1 unit\n      - Item 3: 3 - 3 = 0 units\n      - Item 4: 2 - 1 = 1 unit\n      - Item 5: 5 - 3 = 2 units\n\n      My value for this offer is: (2 * 15) + (1 * 16) + (0 * 80) + (1 * 59) + (2 * 40) = 30 + 16 + 0 + 59 + 80 = 185.\n      Discounted value: 185 * 0.98 = 181.3\n\n   - **Comparison to Outside Offer:** The current offer's discounted value (181.3) is significantly less than my outside offer (614). Therefore, accepting this offer would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\n\n   - **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to calculate potential counteroffers that would yield a value greater than my outside offer. Since the game ends after round 3, I should propose an offer that maximizes my value now, discounted by 0.98.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince accepting the current offer is worse than my outside offer, I should not accept.\n\nLet's consider some potential counteroffers. To ensure the counteroffer is better than my outside offer, let's try to keep most of item 3 and item 4:\nI'll try keeping all items 3 and 4, and item 5 for a start:\n\n*   Offer: [2, 3, 0, 0, 0] (Offer Player 1 all items 1, 2 and none of 3, 4 or 5)\n    *   My kept items: [0, 0, 3, 2, 5]\n    *   My value: (0 * 15) + (0 * 16) + (3 * 80) + (2 * 59) + (5 * 40) = 0 + 0 + 240 + 118 + 200 = 558.  558 * 0.98 = 546.84 (worse than outside offer)\n\n*   Offer: [2, 3, 0, 0, 1] (Offer Player 1 all items 1, 2, item 5 but none of 3, 4)\n    *   My kept items: [0, 0, 3, 2, 4]\n    *   My value: (0 * 15) + (0 * 16) + (3 * 80) + (2 * 59) + (4 * 40) = 0 + 0 + 240 + 118 + 160 = 518. 518 * 0.98 = 507.64\n\nLet's try keeping one unit of item 1 and one unit of item 2:\n*   Offer: [1, 2, 0, 0, 0] (Offer Player 1 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2)\n    *   My kept items: [1, 1, 3, 2, 5]\n    *   My value: (1 * 15) + (1 * 16) + (3 * 80) + (2 * 59) + (5 * 40) = 15 + 16 + 240 + 118 + 200 = 589.  589 * 0.98 = 577.22 (still worse)\n\nLet's try giving player 1 only 1 unit of item 1:\n*   Offer: [1, 3, 3, 2, 5]\n    *   My kept items: [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    *   My value: 1 * 15 = 15. Obviously not acceptable.\n\nLet's try keeping at least one of each valuable item:\n* Offer: [1, 3, 0, 1, 3] (Offer player 1 with 1 item 1, 3 item 2, 1 item 4, and 3 item 5)\n    * My kept items: [1, 0, 3, 1, 2]\n    * My Value: (1 * 15) + (0 * 16) + (3 * 80) + (1 * 59) + (2 * 40) = 15 + 0 + 240 + 59 + 80 = 394. 394 * 0.98 = 386.12\n\nIt seems very difficult to find an offer that's above my outside offer value. I will try something more extreme.\n\n* Offer: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    * My kept items: [2, 3, 3, 2, 5]\n    * My Value: (2 * 15) + (3 * 16) + (3 * 80) + (2 * 59) + (5 * 40) = 30 + 48 + 240 + 118 + 200 = 636. 636 * 0.98 = 623.28.\n    * This is above my outside offer value.\n\nSo, my action is to make a counteroffer of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 614\n*   My item values: item 1 = 15, item 2 = 16, item 3 = 80, item 4 = 59, item 5 = 40\n*   Total items: 2 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 5 of item 5\n*   Discount factor: 0.98.  Since we are in round 3, the discount factor is 0.98^(3-1) = 0.98^2 = 0.9604\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   Current offer: I am offered [0, 1, 1, 0, 1]. This means I get 0 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 0 of item 4, and 1 of item 5.\n    My value for the current offer: (0 * 15) + (1 * 16) + (1 * 80) + (0 * 59) + (1 * 40) = 0 + 16 + 80 + 0 + 40 = 136.\n    Applying the discount factor, the present value of accepting the current offer is 136 * 0.9604 = 130.6144.\n*   Comparison to outside offer: 130.6144 < 614. Accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider some potential counteroffers and their values. I need to keep enough items to exceed my outside offer value of 614.\n\n*   Counteroffer scenario 1: I offer Player 1 [2, 2, 2, 2, 4]. This means I keep [0, 1, 1, 0, 1]. My value is, as calculated above, 136.\n*   Counteroffer scenario 2: To get a value greater than 614, I need to keep more items. I need to leave less items to player 1.\n\nLet me consider offering very little to Player 1 to start.\nConsider offering Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\nThen I keep [2, 3, 3, 2, 5].\nMy value is (2 * 15) + (3 * 16) + (3 * 80) + (2 * 59) + (5 * 40) = 30 + 48 + 240 + 118 + 200 = 636. Applying discount factor, 636 * 0.9604 = 610.13.\n\nHowever, the other agent seems to want more than [0,0,0,0,0] based on the past offers, and it is the final round, so it might be better to improve the counteroffer to avoid walking away.\n\nI want to keep 614/0.9604 = 639.3169...\n\nI want to test the offer [0, 1, 1, 0, 1] that player 1 just proposed, but keep the rest for myself. If I accept this, my value is 136.\nValue of walking away is 614.\n\nConsider offer [0, 1, 1, 0, 1], which player 1 proposed.\nThen offer the same back. I keep the other items.\nValue of keeping 2 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 4 of item 5\n2*15 + 2*16 + 2*80 + 2*59 + 4*40 = 30+32+160+118+160 = 500.\nThis is still below my outside offer, even with the discount factor.\n\nIf I offer [0, 0, 1, 0, 1].\nThen I keep [2, 3, 2, 2, 4].\n2*15 + 3*16 + 2*80 + 2*59 + 4*40 = 30+48+160+118+160 = 516.\n\nI should improve my counteroffer, the highest value I can get is by offering [0,0,0,0,0], but this is still worse than the outside offer when considering the discount factor.\nI should walk away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "To determine the best action in this negotiation scenario, we first need to assess our situation and then plan our approach accordingly. Let's go through the questions step by step to get a clear understanding.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Situation\n\n- **Outside Offer Value:** Our outside offer is worth 98. This is the minimum value we want any deal to exceed to consider it worthwhile.\n\n- **Values of the Items:**\n  - Item 1: 61 per unit\n  - Item 2: 51 per unit\n  - Item 3: 35 per unit\n  - Item 4: 42 per unit\n  - Item 5: 23 per unit\n  \n- **Total Pool of Items:**\n  - 4 units of Item 1\n  - 7 units of Item 2\n  - 11 units of Item 3\n  - 3 units of Item 4\n  - 3 units of Item 5\n\n- **Discount Factor:** The discount rate gamma is 0.98, meaning with each delay in reaching an agreement, the value decreases slightly due to the time element.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\nSince no current offer is on the table, we need to consider what kind of opening offer we can make.\n\n**Potential Offer Assessments:**\n\nWe need our initial offer to be above our outside offer value of 98 so as not to make Mistakes 2 or 4. Additionally, we have to allocate items in a way that maximizes our retained value while providing a fair portion to Player 2 to ensure they might consider accepting or countering the offer instead of walking away.\n\nLet's calculate some example division offers and ensure our kept value exceeds 98.\n\n- **Offer Example 1: Giving away [2, 3, 6, 2, 2]**\n\n  - What's left for us: \n    - Item 1: 4 - 2 = 2 \u2192 2 * 61 = 122\n    - Item 2: 7 - 3 = 4 \u2192 4 * 51 = 204\n    - Item 3: 11 - 6 = 5 \u2192 5 * 35 = 175\n    - Item 4: 3 - 2 = 1 \u2192 1 * 42 = 42\n    - Item 5: 3 - 2 = 1 \u2192 1 * 23 = 23\n    \n  - Total value retained: 122 + 204 + 175 + 42 + 23 = 566\n\nThe total value of 566 is significantly above our outside offer value of 98, meaning this offer is safe in terms of outcome value compared to our fallback option.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\n- **Decision: Make an Initial Offer**\n\nGiven the strategic considerations, ensuring the offer guarantees a retained value better than the outside offer is critical and that it is reasonable enough not to jeopardize negotiation continuity.\n\n- **Offer:** [2, 3, 6, 2, 2]\n\nThis respects our objectives, avoids negotiation mistakes, and provides a reasonable starting point for Player 2 to respond or counter-offer without incentivizing an immediate walk.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 3, 6, 2, 2]}\n```",

This means that waiting for a future round reduces the value of any outcome by 2%.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [2, 3, 6, 2, 2]. This means Player 1 keeps 4-2=2 of item 1, 7-3=4 of item 2, 11-6=5 of item 3, 3-2=1 of item 4 and 3-2=1 of item 5.\n    So I get 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n    My value for accepting this offer is: (2 * 15) + (3 * 2) + (6 * 73) + (2 * 100) + (2 * 16) = 30 + 6 + 438 + 200 + 32 = 706\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** 706 < 839.

I would keep all of items 1, 2, and 5 for myself, and 0 units of item 3 and 4.\nOffer: [0, 0, 11, 3, 0]\nMy value = (4 * 15) + (7 * 2) + (0 * 73) + (0 * 100) + (3 * 16) = 60 + 14 + 0 + 0 + 48 = 122\nThis is too low, so I will try to create a different counteroffer.\n\nLet's try the offer [1, 2, 5, 1, 1]. This offer gives the other player a little of everything.\nThis means I keep 3 of item 1, 5 of item 2, 6 of item 3, 2 of item 4, and 2 of item 5.\nMy value is: (3 * 15) + (5 * 2) + (6 * 73) + (2 * 100) + (2 * 16) = 45 + 10 + 438 + 200 + 32 = 725\nThis is still less than 839.\n\nI will propose to give away some of item 1, some of item 2, and less of 3, 4 and 5 so that I have a value above my reservation.\nI will propose [1, 2, 3, 1, 1]. This means I have: 3 of item 1, 5 of item 2, 8 of item 3, 2 of item 4, and 2 of item 5.\nMy value is: 3*15 + 5*2 + 8*73 + 2*100 + 2*16 = 45 + 10 + 584 + 200 + 32 = 871\nThis is a valid counteroffer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer of [2, 3, 6, 2, 2] yields me a value of 706, which is less than my outside offer of 839. Therefore, I should not accept it. I will propose a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer and also gives Player 1 something reasonable.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 3, 1, 1]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    61 x 0 + 51 x 1 + 35 x 0 + 42 x 0 + 23 x 2\n    which is 97 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 98. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 3, 6, 2, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 2, 3, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 3, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Let\u2019s adjust to maximize my value while exceeding my fallback:\n\n   - Try keeping [0, 4, 1, 3, 3]:\n     - For item 1, I receive 0, value: 0\n     - For item 2, I receive 4, value: \\(4 \\times 20 = 80\\)\n     - For item 3, I receive 1, value: \\(1 \\times 28 = 28\\)\n     - For item 4, I receive 3, value: \\(3 \\times 39 = 117\\)\n     - For item 5, I receive 3, value: \\(3 \\times 50 = 150\\)\n\n     Total value = \\(0 + 80 + 28 + 117 + 150 = 375\\)\n\n   Given this analysis, all proposed divisions keep falling below my outside offer. It seems that Player 2 will need to make significant concessions or I'll need to shift items more significantly towards myself in subsequent rounds. \n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n   Since I'm not receiving a higher value than my outside offer with these allocations for items, I need to counter strategically:\n\nI should offer as much of item 3 and some portions of item 4 since those yield favorable outcomes minimally for me. Offering more units from which they might not highly value might work favorably.\n\nTherefore, I'll propose the best calculated offer: maintaining the prospects of continuing rounds where advantageous shifts can be made. Let's refine:\n\nI\u2019ll attempt: [0, 4, 1, 3, 4]:\n     - For item 1, I receive 0, value: 0\n     - For item 2, I receive 4, value: \\(4 \\times 20 = 80\\)\n     - For item 3, I receive 1, value: \\(1 \\times 28 = 28\\)\n     - For item 4, I receive 3, value: \\(3 \\times 39 = 117\\)\n     - For item 5, I receive 4, value: \\(4 \\times 50 = 200\\)\n\n     Total value = \\(0 + 80 + 28 + 117 + 200 = 425\\)\n\nThis proposed allocation is above the outside offer and ensures room for negotiation. \n\n**Action:**  \n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 200. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 537 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 1, 4, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    30 x 0 + 42 x 3 + 37 x 1 + 9 x 4 + 61 x 0\n    which is 199 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 200. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

This means accepting an offer in later rounds is slightly less valuable than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of the current offer:**\n   - The current offer is [0, 0, 1, 1, 1], meaning I receive 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 1 of item 5.\n   - My value for this offer is (0 * 30) + (0 * 42) + (1 * 37) + (1 * 9) + (1 * 61) = 0 + 0 + 37 + 9 + 61 = 107.\n   - This is less than my outside offer of 200.\n\n3) **Consider a counteroffer:**\nSince the current offer is below my outside offer, I will make a counteroffer. I need to figure out a division that gives me more than 200 value while leaving Player 1 with something valuable enough for them to consider accepting.\n\nI want to keep as much of items 2, 3, and 5 as possible, since they have the highest value for me. Item 4 has the lowest. Item 1 has no value.\n\nLet's start with an offer where I give Player 1 the minimum they might accept, and evaluate from there. Given Player 1's offer was 0,0,1,1,1. Let's reverse this and give them just a little bit more.\n\nI will offer Player 1 [0, 1, 1, 2, 2]. This means I keep [0, 3, 1, 2, 2].\n\nMy value would be:\n(0 * 30) + (3 * 42) + (1 * 37) + (2 * 9) + (2 * 61) = 0 + 126 + 37 + 18 + 122 = 303\n\nThis is much better than my outside offer.
