Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 284. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 405 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 4, 2, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    11 x 1 + 37 x 1 + 12 x 4 + 38 x 2 + 37 x 3\n    which is 283 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 284. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Assessing my position\n\nTotal possible value if I keep all items:\n- Item 1: 2 \u00d7 46 = 92\n- Item 2: 2 \u00d7 63 = 126\n- Item 3: 6 \u00d7 59 = 354\n- Item 4: 6 \u00d7 32 = 192\n- Item 5: 5 \u00d7 35 = 175\n- Total: 939\n\nMy outside offer (696) is about 74% of the total possible value (939).\n\n## 3. Formulating a counteroffer\n\nI need to offer Player 2 something while keeping items worth at least 696 for myself. Let me try different allocations:\n\nLet's try keeping the most valuable items for me:\n- Keep all of item 2 (126 value)\n- Keep all of item 3 (354 value)\n- Keep 1 unit of item 1 (46 value)\n- Keep 4 units of item 4 (128 value)\n- Keep 2 units of item 5 (70 value)\n\nTotal value for me: 126 + 354 + 46 + 128 + 70 = 724 > 696 (my outside offer)\n\nThis means I would offer Player 2:\n- 1 unit of item 1\n- 0 units of item 2\n- 0 units of item 3\n- 2 units of item 4\n- 3 units of item 5\n\nThis is a reasonable starting offer that keeps my value above my outside offer while giving Player 2 some items.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 556. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 903 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Instead, I should propose a counteroffer that aims to maximize my payoff, focusing on items that contribute most to my total value:\n\n**Counteroffer Proposal**:\n- Offer fewer items 4 and 5 to Player 1. \n- Aim to retain more commodities beneficial to me given my item value.\n\nCounteroffer: [1, 0, 6, 1, 2]. \n\nCalculating:\n- 1 unit of item 1: 1 \u00d7 51 = 51\n- 0 unit of item 2: 0 \u00d7 68 = 0\n- 6 units of item 3: 6 \u00d7 3 = 18\n- 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 89 = 89\n- 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 90 = 180\n\nTotal Value of Counteroffer to Me: 51 + 0 + 18 + 89 + 180 = 338.\n\nI realize from the computation that even with adjustments, staying closer to utilizing items 4 and 5 gives me a better negotiation position. Aiming for a 3 unit possession of item 5 would provide a more advantageous counter.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 535. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 732 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 3, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 3, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Accepting the current offer would be a mistake (Mistake 4) because it is worse than my outside offer.\n\nSince the current offer is not acceptable, I should make a counteroffer that tries to secure a total value greater than or equal to my outside offer. Let's propose a counteroffer where I try to maximize the value while still leaving room for Player 1 to have some items:\n\n### Counteroffer Calculation\nI'll aim to make a counteroffer that gives me a value close to my outside offer.\n\nLet\u2019s suggest:\n- I keep both units of item 2 because they are highly valued to me.\n- I keep 4 units of item 4 for a substantial value.\n- I keep all of item 5, which is still valuable to me.\n\nSo, my counteroffer where I give the minimum possible to Player 1 could be:\n- Give Player 1: 2 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5.\n\nCalculate the new total value for myself:\n- 0 units of item 1: 0 \u00d7 26 = 0\n- 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 84 = 168\n- 3 units of item 3: 3 \u00d7 15 = 45\n- 4 units of item 4: 4 \u00d7 56 = 224\n- 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 63 = 126\n- **Total Value:** 0 + 168 + 45 + 224 + 126 = 563\n\nThis total is greater than my outside offer value of 535, so it makes sense to propose this counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 1, 2, 0]}\n```",

Your value would be:\n    38 x 1 + 41 x 2 + 30 x 2 + 91 x 2 + 25 x 1\n    which is 387 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 388. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation**:\n\n   - **Outside offer value**: My outside offer is 535.\n   - **Values of the items**: \n     - Item 1 value: 26 per unit\n     - Item 2 value: 84 per unit\n     - Item 3 value: 15 per unit\n     - Item 4 value: 56 per unit\n     - Item 5 value: 63 per unit\n   - **Total pool of items**: \n     - 2 units of item 1\n     - 2 units of item 2\n     - 4 units of item 3\n     - 6 units of item 4\n     - 2 units of item 5\n   - **Discount factor**: With a discount rate gamma of 0.98, offers in subsequent rounds are slightly less valuable.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers**:\n\n   - **Current offer** to me ([1, 1, 3, 1, 1]):\n     - Value of 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 26 = 26\n     - Value of 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 84 = 84\n     - Value of 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45\n     - Value of 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 56 = 56\n     - Value of 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 63 = 63\n     - Total = 26 + 84 + 45 + 56 + 63 = 274\n   - **Compare with outside offer**: The current offer value (274) is much lower than my outside offer value (535).\n\n3) **Decision**:\n\n   Based on the above analysis:\n   - Accepting the current offer (274) is not beneficial as it is worse than my outside offer (535).\n   - Walking away would give me 535, which is better than the current offer.\n   - Proposing a counteroffer that provides me with at least 535 in value, considering the discount factor for the next round, is ideal. \n\nLet's propose a counteroffer. My goal is to propose an offer that would provide me a value higher than my outside offer or at least very close to it. However, given that the negotiation will conclude if it reaches round 3 with no agreement, let\u2019s ensure our offer avoids being worse off than accepting the outside offer. \n\nI want to keep a higher portion of high-value items for myself. So, I will give player 1 less of the higher-value items from my perspective:\n\nLet's counteroffer with [1, 0, 2, 3, 0] for Player 1:\n- Value to me:\n  - 1 unit of item 1 to Player 1; I keep 1 unit = 1 \u00d7 26 = 26\n  - 0 units of item 2 to Player 1; I keep 2 units = 2 \u00d7 84 = 168\n  - 2 units of item 3 to Player 1; I keep 2 units = 2 \u00d7 15 = 30\n  - 3 units of item 4 to Player 1; I keep 3 units = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168\n  - 0 units of item 5 to Player 1; I keep 2 units = 2 \u00d7 63 = 126\n- Total value to me in this counteroffer = 26 + 168 + 30 + 168 + 126 = 518\n\nThis counteroffer\u2019s value (518) is still below my outside offer (535) but is closer to it. In round 2, this could leverage a balanced resolution necessary for both players to consider fair. It shows a willingness to negotiate, increasing the likelihood of reaching a mutually agreeable solution without conceding too much value. However, to push this equilibrium toward agreement, an assertive strategic posture with slightly less than required units may coerce an improved counter by Player 1.\n\nHere's my action:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 2, 3, 0]}",

                    "prompt": "\n    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\n    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\n    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\n    There are 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\n    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\n    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 101.\n    Your private values are 38 for item 1, 41 for item 2, 30 for item 3, 91 for item 4, 25 for item 5.\n    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to your total value of all items, which is 874. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 388. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 388. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 675 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    38 x 1 + 41 x 2 + 30 x 2 + 91 x 2 + 25 x 1\n    which is 387 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 388. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 3, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 0, 1, 2, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 3, 1, 1]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 2, 3, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 2, 3, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 301. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 438 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 1, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 1, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "To determine the best course of action, let's walk through the analysis step by step:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n   - **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer is valued at 301.\n   - **Values of the Items:**\n     - Item 1: 43 per unit\n     - Item 2: 15 per unit\n     - Item 3: 61 per unit\n     - Item 4: 6 per unit\n     - Item 5: 21 per unit\n   - **Total Pool of Items:**\n     - 2 units of item 1\n     - 2 units of item 2\n     - 5 units of item 3\n     - 3 units of item 4\n     - 4 units of item 5\n   - **Discount Factor:** The discount factor (gamma) is 0.98. This means each round of delay decreases the present value of any potential agreement. However, since this is round 1, the discount factor does not affect the total value yet.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current Offer:** [0, 1, 1, 1, 2] (the items being offered to me)\n     - Value of item 1: 0 \u00d7 43 = 0\n     - Value of item 2: 1 \u00d7 15 = 15\n     - Value of item 3: 1 \u00d7 61 = 61\n     - Value of item 4: 1 \u00d7 6 = 6\n     - Value of item 5: 2 \u00d7 21 = 42\n     - Total value = 0 + 15 + 61 + 6 + 42 = 124\n\n   The current offer gives me a total value of 124, which is significantly less than my outside offer of 301. Thus, accepting this offer would result in a worse outcome than my outside offer.\n\n   - **Potential Counteroffers:**\n     - To avoid Mistakes, especially Mistake 2 (making an offer worse than my outside offer), I need to ensure that any items I keep result in a total value greater than 301.\n\n       For example, a possible counteroffer could be to offer items that ensure my total value exceeds 301. Due to limited rounds, it's crucial the offer made also appears reasonable to Player 1, so they consider accepting it.\n\n3) **Decision Making:**\n\nSince accepting the current offer provides a total value of 124, which is less than the outside offer value of 301, accepting is not an option. Walking away will still secure me my outside offer value. Therefore, it's in my interest to issue a counteroffer that beats my outside offer while remaining attractive to Player 1.\n\nTo maximize my outcome, I should aim to keep units with the highest individual value first:\n\n   - Consider a counteroffer to keep:\n     - 2 units of item 1 (2 \u00d7 43 = 86)\n     - 1 unit of item 3 (1 \u00d7 61 = 61)\n     - 1 unit of item 2 (1 \u00d7 15 = 15)\n     - 1 unit of item 4 (1 \u00d7 6 = 6)\n     - 2 units of item 5 (2 \u00d7 21 = 42)\n   \n   Total value = 86 + 61 + 15 + 6 + 42 = 210 (< my outside offer of 301).\n\n   I will adjust to aim for a better outcome, trying to construct my share valuation near or above 301 while keeping potential acceptance by Player 1:\n\nCounteroffer proposal, if I consider keeping:\n   - 2 units of item 1       = 86\n   - 0 unit of item 2        = 0\n   - 4 units of item 3     = 244\n   - 0 unit of item 4        = 0\n   - 2 units of item 5     = 42\n   \n   Total recalculative = 372 (> my outside offer of 301).\n\nOffer to Player 1:\n   - 0 Item 1, 2 Item 2, 1 Item 3, 3 Item 4, 2 Item 5\n\nMy proposed counteroffer breakdown for fair consideration:\n   - Item 1 -> 0 unit\n   - Item 2 -> 2 units\n   - Item 3 -> 1 unit\n   - Item 4 -> 3 units\n   - Item 5 -> 2 units \n\nThus, the counteroffer for Player 1 will be [0, 2, 1, 3, 2].

This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 5, 1, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    93 x 1 + 81 x 0 + 92 x 5 + 72 x 1 + 41 x 4\n    which is 789 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 790. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

In round 2, the discount factor is 0.98^(2-1) = 0.98.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer: [0, 1, 1, 2, 1]\n     - Value to me:\n       - Item 1: 0 \u00d7 43 = 0\n       - Item 2: 1 \u00d7 15 = 15\n       - Item 3: 1 \u00d7 61 = 61\n       - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 6 = 12\n       - Item 5: 1 \u00d7 21 = 21\n     - Total value = 15 + 61 + 12 + 21 = 109\n     - Adjusted for discount: 109 \u00d7 0.98 = 106.82\n\n   - My outside offer is 301, which is greater than the value of the current offer after discounting (106.82).\n\n3) Make a decision:\n   - Accepting the current offer would give me a value of less than my outside offer (106.82 vs 301).\n   - Walking away guarantees me 301.\n   - Counteroffer needs to give me a value higher than 301 after discounting.\n\nI must ensure the counteroffer provides a greater value than my outside offer of 301 after applying the discount. One way to achieve this is to propose keeping items that maximize my private value.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 790. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1137 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 5, 1, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    93 x 1 + 81 x 0 + 92 x 5 + 72 x 1 + 41 x 4\n    which is 789 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 790. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 1, 1, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 2, 1, 3, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 1, 2, 1]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 496. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 849 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 1, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 1, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Let's step through the analysis as outlined:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n1. **My Outside Offer Value:**\n   - My outside offer value is 496.\n\n2. **Values of the Items Involved:**\n   - Item 1: Value per unit = 32\n   - Item 2: Value per unit = 69\n   - Item 3: Value per unit = 62\n   - Item 4: Value per unit = 31\n   - Item 5: Value per unit = 89\n\n3. **Total Pool of Items:**\n   - Item 1: 2 units\n   - Item 2: 5 units\n   - Item 3: 2 units\n   - Item 4: 4 units\n   - Item 5: 3 units\n\n4. **Effect of the Discount Factor:**\n   - The discount factor is 0.98, which means the longer we negotiate, the less valuable the outcome becomes in present value terms.\n   - Since it's round 1, the discount factor does not currently diminish the value for this round, but it could impact future rounds if negotiations continue.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n1. **Current Offer from Player 1: [0, 1, 1, 1, 2]**\n   - Item 1: 0 units = 0\n   - Item 2: 1 unit = 1 \u00d7 69 = 69\n   - Item 3: 1 unit = 1 \u00d7 62 = 62\n   - Item 4: 1 unit = 1 \u00d7 31 = 31\n   - Item 5: 2 units = 2 \u00d7 89 = 178\n   - Total Value of Current Offer = 69 + 62 + 31 + 178 = 340\n\n2. **Comparison to Outside Offer:**\n   - The value of accepting the current offer (340) is less than my outside offer (496).\n\n3. **Assessing Potential Counteroffers:**\n   - I need to ensure any counteroffer is worth more than 496 to me. \n   - Some examples to consider:\n     - [1, 2, 1, 2, 1] would give me: \n       - Item 1: 1 \u00d7 32 = 32 \n       - Item 2: 3 \u00d7 69 = 207\n       - Item 3: 1 \u00d7 62 = 62\n       - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 31 = 62\n       - Item 5: 2 \u00d7 89 = 89\n     - Total value for this counteroffer would be 552.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\n1. **Should I Accept the Current Offer?**\n   - No, because 340 < 496.\n\n2. **Should I Walk Away?**\n   - Not unless I can't create a counteroffer where I receive more than 496 value.\n\n3. **Counteroffer:**\n   - To avoid Mistake 2, I propose to counteroffer a division that ensures my total value is at least as high as my outside offer. Based on my analysis, offering Player 1 [1, 2, 1, 2, 1] maximizes my remaining value above my outside offer.\n\nThe counteroffer would be:\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 1, 2, 1]}",

I should be willing to give up more of the lower value items (items 2 and 3).\n\nLet me formulate an initial offer where I keep most of my high-value items and offer some of my lower-value items:\n\n**Potential offer 1**: Give [1, 3, 2, 0, 1] to Player 2, keeping [2, 1, 1, 1, 2] for myself.\n\nMy value calculation if this offer is accepted:\n- 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 67 = 134\n- 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 27 = 27\n- 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 34 = 34\n- 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 50 = 50\n- 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 72 = 144\n- Total value = 389\n\nThis is well above my outside offer of 185, so this would be a good deal for me.\n\n## Step 3: Make a decision\n\nSince this is the first round, I need to make a strategic offer. The offer [1, 3, 2, 0, 1] gives me 389 in value, which is more than double my outside offer of 185. This seems like a good starting point for negotiation.\n\nI'm keeping more of the items I value most (items 1 and 5) while offering more of the items I value less (items 2 and 3). I'm keeping the single unit of item 4 since it has moderate value to me.\n\nThis offer:\n- Is much better than my outside offer value (389 > 185)\n- Distributes items reasonably to both parties\n- Preserves my highest-value items\n- Gives Player 2 a substantial portion of the items to consider\n\nLet me proceed with this counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 3, 2, 0, 1]}",

If we conclude in round 1, there is no reduction in value. If we get to subsequent rounds, the value will be adjusted (reduced) by the discount factor.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer ([1, 3, 2, 0, 1]) value calculation:**\n     - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 3 = 3\n     - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 64 = 192\n     - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 20 = 40\n     - 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 70 = 0\n     - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 24 = 24\n     - Total value = 3 + 192 + 40 + 0 + 24 = 259\n   - Compared to my outside offer value of 452, the current offer provides a much lower value. Accepting it would lead to Mistake 4, as I would accept an offer worse than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n   - The current offer is significantly worse than my outside offer, so I should not accept it.\n   - Since making a counteroffer is a better strategy than walking (which is irreversible and terminates the negotiation without exploring better possible outcomes), I should propose a counteroffer.\n   \n   I want a deal that gives me at least 452 in value or perhaps slightly below if I expect Player 1 might not accept a perfect split. Let's consider a division like giving them more of the lower-value items to reach our minimum acceptable threshold after accounting for next rounds\u2019 discount.\n\n   **Proposed counteroffer:**\n   - Give Player 1 the minimum valued items:\n     - Keep 0 items of item 1 (giving them 3)\n     - Keep 0 items of item 2 (giving them 4)\n     - Keep 1 item of item 3 (giving them 2)\n     - Keep 1 item of item 4 (giving them 0)\n     - Keep 1 item of item 5 (giving them 2)\n\n   **My value calculation for this counteroffer:**\n   - 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 3 = 0\n   - 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 64 = 0\n   - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 20 = 20\n   - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 70 = 70\n   - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 24 = 24\n   - Total value to me = 20 + 70 + 24 = 114\n   \n   Realizing this still not satisfactory, aim is to hold better deal through next rounds counteroffers which would increment by offering more eventually through evaluating against rounds reduction.\n   \n   **Thus, my action will be:**\n\n   ```json\n   {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 2, 2, 0, 2]}\n   ```",

Your value would be:\n    67 x 2 + 27 x 0 + 34 x 0 + 50 x 1 + 72 x 0\n    which is 184 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 185. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 2, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 2, 2, 0, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 3, 2, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 3, 2, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "To determine my next action, I'll evaluate the situation step-by-step:\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 452.\n   - My values for each item are: item 1: 3, item 2: 64, item 3: 20, item 4: 70, item 5: 24.\n   - The total pool of items is: 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor is 0.98, meaning that future offers will be slightly devalued compared to immediate ones.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer [0, 3, 2, 0, 1]:\n     - Value from item 2: 3 \u00d7 64 = 192\n     - Value from item 3: 2 \u00d7 20 = 40\n     - Value from item 5: 1 \u00d7 24 = 24\n     - Total value = 192 + 40 + 24 = 256\n\n   - Compare to my outside offer value (452): The current offer is significantly below my outside offer value.\n\n3) Make a decision:\n   - Accepting the current offer would give me a value of 256, which is worse than my outside offer of 452. It would be a mistake to accept.\n   - Walking away guarantees me a value of 452.\n   - Proposing a counteroffer requires ensuring it's better for me than the current offer and my outside offer.\n\nGiven that we are in round 2, I will attempt to maximize my gain by making a counteroffer that improves my payoff without crossing my outside offer value.\n\nProposed counteroffer:\n- I'll offer Player 1:\n  - 1 unit of item 1, keeping 2 units for myself, since it's of low value to me.\n  - 2 units of item 2, keeping 2 units for myself, as this is one of my most valuable items.\n  - 1 unit of item 3, keeping 2 units for myself.\n  - 0 units of item 4, keeping 1 unit for myself since it is my most valuable item.\n  - 1 unit of item 5, keeping 2 units for myself.\n\nCounteroffer [1, 2, 1, 0, 1] would leave me with:\n- 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 3 = 6\n- 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 64 = 128\n- 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 20 = 40\n- 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 70 = 70\n- 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 24 = 48\n- Total = 6 + 128 + 40 + 70 + 48 = 292\n\nChecking with the discount factor (round 2, r-1 = 1): 292 * 0.98 = 286.16, which is still below my outside offer of 452. However, making a counteroffer can potentially lead to a better outcome in the final round if Player 1 adjusts their offer.\n\nGiven these calculations and strategy, I propose the following counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 1, 0, 1]}",

Item 3: 18 per unit (lowest)\n\n### 3) Developing a Strategic Offer:\nI should keep my highest-value items and offer more of my lower-value items. Since this is the first offer, I should aim for a strong position while still making a somewhat fair offer.\n\nLet me try keeping:\n- 4 units of item 1 (keeping most of a medium-value item)\n- 2 units of item 2 (keeping most of a lower-value item)\n- 1 unit of item 3 (splitting the lowest-value item)\n- 2 units of item 4 (keeping most of a higher-value item)\n- 2 units of item 5 (keeping most of my highest-value item)\n\nThis means offering:\n- 2 units of item 1\n- 1 unit of item 2\n- 1 unit of item 3\n- 1 unit of item 4\n- 1 unit of item 5\n\nCalculating my value:\n- 4 \u00d7 40 = 160 (item 1)\n- 2 \u00d7 25 = 50 (item 2)\n- 1 \u00d7 18 = 18 (item 3)\n- 2 \u00d7 45 = 90 (item 4)\n- 2 \u00d7 62 = 124 (item 5)\n- Total: 442\n\nThis would be better than my outside offer of 383.\n\n### 4) Decision Making:\nThe offer I'm considering gives me a value of 442, which is 59 points better than my outside offer. It also gives something to the other player in each category, which is a reasonable starting point.\n\nI need to ensure I'm not making any of the five mistakes:\n- Not making a worse offer than previous (N/A - first offer)\n- Not making an offer worse for me than my outside offer (442 > 383 \u2713)\n- Not offering nothing or everything (offering some of each item \u2713)\n- Not accepting an offer worse than my outside offer (N/A)\n- Not walking away from an offer better than my outside offer (N/A)\n\nThis seems like a reasonable initial offer that gives me a good value while still giving the other player something to work with.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 1, 1, 1]}",

Your value would be:\n    40 x 0 + 25 x 1 + 18 x 2 + 45 x 3 + 62 x 3\n    which is 382 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 383. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

I need to ensure my offer is better than my outside option (113).\n\nI should keep the items I value most (especially items 4 and 5 with highest per-unit values) and offer the other player items I value less.\n\nLet me try different combinations to find a good offer:\n\nPotential offer 1: I keep [3, 5, 1, 1, 1] and offer [2, 3, 1, 0, 0]\nMy value: (3\u00d715) + (5\u00d732) + (1\u00d730) + (1\u00d764) + (1\u00d790) = 45 + 160 + 30 + 64 + 90 = 389\nThis is significantly better than my outside offer of 113.\n\nPotential offer 2: I keep [4, 6, 1, 1, 1] and offer [1, 2, 1, 0, 0]\nMy value: (4\u00d715) + (6\u00d732) + (1\u00d730) + (1\u00d764) + (1\u00d790) = 60 + 192 + 30 + 64 + 90 = 436\nThis is even better for me.\n\nLet me try an even more aggressive offer:\nPotential offer 3: I keep [4, 7, 2, 1, 1] and offer [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  \nMy value: (4\u00d715) + (7\u00d732) + (2\u00d730) + (1\u00d764) + (1\u00d790) = 60 + 224 + 60 + 64 + 90 = 498\nThis is much better for me but may be too aggressive.\n\n## 3) Decision Making\n\nSince this is the first round, I should propose a reasonable offer that leaves some room for negotiation but still gives me good value. I'll go with something between offers 1 and 2:\n\nMy counteroffer: [1, 2, 1, 0, 0] - giving Player 2 one unit of item 1, two units of item 2, and one unit of item 3, while keeping all units of items 4 and 5 for myself.\n\nThis means I keep [4, 6, 1, 1, 1], which gives me a value of 436.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

Since it's round 1, this has no immediate effect, but it's crucial for future considerations.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer (What I Receive)**: [1, 2, 1, 0, 0]\n  - Value Calculation:\n    - 1 unit of Item 1: 1 \u00d7 22 = 22\n    - 2 units of Item 2: 2 \u00d7 65 = 130\n    - 1 unit of Item 3: 1 \u00d7 21 = 21\n    - 0 units of Item 4: 0 \u00d7 3 = 0\n    - 0 units of Item 5: 0 \u00d7 93 = 0  \n    Total Value if Accepted = 22 + 130 + 21 = 173\n\n- **Comparison with Outside Offer**:\n  - My outside offer is worth 354 which is higher than the value I would receive (173) if I accept this current offer.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\n- **Should I Accept the Current Offer?**\n  - No, because 173 is less than my outside offer of 354.\n\n- **Should I Walk Away?**\n  - Not yet, because I have the opportunity to negotiate and potentially increase the value I'm getting.\n\n- **Counteroffer Proposal**:\n  - I need to ensure that my counteroffer yields more than 354 in value to make it worthwhile and to avoid mistakes such as Mistake 2 and Mistake 4.\n  - Let's make a strategic offer that aims to increase my share, especially focusing on high-value items like Item 2 and Item 5, but still leaving some room for Player 1 to be potentially interested.\n  \n  **Proposal Analysis for a Counteroffer**:\n  - Let's consider giving Player 1 the following: [3, 4, 1, 0, 0]\n  - This leaves me with: [2, 4, 1, 1, 1]\n\n  **Value of My Proposal**:\n  - 2 units of Item 1 = 2 \u00d7 22 = 44\n  - 4 units of Item 2 = 4 \u00d7 65 = 260\n  - 1 unit of Item 3 = 1 \u00d7 21 = 21\n  - 1 unit of Item 4 = 1 \u00d7 3 = 3\n  - 1 unit of Item 5 = 1 \u00d7 93 = 93  \n  Total Value = 44 + 260 + 21 + 3 + 93 = 421\n\n  - Since 421 > 354, this is a valid counteroffer ensuring I am not making Mistake 2.\n\nTherefore, my action is to make a counteroffer as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 4, 1, 0, 0]}\n```",

For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 0, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    15 x 1 + 32 x 1 + 30 x 0 + 64 x 1 + 90 x 0\n    which is 111 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 113. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 354. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 612 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 4, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 4, 1, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 4, 1, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To make a decision, let's go through the step-by-step analysis.\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 354.\n   - My private values per unit are: \n     - Item 1: 22\n     - Item 2: 65\n     - Item 3: 21\n     - Item 4: 3\n     - Item 5: 93\n   - The total pool of items is:\n     - 5 units of item 1\n     - 8 units of item 2\n     - 2 units of item 3\n     - 1 unit of item 4\n     - 1 unit of item 5\n   - The discount factor influences the value of accepting the current offer, as waiting for more rounds will reduce the value of future outcomes by the discount factor gamma of 0.98.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer [2, 4, 1, 0, 0] gives me:\n     - 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 22 = 44\n     - 4 units of item 2: 4 \u00d7 65 = 260\n     - 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 21 = 21\n     - 0 units of item 4: 0 \u00d7 3 = 0\n     - 0 units of item 5: 0 \u00d7 93 = 0\n     - Total value = 44 + 260 + 21 = 325\n     - Adjusted for round 2 discount: 325 \u00d7 (0.98) = 318.5\n\n   - Compare to my outside offer value of 354, it's clear that this offer of adjusted value 318.5 is less than my outside offer.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - The current offer is worse for me than my outside offer, so I should not accept it.\n   - Walking away would give me 354, but I should consider proposing a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer or at least higher than the previous Player 1's and my last offers.\n   - My previous counteroffer to Player 1 was [3, 4, 1, 0, 0]. Let's improve upon it but remain attractive for acceptance by Player 1.\n\n   Propose a new counteroffer:\n   - Offer Player 1 the following:\n     - 2 units of item 1\n     - 5 units of item 2\n     - 0 units of item 3\n     - 1 unit of item 4\n     - 1 unit of item 5\n   - This translates to me keeping:\n     - 3 units of item 1\n     - 3 units of item 2\n     - 2 units of item 3\n     - 0 units of item 4\n     - 0 units of item 5\n\n   Calculate the value to me for this division:\n   - 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 22 = 66\n   - 3 units of item 2: 3 \u00d7 65 = 195\n   - 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 21 = 42\n   - 0 units of item 4: 0 \u00d7 3 = 0\n   - 0 units of item 5: 0 \u00d7 93 = 0\n   - Total value = 66 + 195 + 42 = 303\n   - Adjusted value for round 2 = 303 \u00d7 (0.98) = 296.94, which is still less than my outside offer.\n\nGiven walking away is better than the counteroffer adjustments, I'll propose one better suited than my previous keeping:\n\n   Proposed counteroffer to Player 1: [2, 6, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCalculate again for this counteroffer:\n- This translates to me keeping:\n  - 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 22 = 66\n  - 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 65 = 130\n  - 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 21 = 21\n  - 0 units of item 4: 0 \u00d7 3 = 0\n  - 0 units of item 5: 0 \u00d7 93 = 0\n  - Total value = 66 + 130 + 21 = 217\n  - Adjusted value for round 2 = 217 \u00d7 (0.98) = 212.66\n  \nConsidering these calculations, I recognize that no counteroffer will meet the outside fallback of 354, preferring subsequent adaptation.\n\nTherefore, my final decision:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Your value would be:\n    19 x 1 + 60 x 0 + 82 x 0 + 8 x 0 + 43 x 3\n    which is 148 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 149. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 1, 3, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    89 x 1 + 28 x 0 + 1 x 1 + 79 x 3 + 10 x 1\n    which is 337 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 338. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

This means if I accept in the next round (round 2), the value would be multiplied by 0.98.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the value of offers\n- **Current offer to me:** [1, 0, 4, 1, 1]\n  - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 35 = 35\n  - 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 42 = 0\n  - 4 units of item 3 = 4 \u00d7 56 = 224\n  - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 42 = 42\n  - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 56 = 56\n  - **Total current value to me:** 35 + 0 + 224 + 42 + 56 = 357\n\nComparing 357 to my outside offer value of 654, the current offer is significantly lower than my outside offer.\n\n- **Potential strategy for counteroffers:**\n  - I need to propose a division that gives me a value greater than 654. I will aim to create a counteroffer where I retain items that maximize my total value.\n\n  Example counteroffer: [2, 0, 0, 0, 0] (keeping 4 of item 1, all others balanced to give Player 1 more than their current offer)\n  - My value for keeping 4 of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 35 = 140\n  - My value for keeping 1 of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 42 = 42\n  - My value for keeping 0 of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 56 = 0\n  - My value for keeping 2 of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 42 = 84\n  - My value for keeping 1 of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 56 = 56\n  - **Total counteroffer value to me:** 140 + 42 + 0 + 84 + 56 = 322\n\nMy initial thought was to propose a counteroffer with a high value, but even a balanced approach doesn't lead to a value exceeding 654, emphasizing the strong value of my fallback offer heavily. Given that 654 significantly outweighs any immediately possible configuration I can conjure in this round context, an efficient approach is to walk.\n\n### Step 3: Make a decision based on analysis\n\n1. The current offer is 357, which is less than my outside offer of 654.\n2. A counteroffer with balanced divisions struggles to meet or exceed my outside offer.\n3. Walking away gives me the guaranteed 654, which is valued higher than the played conditions here.\n\nWith these considerations, it is most prudent to walk away, ensuring I meet the strong alternative safeguarding my negotiation value.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 2, 2, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    91 x 1 + 41 x 0 + 48 x 2 + 12 x 2 + 44 x 1\n    which is 255 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 258. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

It's slightly less than what I would get with my initial offer (553), but the difference is relatively small. If I try to negotiate further, we'll face additional discounting in the next round.\n\nI could propose a counteroffer that improves my position slightly, perhaps asking for 2 units of item 5 instead of 1, which would give me an additional 44 value. A reasonable counteroffer would be [3, 1, 1, 1, 2], which would give me 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 2 units of item 5, with a total value of 553.\n\nHowever, considering the discount factor and the already good deal on the table, accepting now might be more prudent. If I counteroffer and we reach round 3, the discount would reduce my potential value.\n\nGiven that the current offer is substantially above my outside offer, and the risks of further negotiation with discounting, I'll accept the current offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items.

This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 3, 4, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    17 x 0 + 30 x 1 + 14 x 3 + 63 x 4 + 43 x 1\n    which is 367 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 368. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 3, 4, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    17 x 0 + 30 x 1 + 14 x 3 + 63 x 4 + 43 x 1\n    which is 367 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 368. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 799. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 657 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

As we're in round 1, any deal accepted will not be discounted, but if we move to subsequent rounds, the value of a deal will be multiplied by 0.98^(r-1).\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n\n   - Current offer: [0, 5, 3, 0, 2]\n     - My value for this offer:\n       - 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 14 = 0\n       - 5 units of item 2 = 5 \u00d7 76 = 380\n       - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99\n       - 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 63 = 0\n       - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 33 = 66\n     - Total value if I accept = 380 + 99 + 66 = 545\n\n   - Comparison to outside offer:\n     - The current offer gives me a value of 545, which is less than my outside offer value of 799.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n\n   - The current offer of 545 is significantly lower than my outside offer of 799.\n   - Accepting this current offer would be a mistake, as it provides less value than my guaranteed fallback (Mistake 4).\n   - Walking away would secure my outside offer value of 799.\n   - I should not make a counteroffer that is worse than my outside offer. However, a counteroffer that improves my value above 799 could be considered.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most reasonable action is to propose a specific counteroffer to maximize my value while not exceeding my current outside value.\n\nLet's propose a counteroffer where I aim for a higher value:\n\n   - Give Player 1: [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n   - My counteroffer ensure that I would keep items adding up to a value above my outside offer:\n\n     Total obtained = 3*14 + 6*76 + 3*33 + 2*63 + 3*33\n    = 42 + 456 + 99 + 126 + 99 = 822\n\nThis offer would maximize my current value but would not fully take advantage of the whole item pool available.

Your value would be:\n    94 x 0 + 18 x 2 + 17 x 1 + 92 x 0 + 50 x 3\n    which is 203 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 204. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

The current offer value (441) is substantially lower than my outside offer value (799).\n\n3) **Make a decision**:\n   - Accepting the current offer is not viable as it's worth less than my outside offer.\n   - Walking away from this offer is a consideration but let's explore potential counteroffers before deciding to walk.\n   - Given the high value of my outside offer, I must ensure any counteroffer is worth close to 799 for my action to be rational. I will attempt to create a more favorable offer for myself while not making the mistake of offering all or no items.\n\n   Let's propose a counteroffer where I get a higher value than offered and check if it's feasible or better for me:\n\n   - Proposed counteroffer to Player 1: [0, 1, 0, 2, 0]\n     - This means I'm keeping the following: \n       - 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 14 = 56\n       - 5 units of item 2 = 5 \u00d7 76 = 380\n       - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99\n       - 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 63 = 0\n       - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99\n       - Total value = 56 + 380 + 99 + 0 + 99 = 634\n     - Adjusted value considering discount = 634 \u00d7 0.98 = 621.32\n     - This is still less than my outside offer, and better than telling them to take all of item 3.\n\nIn conclusion, given the significant gap between even favorable counteroffers and my high outside offer, the optimal action is to walk away from the negotiation and take the outside offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 27. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1110 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    87 x 0 + 87 x 0 + 78 x 0 + 68 x 0 + 50 x 0\n    which is 0 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 27. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 27. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1110 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    87 x 0 + 87 x 0 + 78 x 0 + 68 x 0 + 50 x 0\n    which is 0 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 27. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 3, 5]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 0, 2, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 0, 2, 4]\n\n    What is your action?

There's also a risk in making a counteroffer as we'd move to round 3 and face further discounting.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

I should either walk away or propose a counteroffer that gives me a higher value than 278, factoring in the discount rate.\n\n#### Potential Counteroffer Strategy\nTo not make Mistake 2 (offering less value than my outside offer), and avoiding Mistake 4 (accepting less than my fallback), I should propose a division that provides value greater than 278. Let's calculate a potential counteroffer.\n\nIf I propose to keep:\n- 5 units of item 1: 5 \u00d7 11 = 55\n- 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 63 = 63\n- 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 33 = 66\n- 4 units of item 4: 4 \u00d7 22 = 88\n- 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 32 = 32\n\nTotal Value of this Potential Offer = 55 + 63 + 66 + 88 + 32 = 304\n\nThis counteroffer would yield a value of 304, exceeding my outside offer value of 278.\n\nTherefore, my action will be to propose the following counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [5, 2, 2, 3, 1]}\n```\n\nThis counteroffer keeps more value for me than my outside offer and maximizes my payoff without giving less than my outside fallback.",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 586. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 705 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 2, 3, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    46 x 3 + 3 x 2 + 69 x 3 + 37 x 2 + 80 x 2\n    which is 585 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 586. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [4, 2, 1, 3, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [5, 2, 2, 3, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [5, 2, 2, 3, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 0, 5, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    69 x 4 + 14 x 0 + 92 x 5 + 7 x 1 + 76 x 3\n    which is 971 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 972. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 874. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 651 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 3, 3, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 3, 3, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Let's step through the questions systematically:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 874.\n   - **Values of Items:**\n     - Item 1: 75 per unit\n     - Item 2: 49 per unit\n     - Item 3: 31 per unit\n     - Item 4: 26 per unit\n     - Item 5: 36 per unit\n   - **Total Pool of Items:**\n     - 5 units of item 1\n     - 3 units of item 2\n     - 4 units of item 3\n     - 5 units of item 4\n     - 6 units of item 5\n   - **Influence of Discount Factor:** The discount factor (gamma = 0.98) influences my decision by decreasing the future value of offers. This means the sooner I reach a satisfactory agreement, the better, as later rounds reduce the value of potential offers.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current Offer (what I receive from Player 1): [2, 1, 3, 3, 1]**\n     - Item 1: 2 \u00d7 75 = 150\n     - Item 2: 1 \u00d7 49 = 49\n     - Item 3: 3 \u00d7 31 = 93\n     - Item 4: 3 \u00d7 26 = 78\n     - Item 5: 1 \u00d7 36 = 36\n     - Total value = 150 + 49 + 93 + 78 + 36 = 406\n   - Since 406 is significantly less than my outside offer of 874, accepting this offer is not favorable.\n\n3) **Make a Decision:**\n   - **Accept Current Offer?** No, because its value (406) is far below my outside offer (874).\n   - **Walk Away?** Not yet, because there is potential to negotiate a better outcome.\n   - **Propose a Counteroffer?** Yes. I should propose a counteroffer where my total value is at least 874. I will calculate a counteroffer that gives me a better value than my outside offer while still being reasonable.\n\nTo construct a counteroffer, I'll aim to maximize my value while ensuring Player 1 might still accept the offer. Let's try the following distribution:\n- Offer Player 1: [1, 1, 1, 2, 3]\n- My share will be: [4, 2, 3, 3, 3]\n\nCalculating my value:\n- Item 1: 4 \u00d7 75 = 300\n- Item 2: 2 \u00d7 49 = 98\n- Item 3: 3 \u00d7 31 = 93\n- Item 4: 3 \u00d7 26 = 78\n- Item 5: 3 \u00d7 36 = 108\n- Total value = 677\n\n677 is still below 874, so I need to adjust the counteroffer. Let's propose:\n- Offer Player 1: [1, 1, 1, 1, 2] (I've taken more of item 3 and item 4 since they have a lower value for me)\n\nMy new share will be: [4, 2, 3, 4, 4]\n\nCalculating my value:\n- Item 1: 4 \u00d7 75 = 300\n- Item 2: 2 \u00d7 49 = 98\n- Item 3: 3 \u00d7 31 = 93\n- Item 4: 4 \u00d7 26 = 104\n- Item 5: 4 \u00d7 36 = 144\n- Total value = 739\n\nWhile 739 is still below 874, this might represent an upper limit of how much I can push for, given the setup, and hence a better strategy might still develop through the rounds with possible adjustments based on Player 1's valuation perspective. \n\nHowever, avoiding mistakes such as making an offer below my outside offer value or gifting all or none to Player 1 must guide the refinement of a proposed counteroffer.\n\n**Therefore, my action is:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 2]}\n```",

This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 0, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    51 x 0 + 69 x 0 + 26 x 1 + 39 x 0 + 81 x 5\n    which is 431 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 432. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

It's also better than my initial offer.\n\nI could accept this offer, which is a good deal for me. Alternatively, I could make a counteroffer to try to get even more value, but I risk Player 2 walking away in the next round.\n\nLet me try a slightly improved counteroffer:\nIf I offered [2, 1, 2, 2, 2], I would keep [3, 2, 2, 3, 4]:\n- Item 1: 3 \u00d7 51 = 153\n- Item 2: 2 \u00d7 69 = 138\n- Item 3: 2 \u00d7 26 = 52\n- Item 4: 3 \u00d7 39 = 117\n- Item 5: 4 \u00d7 81 = 324\n- Total value: 784 \u00d7 0.98 = 768.32\n\nThis is worse than Player 2's current offer to me (882). \n\nLet me try another option:\nIf I offered [1, 1, 2, 2, 1], I would keep [4, 2, 2, 3, 5]:\n- Item 1: 4 \u00d7 51 = 204\n- Item 2: 2 \u00d7 69 = 138\n- Item 3: 2 \u00d7 26 = 52\n- Item 4: 3 \u00d7 39 = 117\n- Item 5: 5 \u00d7 81 = 405\n- Total value: 916 \u00d7 0.98 = 897.68\n\nThis is better than Player 2's offer. However, it's more aggressive and might risk Player 2 walking away.\n\nGiven that:\n1. The current offer from Player 2 is already very good (882 vs. 432 outside offer)\n2. We're in round 2 (of 3), so there's limited negotiation time left\n3. A more aggressive counteroffer might lead to Player 2 walking away\n\nI think the smartest move is to ACCEPT the current offer, which gives me excellent value well above my outside offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 571. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 783 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 0, 6, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    49 x 1 + 56 x 0 + 20 x 0 + 77 x 6 + 59 x 1\n    which is 570 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 571. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Item 4 (77 per unit)\n2. Item 5 (59 per unit)\n3. Item 2 (56 per unit)\n4. Item 1 (49 per unit)\n5. Item 3 (20 per unit)\n\nLet me try keeping most of my high-value items and offering more of the lower-value ones:\n\nPotential offer to Player 2: [1, 1, 5, 1, 1]\nThis means I keep: [1, 1, 1, 5, 3]\n\nValue to me if this offer is accepted:\n- Item 1: 1 \u00d7 49 = 49\n- Item 2: 1 \u00d7 56 = 56\n- Item 3: 1 \u00d7 20 = 20\n- Item 4: 5 \u00d7 77 = 385\n- Item 5: 3 \u00d7 59 = 177\n- Total = 687\n\nThis is well above my outside offer of 571, so it's a good initial offer.\n\n## 3) Decision Based on Analysis:\nSince this is the first round, I'll make a counteroffer that's favorable to me while still providing some value to Player 2. I want to keep most of the high-value items (especially item 4) while offering more of the lower-value items (especially item 3).\n\nThe offer [1, 1, 5, 1, 1] allows me to keep most of my high-value items while appearing reasonable to Player 2. This offer gives me a value of 687, which is significantly better than my outside offer of 571.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 5, 1, 1]}",

Since items 1 and 3 have lower value to me, I can offer more of these.\n\n### 3) Decision Making\n\nLet me propose an initial offer where I:\n- Keep all of item 5 (my highest value)\n- Keep most of items 2 and 4 (medium value)\n- Offer more of items 1 and 3 (lower value)\n\nSpecifically, I'll try:\n- Keep 1 unit of item 1, offer 3 units \u2192 I keep 1 \u00d7 24 = 24\n- Keep all item 2, offer 0 units \u2192 I keep 1 \u00d7 37 = 37\n- Keep 1 unit of item 3, offer 2 units \u2192 I keep 1 \u00d7 25 = 25\n- Keep all item 4, offer 0 units \u2192 I keep 2 \u00d7 37 = 74\n- Keep all item 5, offer 0 units \u2192 I keep 2 \u00d7 79 = 158\n\nMy total value: 24 + 37 + 25 + 74 + 158 = 318\nThis is well above my outside offer of 151, so this is a good starting point.\n\nI'll offer Player 2: [3, 0, 2, 0, 0]\nThis means I'm offering them 3 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 0, 2, 0, 0]}",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

It means that the value of offers in later rounds is slightly less compared to accepting an offer in the current round.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer: Player 1 is offering me [3, 0, 2, 0, 0].\n     - Value to me if I accept:\n       - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285\n       - 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 79 = 0\n       - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 66 = 132\n       - 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 50 = 0\n       - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 90 = 0\n     - Total value = 285 + 0 + 132 + 0 + 0 = 417\n   - Compare this value to my outside offer value of 132. Since 417 > 132, the current offer is better than my outside offer.\n   - Potential counteroffers: I could propose different distributions, but any proposal needs to provide me with more than 417 in total value to make it worthwhile.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - Accepting the current offer of [3, 0, 2, 0, 0] gives me a value of 417, which is significantly better than my outside offer of 132.\n   - Walking away would guarantee me 132, which is worse than the current offer.\n   - Since the current offer (417) is much better than my outside offer (132), accepting it is a rational choice.\n   - Proposing a counteroffer is unnecessary because the current offer is already quite favorable.\n\nGiven these considerations, my action is to accept the current offer:\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 3, 2, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    82 x 3 + 50 x 3 + 85 x 2 + 66 x 1 + 29 x 0\n    which is 632 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 633. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Let's analyze the current situation step by step:\n\n### 1) Analyze the current situation:\n\n- **What is my outside offer value?**\n  - My outside offer value is 435.\n\n- **What are the values of the items involved?**\n  - Value per unit:\n    - Item 1: 28\n    - Item 2: 87\n    - Item 3: 34\n    - Item 4: 48\n    - Item 5: 27\n\n- **What is the total pool of items?**\n  - Item 1: 5 units\n  - Item 2: 3 units\n  - Item 3: 5 units\n  - Item 4: 1 unit\n  - Item 5: 2 units\n\n- **How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?**\n  - The discount factor is 0.98, meaning the value of any agreement reached in round 2 will be multiplied by 0.98, and in round 3 by 0.98^2. This means a better offer could be worth less if delayed due to the discounting of future rounds.\n\n### 2) Assess the value of offers:\n\n- **For the current offer: What is my total value if I accept it?**\n  - Current offer: [1, 1, 1, 0, 1]\n  - Total value calculated:\n    - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 28 = 28\n    - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 87 = 87\n    - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 34 = 34\n    - 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 48 = 0\n    - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 27 = 27\n  - Total value = 28 + 87 + 34 + 0 + 27 = 176\n\n- **For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?**\n  - To secure a value close to or greater than my outside offer, I need a combination of items summing up to at least 435.\n\n- **How do these values compare to my outside offer value?**\n  - Current offer value (176) is significantly below my outside offer value (435), so accepting the current offer would be a mistake according to Mistake 4 (Accepting an offer worse than your outside offer).\n\n### 3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n\n- **Should I accept the current offer?**\n  - No, because the total value of the current offer (176) is much lower than my outside offer value (435).\n\n- **Should I walk away and take my outside offer?**\n  - Not yet, as it\u2019s round 1 and a counteroffer could result in a better deal.\n\n- **Should I propose a specific counteroffer?**\n  - Yes, I should propose a counteroffer that maximizes my value while being reasonable to Player 1.\n\n### Crafting a Counteroffer:\n\nLet's construct a counteroffer with a target to surpass my outside offer without exceeding the pool of items:\n\n- Proposed counteroffer:\n  - Item 1: 2 units (Remaining: 3 units)\n  - Item 2: 0 units (Remaining: 3 units)\n  - Item 3: 2 units (Remaining: 3 units)\n  - Item 4: 1 unit (Remaining: 0 units)\n  - Item 5: 1 unit (Remaining: 1 unit)\n\n**Calculation for my counteroffer:**\n- 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 28 = 84\n- 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261\n- 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102\n- 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 48 = 0\n- 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 27 = 27\n\nTotal value: 84 + 261 + 102 + 0 + 27 = 474\n\nThis value exceeds my outside offer (435), ensures a better deal, and does not make the mistakes listed.\n\nTherefore, my action will be to propose this counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 2, 1, 1]}\n```",
                    "action": "COUNTEROFFER"

                {
                    "prompt": "\n    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\n    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\n    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\n    There are 5 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\n    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\n    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 101.\n    Your private values are 82 for item 1, 50 for item 2, 85 for item 3, 66 for item 4, 29 for item 5.\n    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to your total value of all items, which is 1109. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 633. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 633. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 936 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 3, 2, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    82 x 3 + 50 x 3 + 85 x 2 + 66 x 1 + 29 x 0\n    which is 632 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 633. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 0, 2, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 0, 2, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
