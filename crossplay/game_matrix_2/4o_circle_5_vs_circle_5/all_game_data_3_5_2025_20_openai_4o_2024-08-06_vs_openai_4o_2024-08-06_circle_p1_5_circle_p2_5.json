Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 647. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 651 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 3, 8] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    62 x 0 + 42 x 1 + 35 x 0 + 4 x 3 + 74 x 8\n    which is 646 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 647. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Offer 2, where I propose to keep [3, 2, 2, 3, 7] items, yields a value of 870 which is better than my outside offer.\n\nTherefore, I will propose this counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 0, 2, 1]}",

Before that I should calculate what division maximizes my value while keeping Player 2 interested.\n\n  Assume I offer [1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 0 unit of item 4, 3 units of item 5] to Player 2:\n  - My kept items:\n    - 2 units of item 1: 2 x 1 = 2\n    - 2 units of item 2: 2 x 53 = 106\n    - 3 units of item 3: 3 x 92 = 276\n    - 1 unit of item 4: 1 x 22 = 22\n    - 3 units of item 5: 3 x 57 = 171\n  - Total value to me = 577\n\nComparing the 577 value to my outside offer of 93, the calculated value is significantly higher.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision Based on the Analysis\n- Since I haven't received an offer from Player 2 yet, I need to make an initial offer that ensures my value from the outcome is higher than my outside offer. The offer division where I hold on to a lot of highly valuable items is significant, giving me a total value of 577. \n\nThus, my move is to make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 3, 0, 3]}\n```\n\nThis offer is strategically aimed at holding enough of the higher valued items that maximize my return, while distributing items reasonably so as to keep Player 2 interested in the negotiation.",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 1, 4, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 6, 0, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    4 x 3 + 89 x 6 + 86 x 0 + 1 x 0 + 24 x 1\n    which is 570 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 587. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

Offer the rest to Player 2. \n\nMy value for this division:\n- I keep: \n  - 0 units of item 1: 0 \u00d7 4 = 0\n  - 7 units of item 2: 7 \u00d7 89 = 623\n  - 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 86 = 172\n  - 0 units of item 4: 0 \u00d7 1 = 0\n  - 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 24 = 24\n- Total value = 0 + 623 + 172 + 0 + 24 = 819\n\nThis value (819) is well above my outside offer of 587.\n\n### Step 3: Make a decision\nBased on this analysis, I should propose a counteroffer of [3, 2, 0, 0, 0] to Player 2, which maximizes my value above my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 2, 0, 0, 0]}\n```\n\nThis setup ensures I'm retaining value well above my outside offer, thus aligning with my objective to maximize my outcome within the negotiation rules.",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 1, 5, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    11 x 4 + 18 x 1 + 43 x 5 + 24 x 1 + 44 x 0\n    which is 301 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 302. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 2, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 2, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Let's analyze the current situation step-by-step:\n\n1) **Current Situation Analysis:**\n   - My outside offer value is 302.\n   - My values per unit for each item type are:\n     - Item 1: 11\n     - Item 2: 18\n     - Item 3: 43\n     - Item 4: 24\n     - Item 5: 44\n   - The total pool of items is [7, 1, 6, 2, 0].\n   - The discount factor is 0.98, which means that the value of any agreement will decrease slightly with each round due to the power (r-1) where r is the round number. So, waiting may slightly decrease the present value of future offers.\n\n2) **Assess the Current Offer:**\n   - The current offer to me is [1, 1, 2, 0, 0].\n   - Calculating the value of the current offer:\n     - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 11 = 11\n     - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 18 = 18\n     - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 43 = 86\n     - 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 24 = 0\n     - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 44 = 0\n     - Total value = 11 + 18 + 86 = 115, which is significantly less than my outside offer of 302.\n\n3) **Potential Counteroffers:**\n   - To avoid mistakes 2, 4, and 5, I need an offer that would be more valuable than my outside offer. For instance, consider keeping 4 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 4 of item 3, and 1 of item 4 (no units of item 5):\n     - 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 11 = 44\n     - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 18 = 18\n     - 4 units of item 3 = 4 \u00d7 43 = 172\n     - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 24 = 24\n     - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 44 = 0\n     - Total value = 258, still below my outside offer. \n\n   To maximize the value while ensuring I surpass my outside offer, another viable division is:\n   - Keep 5 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 5 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 0 of item 5. Offer the remainder to Player 1:\n     - 5 units of item 1 = 5 \u00d7 11 = 55\n     - 0 unit of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 18 = 0\n     - 5 units of item 3 = 5 \u00d7 43 = 215\n     - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 24 = 24\n     - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 44 = 0\n     - Total value = 55 + 0 + 215 + 24 = 294, almost reaching my outside offer. \n\n   Let\u2019s continue refining. Keep 6 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 1 of item 4, 0 of item 5:\n   - 6 units of item 1 = 6 \u00d7 11 = 66\n   - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 18 = 18\n   - 4 units of item 3 = 4 \u00d7 43 = 172\n   - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 24 = 24\n   - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 44 = 0\n   - Total value = 66 + 18 + 172 + 24 = 280, slightly better but still below.\n\nFinally, to surpass the outside offer, keep the maximum units of item 3 and add value through other items:\n- Keep 5 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 5 of item 3, 0 of item 4, and 0 of item 5. Offer the rest:\n   - 5 units of item 1 = 5 \u00d7 11 = 55\n   - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 18 = 18\n   - 5 units of item 3 = 5 \u00d7 43 = 215\n   - 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 24 = 0\n   - Total value = 55 + 18 + 215 = 288, needs a fine tune in 3rd or additional item utilization.\n\nDecision: \nSince the current offer [1, 1, 2, 0, 0] is only worth 115, which is less than my outside offer of 302, I should make a COUNTEROFFER that surpasses my outside offer value. Calculate keeping most critical item allocated to me item 3, and final attempt counter inclusive of larger utilizing items 1 to 6 item units:\n- Keep 6 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 4 of item 3, offer rest:\n\n- Offer max achievable mitigated units for lower valued would be partial aim for at least 0 and others without depressing acceptance above capacity mix.

The process concludes after round 2, following player 2's counteroffer being treated as WALK.\n\n2) **Assessing the Value of Offers:**\n   - The current offer on the table is [1, 0, 2, 0, 0] which means:\n     - I would receive 1 unit of Item 1, 0 units of Item 2, 2 units of Item 3, 0 units of Item 4, 0 units of Item 5.\n     - The total value of this offer to me is calculated as follows:\n       - 1 * 81 (Item 1) = 81\n       - 0 * 97 (Item 2) = 0\n       - 2 * 40 (Item 3) = 80\n       - 0 * 92 (Item 4) = 0\n       - Total value = 81 + 0 + 80 + 0 = 161\n   - Compare this offer value (161) with my outside offer value (56).

This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 1, 2, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    62 x 4 + 44 x 1 + 49 x 2 + 94 x 2 + 6 x 2\n    which is 590 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 591. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Thus, delaying might reduce the total value of any offer we accept.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer:**\n  - There is no current offer on the table.\n\n- **Potential Counteroffers:**\n  - I need to propose an offer that maximizes my benefit while still considering my outside offer of 214.\n\n#### Calculation of my value for possible divisions:\n\n1. **Full Allocation to Myself:**\n   - Item 1: 5 \u00d7 91 = 455\n   - Item 2: 0 \u00d7 84 = 0\n   - Item 3: 3 \u00d7 15 = 45\n   - Item 4: 1 \u00d7 52 = 52\n   - Item 5: 1 \u00d7 70 = 70\n   - Total = 622 (not possible to fully allocate to myself without proposal)\n\n2. **Example Offer (1): I keep [4, 0, 2, 1, 1], Give 1 of Item 1 and 1 of Item 3 to Player 2:**\n   - Value to me: \n     - Item 1: 4 \u00d7 91 = 364\n     - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 15 = 30\n     - Item 4: 1 \u00d7 52 = 52\n     - Item 5: 1 \u00d7 70 = 70\n     - Total = 516\n\n3. **Example Offer (2): I keep [3, 0, 2, 1, 0], Give 2 of Item 1, 1 of Item 5 and 1 of Item 3 to Player 2:**\n   - Value to me:\n     - Item 1: 3 \u00d7 91 = 273\n     - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 15 = 30\n     - Item 4: 1 \u00d7 52 = 52\n     - Total = 355\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision Based on the Analysis\n\n- The offer where I keep [4, 0, 2, 1, 1] items gives me a total value of 516, which is significantly better than my outside offer of 214.\n- As there is no current offer, accepting is not an option. \n\n- It's essential to propose an offer that's better than my outside offer value and avoid mistakes such as offering less than my fallback value.\n\n### Proposed Action\n\nI will provide an initial offer that retains a high value for myself while leaving flexibility for further negotiation. I'll go with a balanced offer that still provides me with significant value:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]}",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 0, 2, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    57 x 5 + 69 x 0 + 97 x 2 + 90 x 0 + 54 x 0\n    which is 479 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 487. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 0, 2, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    57 x 5 + 69 x 0 + 97 x 2 + 90 x 0 + 54 x 0\n    which is 479 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 487. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 1, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 0, 1, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "To determine the best action, let's walk through the analysis systematically:\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n\n   - My outside offer value is 487.\n   \n   - The values of the items to me are:\n     - Item 1: 57\n     - Item 2: 69\n     - Item 3: 97\n     - Item 4: 90\n     - Item 5: 54\n\n   - The total pool of items is: \n     - 5 units of item 1\n     - 0 units of item 2\n     - 3 units of item 3\n     - 1 unit of item 4\n     - 1 unit of item 5\n   \n   - Discount factor is 0.98; since we're in round 2, the value of an agreement this round is multiplied by \\(0.98^{1} = 0.98\\).\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n\n   - Current offer on the table: [2, 0, 1, 1, 0]\n     - My value if I accept:\n       - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 57 = 114\n       - 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 69 = 0\n       - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 97 = 97\n       - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 90 = 90\n       - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 54 = 0\n       - Total value = 114 + 0 + 97 + 90 + 0 = 301\n       - Discounted value in round 2 = 301 \u00d7 0.98 = 294.98\n\n   - Compare the discounted value of the current offer (294.98) to my outside offer (487). The current offer is significantly less valuable than my outside offer.\n\n3) Make a decision:\n   - The current offer's value (294.98) is less than my outside offer (487), so accepting it would be a mistake.\n   - Walking away would secure my outside offer of 487, which is better than the current offer.\n   - To prevent Mistake #5, I should consider making a counteroffer, but it must not be worse for me than walking away.\n\n   A strategy in this negotiation game is to ensure that any counteroffer provides more value than my outside offer. Given no item 2 and only 1 of item 4 and 5, maintaining higher value items (item 3) would be crucial since item 3 holds the highest value per unit at 97.\n\n   I can propose an allocation that focuses on increasing my weighted value and extracting more from item pools that deliver substantial returns. Let's try:\n\n   - [1, 0, 0, 1, 0] to the Player 1, keeping:\n     - 4 units of item 1\n     - 0 units of item 2\n     - 3 units of item 3\n     - 0 units of item 4\n     - 1 unit of item 5\n\n   Calculating values, if I keep this:\n   - 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 57 = 228\n   - 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 69 = 0\n   - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291\n   - 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 90 = 0\n   - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 54 = 54\n   - Total value = 228 + 0 + 291 + 0 + 54 = 573\n\n   This value is substantially greater than my outside offer value of 487, ensuring that I don't make Mistake #2.\n\nTherefore, I decide to propose a counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 422. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 717 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 3, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    82 x 2 + 34 x 0 + 11 x 3 + 78 x 2 + 34 x 2\n    which is 421 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 422. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 0, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 0, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Let's analyze the situation step-by-step:\n\n### 1) Current Situation Analysis\n\n- **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 422.\n  \n- **Item Values:**\n  - Item 1: 82 per unit\n  - Item 2: 34 per unit\n  - Item 3: 11 per unit\n  - Item 4: 78 per unit\n  - Item 5: 34 per unit\n\n- **Total Pool of Items:**\n  - Item 1: 2 units\n  - Item 2: 2 units\n  - Item 3: 4 units\n  - Item 4: 2 units\n  - Item 5: 4 units\n\n- **Discount Factor Influence:** The discount factor is 0.98. As rounds progress, the potential value decreases due to this factor, thus there is an incentive to resolve negotiations sooner rather than later.\n\n### 2) Assessing the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer on the Table (amount offered to me):** [2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5]\n\n  Calculation of Current Offer Value:\n  - Item 1: 2 units \u00d7 82 = 164\n  - Item 2: 1 unit \u00d7 34 = 34\n  - Item 3: 0 units \u00d7 11 = 0\n  - Item 4: 0 units \u00d7 78 = 0\n  - Item 5: 1 unit \u00d7 34 = 34\n  \n  **Total Value if Accepted:** 164 + 34 + 0 + 0 + 34 = 232\n  \n- **Comparison to Outside Offer:** \n  - The current offer's value to me (232) is significantly less than my outside offer value (422).\n\n### 3) Decision Making\n\n- **Option to Accept:** The current offer provides a value of 232, which is well below my outside offer of 422.\n  \n- **Option to Walk Away:** I can choose to walk away with the outside offer value of 422. Walking away now guarantees me 422, without considering the possibility of further negotiations.\n\n- **Option to Make a Counteroffer:** I can construct a counteroffer that provides me a value higher than 422. \n\n  Let's formulate a counteroffer:\n  - My objective is to retain items so that my value exceeds 422.\n  \n  Testing a counteroffer where I keep more valuable items:\n  - Offer Player 1: [0, 0, 2, 0, 4] (I keep 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5)\n\n  Calculating my value:\n  - Item 1: 2 units \u00d7 82 = 164\n  - Item 2: 2 units \u00d7 34 = 68\n  - Item 3: 2 units \u00d7 11 = 22\n  - Item 4: 2 units \u00d7 78 = 156\n  - Item 5: 0 unit \u00d7 34 = 0\n  \n  **Total Value of Counteroffer for Me:** 164 + 68 + 22 + 156 + 0 = 410\n\n  This proposed division returns a value of 410, which is still less than my outside offer of 422. Therefore, I need to keep more items with higher value.\n\nContinuing to adjust:\n  - Offer Player 1: [0, 1, 0, 0, 2] - (I keep 2 units of item 1, 1 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5)\n  \n  Calculating my value from this adjustment:\n  - Item 1: 2 units \u00d7 82 = 164\n  - Item 2: 1 unit \u00d7 34 = 34\n  - Item 3: 4 units \u00d7 11 = 44\n  - Item 4: 2 units \u00d7 78 = 156\n  - Item 5: 2 units \u00d7 34 = 68\n  \n  **Total Value of Adjusted Counteroffer:** 164 + 34 + 44 + 156 + 68 = 466\n\nFinally, I arrive at a counteroffer where my value is 466, which is better than my outside offer of 422.\n\nThus, I will propose this as my counteroffer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 0, 2]}",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 496. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 801 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 1, 0, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    40 x 2 + 21 x 1 + 9 x 0 + 99 x 2 + 98 x 2\n    which is 495 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 496. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 496. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 801 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 1, 0, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    40 x 2 + 21 x 1 + 9 x 0 + 99 x 2 + 98 x 2\n    which is 495 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 496. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 4, 4, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 4, 1, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 4, 1, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 1, 0, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    40 x 2 + 21 x 1 + 9 x 0 + 99 x 2 + 98 x 2\n    which is 495 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 496. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 4, 4, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 4, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [3, 1, 3, 2, 2]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [1, 4, 4, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 4, 4, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

This gives Player 2 [4, 3, 3, 1, 2].\n     - Value for Player 1:\n       - Item 1: 3 \u00d7 12 = 36\n       - Item 2: 4 \u00d7 2 = 8\n       - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 98 = 196\n       - Item 4: 1 \u00d7 46 = 46\n       - Item 5: 4 \u00d7 37 = 148\n     - Total value = 36 + 8 + 196 + 46 + 148 = 434 (which is less than 483)\n\n   Let's try another division:\n   - Retain [4, 3, 3, 1, 3].

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1564. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 879 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [7, 6, 4, 2, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    44 x 7 + 63 x 6 + 55 x 4 + 33 x 2 + 98 x 6\n    which is 1560 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1564. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 4, 2, 1, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 4, 2, 1, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 2, 2, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    45 x 0 + 29 x 0 + 45 x 2 + 54 x 2 + 1 x 4\n    which is 202 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 203. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 1, 0, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    39 x 1 + 60 x 0 + 91 x 1 + 14 x 0 + 46 x 4\n    which is 314 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 315. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 2, 5, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    38 x 1 + 75 x 0 + 98 x 2 + 16 x 5 + 77 x 3\n    which is 545 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 546. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "To determine the best action, let's analyze the current situation step by step:\n\n1. **Analyze the Current Situation:**\n\n   - My outside offer value: 546\n   - Values of the items involved:\n     - Item 1: 38 per unit\n     - Item 2: 75 per unit\n     - Item 3: 98 per unit\n     - Item 4: 16 per unit\n     - Item 5: 77 per unit\n   - Total pool of items:\n     - 3 units of item 1\n     - 2 units of item 2\n     - 2 units of item 3\n     - 5 units of item 4\n     - 3 units of item 5\n   - Discount factor influence:\n     - Since we are in round 1, the discount factor (gamma) hasn't affected the present value yet. Each subsequent round decreases the effective value of offers by multiplying by 0.98 for each round past the first.\n\n2. **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n\n   - Current offer on the table: [0, 0, 0, 2, 1] (I receive 2 units of item 4 and 1 unit of item 5)\n     - Value to me if I accept it: \n       - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 16 = 32\n       - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 77 = 77\n       - Total value = 32 + 77 = 109\n\n   - Compare this with my outside offer of 546. The current offer is significantly worse than my outside offer.\n\n3. **Make a Decision Based on the Analysis:**\n\n   - The current offer gives me a total value of 109, which is far less than my outside offer value of 546. Accepting it would be making Mistake 4 (accepting an offer worse than my outside offer).\n   - Walking away now would guarantee me the outside offer value of 546. However, it's round 1, and there's room for negotiation.\n   - I should make a counteroffer that provides me with a value greater than my outside offer. \n\nLet's create a counteroffer to maximize my value:\n- To exceed my outside offer value, I need to manipulate the distribution of the items in my favor.\n- Let's make a counteroffer where I keep more valuable items, fitting within the constraint of the total available items while exceeding my outside offer value.\n\nOne possible counteroffer is:\n- Give Player 1: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2]\n- For me: [3, 2, 2, 3, 1]\n\nCalculate the value of this offer to me:\n- Item 1: 3 \u00d7 38 = 114\n- Item 2: 2 \u00d7 75 = 150\n- Item 3: 2 \u00d7 98 = 196\n- Item 4: 3 \u00d7 16 = 48\n- Item 5: 1 \u00d7 77 = 77\n- Total value for me = 114 + 150 + 196 + 48 + 77 = 585\n\nBy keeping this configuration, my total value is 585, which is greater than my outside offer of 546.\n\nThus, my action is to make this counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 2, 2]}\n```",

Let's attempt a fair division that I propose to Player 2:\n\nAssume I propose to give:\n- Item 1: 1 unit to Player 2 (I keep 2)\n- Item 2: 2 units to Player 2 (I keep 2)\n- Item 3: 1 unit to Player 2 (I keep 1)\n- Item 4: 2 units to Player 2 (I keep 2)\n- Item 5: 1 unit to Player 2 (I keep 2)\n\n**Calculate my retention value:**\n   - I receive:\n     - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 14 = 28\n     - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 38 = 76\n     - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 85 = 85\n     - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 85 = 170\n     - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 42 = 84\n   - Total value to me = 28 + 76 + 85 + 170 + 84 = 443\n\nThis result (443) doesn't exceed my outside offer (551), so I need to improve the offer:\n\nI will adjust to keep a higher value while still remaining reasonable to Player 2, ensuring my total value exceeds 551:\n\nLet's try:\n- Item 1: 0 units to Player 2 (I keep 3)\n- Item 2: 1 unit to Player 2 (I keep 3)\n- Item 3: 0 units to Player 2 (I keep 2)\n- Item 4: 1 unit to Player 2 (I keep 3)\n- Item 5: 1 unit to Player 2 (I keep 2)\n\n**Calculate my new retention value:**\n   - I receive:\n     - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42\n     - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 38 = 114\n     - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 85 = 170\n     - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 85 = 255\n     - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 42 = 84\n   - Total value to me = 42 + 114 + 170 + 255 + 84 = 665\n\nThis proposed split, while strategic, successfully maximizes the return above my fallback offer. It surpasses my outside offer significantly, and is a sound initial offer. \n\n**Decision:**\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 1, 1]}",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 613. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 613. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 888 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 2, 2, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    46 x 0 + 46 x 3 + 38 x 2 + 100 x 2 + 66 x 3\n    which is 612 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 613. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 613. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 888 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 2, 2, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    46 x 0 + 46 x 3 + 38 x 2 + 100 x 2 + 66 x 3\n    which is 612 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 613. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 3, 2, 1, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 2, 3, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 2, 3, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 2, 4, 1, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party.

It will become relevant in rounds 2 and 3, reducing the value of future offers.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the value of offers\n- **Current offer to analyze**: None, since there is no offer on the table.\n- **Potential counteroffers**: I need to propose an initial offer, ensuring that the value for me is higher than my outside offer of 1012.\n\nLet's calculate the value of several allocations where I keep different combinations of items to maximize my value:\n\n#### Option 1: I keep as many high-value items as possible:\n- Keep 4 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 1 of item 4, 5 of item 5.\n  - Value = 4\u00d766 + 2\u00d782 + 4\u00d768 + 1\u00d713 + 5\u00d766 = 264 + 164 + 272 + 13 + 330 = 1043\n  - This is above my outside offer, so it's a valid starting point.\n\n### Step 3: Make a decision\nBased on the above steps, since I can achieve a total value of 1043 by not offering any items to Player 2, which is greater than my outside offer of 1012, I should ensure my first offer is advantageous to me and aligned with this value. However, making an offer of giving zero items is suboptimal early on.\n\nTo start the negotiation process and avoid mistake 3 (offering all or none), I'll offer a minimal amount that still keeps my retention advantageous, thus maximizing negotiation potential while staying above my outside offer value.\n\nLet's make an initial reasonable offer by giving Player 2 a minimal number of units of the lower-value items (to me) to retain the most value:\n\n#### Proposed Initial Offer\n- Offer 0, 0, 0, 1, 0 to Player 2. This gives away only the single unit of item 4, having a minimal impact on my total retained value:\n\n- **Retained value** = 4\u00d766 + 2\u00d782 + 4\u00d768 + 0\u00d713 + 5\u00d766 = 1043, which remains above my outside value, 1012.\n- This avoids offering zero and still gives me a value higher than my outside offer.\n\nHere is my action:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]}\n```",

If I accept later, slightly reducing the value.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n- **Current offer from Player 1**: [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n  - My value for accepting this offer:\n    - 0 units of item 1 = 0\n    - 0 units of item 2 = 0\n    - 0 units of item 3 = 0\n    - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 85 = 85\n    - 0 units of item 5 = 0\n  - Total value = 85\n\nSince 85 is less than my outside offer of 527, accepting this offer would be suboptimal.\n\nNext, let's consider making a counteroffer that has a value greater than 527 for me.\n\n**Example Counteroffer Calculation:**\n- I need a value of at least 527 to counteract my outside offer.\n- Consider keeping the following for myself:\n  - 4 units of item 1 (4 \u00d7 48 = 192)\n  - 1 unit of item 2 (1 \u00d7 6 = 6)\n  - 4 units of item 3 (4 \u00d7 82 = 328)\n  - 0 units of item 4 (0 \u00d7 85 = 0)\n  - 0 units of item 5 (0 \u00d7 40 = 0)\n- Total value = 192 + 6 + 328 = 526\n\nThis is slightly below my outside offer. I need to adjust the allocation to ensure my total value is above 527. Let's try another allocation:\n\n- Consider keeping:\n  - 4 units of item 1 (4 \u00d7 48 = 192)\n  - 0 units of item 2 (0 \u00d7 6 = 0)\n  - 4 units of item 3 (4 \u00d7 82 = 328)\n  - 0 units of item 4 (0 \u00d7 85 = 0)\n  - 0 units of item 5 (0 \u00d7 40 = 0)\n- Total value = 192 + 328 = 520\n\nAdjust again:\n\n- Keep:\n  - 4 units of item 1 (4 \u00d7 48 = 192)\n  - 0 units of item 2 (0 \u00d7 6 = 0)\n  - 3 units of item 3 (3 \u00d7 82 = 246)\n  - 1 unit of item 4 (1 \u00d7 85 = 85)\n  - 0 units of item 5 (0 \u00d7 40 = 0)\n- Total value = 192 + 246 + 85 = 523\n\nContinue to adjust:\n\n- Keep:\n  - 4 units of item 1 (4 \u00d7 48 = 192)\n  - 0 units of item 2 (0 \u00d7 6 = 0)\n  - 3 units of item 3 (3 \u00d7 82 = 246)\n  - 1 unit of item 4 (1 \u00d7 85 = 85)\n  - 1 unit of item 5 (1 \u00d7 40 = 40)\n- Total value = 192 + 246 + 85 + 40 = 563\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\nThe total value of 563 is greater than my outside offer of 527, and it's an acceptable counteroffer. Now let's form a valid counteroffer.\n\n- To achieve a total value greater than 527 for me, I give Player 1 this counteroffer: [0, 2, 1, 0, 4]\n\nThe values of what I keep with this counteroffer would be:\n- Keep the remaining (4, 0, 3, 1, 1) for myself:\n  - 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 48 = 192\n  - 0 units of item 2 = 0\n  - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246\n  - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 85 = 85\n  - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 40 = 40\n- Total value = 192 + 246 + 85 + 40 = 563, which is above 527.\n\nThus, the action is:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 1, 0, 4]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1012. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 885 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 2, 4, 1, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    66 x 3 + 82 x 2 + 68 x 4 + 13 x 1 + 66 x 5\n    which is 977 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1012. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 2, 1, 0, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 1, 0, 4]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To decide which course of action to take, let's analyze the situation step by step based on the information provided:\n\n### 1) Analyze the Current Situation\n- **My Outside Offer Value:** 1012\n- **Values of Items Involved:**\n  - Item 1: 66 per unit\n  - Item 2: 82 per unit\n  - Item 3: 68 per unit\n  - Item 4: 13 per unit\n  - Item 5: 66 per unit\n- **Total Pool of Items:**\n  - 4 units of item 1\n  - 2 units of item 2\n  - 4 units of item 3\n  - 1 unit of item 4\n  - 5 units of item 5\n- **Discount Factor Influence:** We're currently in round 2 with a discount factor of 0.98, which means that any future value will be reduced by this factor. Thus, delaying our decision might affect the negotiated value unless the proposal is significantly better.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers\n- **Current Offer Value if I Accept:**\n  - For current offer [0, 2, 1, 0, 4], calculate:\n    - 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 66 = 0\n    - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 82 = 164\n    - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 68 = 68\n    - 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 13 = 0\n    - 4 units of item 5 = 4 \u00d7 66 = 264\n  - Total value = 164 + 68 + 264 = 496\n\n- **Comparison with Outside Offer:** 496 is less than my outside offer value of 1012.\n\n- **Potential Counteroffers:**\n  - I need to propose a division where my retained value is greater than 1012, considering the discount factor. A wise choice would be retaining a high value combination of items.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision\n- **Should I Accept the Current Offer?**\n  - The current offer gives me a value of 496, which is significantly lower than my outside offer of 1012. Thus, accepting is not advisable.\n\n- **Should I Walk Away?**\n  - Walking away guarantees me 1012, the value of my outside offer. It is a safe option but I'd like to explore a counteroffer which may yield higher value.\n\n- **Propose a Counteroffer:**\n  - Let's explore a potential offer: retain as many high-value items (based on my valuations) as possible.\n  - Idea: Retain more units of item 2 and item 3, as they have higher per unit values for me.\n\n### Hypothetical Counteroffer\n- I propose keeping all units to myself except minimal count of certain items to player 2 such as:\n  - Offer Player 2: [0, 2, 2, 0, 2] (giving them lower valued units to me)\n\n- **My Value Keeping [4, 0, 2, 1, 3]:**\n  - 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 66 = 264\n  - 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 82 = 0\n  - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 68 = 136\n  - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 13 = 13\n  - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198\n  - Total value = 264 + 0 + 136 + 13 + 198 = 611\n\nThe value of 611 would be further discounted by the factor of 0.98 from round 2 if it reaches acceptance.\n\nHere, despite the item distribution, if the resulting value still doesn\u2019t meet or surpass my outside offer of 1012 with considered discounting, then WALK is preferable to guarantee 1012.\n\nGiven this assessment, I choose to:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 0, 0, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    62 x 3 + 53 x 0 + 65 x 0 + 94 x 0 + 73 x 1\n    which is 259 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 260.

Let's evaluate a reasonable initial offer:\n\n   Suppose the division is such that I start with more valuable items satisfying my outside offer and strategic allocation:\n   - Keep: 4 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 (high-value items)\n   - Offer: 6 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3\n\n   Calculating the value:\n   - Item 4: 4 \u00d7 94 = 376\n   - Item 5: 2 \u00d7 73 = 146\n\n   Total value from keeping these items: 376 + 146 = 522\n\n   This setup offers me a value of 522, significantly higher than my outside offer of 260.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\n   Since there is no existing offer, I will propose a counteroffer that ensures my retained value is higher than my outside offer and is justifiable as not giving away all or none of the items.\n\n   **Proposed Counteroffer:** Offer all units except for the most valuable items of mine.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [6, 5, 6, 0, 0]}\n```\n\nThis strategy allows me to keep high-value items while giving a more equitable and potentially acceptable division to Player 2.",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 0, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    25 x 2 + 55 x 0 + 65 x 0 + 58 x 0 + 44 x 1\n    which is 94 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 95. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

Now, I determine a division strategy that maximizes my value while being reasonable.\n\nLet's propose a counteroffer and calculate its value to me:\n\nSuppose I propose keeping the following for myself:\n- Item 1: 2 units\n- Item 2: 3 units\n- Item 3: 2 units (offer 1 to Player 2)\n- Item 4: 4 units (offer 2 to Player 2)\n- Item 5: 3 units (offer 3 to Player 2)\n\n- **My Value:**\n  - 2 units of Item 1: \\(2 \\times 25 = 50\\)\n  - 3 units of Item 2: \\(3 \\times 55 = 165\\)\n  - 2 units of Item 3: \\(2 \\times 65 = 130\\)\n  - 4 units of Item 4: \\(4 \\times 58 = 232\\)\n  - 3 units of Item 5: \\(3 \\times 44 = 132\\)\n\n- **Total Value to Me:** \\(50 + 165 + 130 + 232 + 132 = 709\\)\n\n### 3) Make a Decision:\n\n- The calculated total value of 709 is significantly higher than my outside offer of 95 and reflects a reasonable offer to Player 2 while keeping a substantial portion of the total value for myself.\n- This division should keep me within my objectives without making any of the outlined negotiation mistakes.\n\n**Proposed Action:**\nOffer Player 2 the items I planned to give them in the above proposal. Here is my action in the required format:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 2, 3]}\n```\n\nThis means I'm proposing to give Player 2: 0 units of Item 1, 0 units of Item 2, 1 unit of Item 3, 2 units of Item 4, and 3 units of Item 5.",
