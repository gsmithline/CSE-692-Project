Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 724. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 724. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 684 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n- **My outside offer value:** 724\n- **Values of the items involved (per unit):**\n  - Item 1: 63\n  - Item 2: 31\n  - Item 3: 84\n  - Item 4: 45\n  - Item 5: 5\n\n- **Total pool of items:**\n  - 3 units of item 1\n  - 2 units of item 2\n  - 5 units of item 3\n  - 4 units of item 4\n  - 1 unit of item 5\n\n- **Discount factor:** The discount factor is 0.98, which means that the value of offers diminishes with each round. Acting earlier in the negotiation might provide a higher value due to less discounting.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n- **Current offer value:** There is no current offer on the table.\n\n- **Assess potential counteroffers:** I want to propose offers that are better than my outside offer of 724, after considering the discount factor. Ideally, I want to retain the higher-value items (based on my private values) and give away lower-value items.\n\n**Calculating my total potential value for different distributions:**\n\nAssuming I offer Player 2 one possible allocation of items that ensures I keep most of the high-value items:\n\n1. **Proposed Counteroffer:** \n   - Give Player 2:\n     - 0 units of item 1, \n     - 0 units of item 2, \n     - 3 units of item 3,\n     - 1 unit of item 4,\n     - 0 units of item 5\n\n2. **My Remaining from Proposing:**\n   - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189\n   - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 31 = 62\n   - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 84 = 168\n   - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135\n   - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 5 = 5\n   - Total value = 559\n\nThis total of 559 is less than my outside offer of 724. Therefore, I need to adjust the proposed counteroffer to increase my value while ensuring it's still valuable enough for Player 2 to consider.\n\nLet's try another division where I keep more high-value items:\n\n3. **Adjusted Proposed Counteroffer:** \n   - Give Player 2:\n     - 1 unit of item 1, \n     - 0 units of item 2, \n     - 1 unit of item 3,\n     - 1 unit of item 4,\n     - 1 unit of item 5\n\n4. **My Remaining from Proposing:**\n   - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 63 = 126\n   - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 31 = 62\n   - 4 units of item 3 = 4 \u00d7 84 = 336\n   - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135\n   - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 5 = 0\n   - Total value = 659\n\nThis still does not give me a value higher than 724. Let me iterate again:\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\nGiven that Player 1 aims to maximize my value above 724 with potential offers, let's try a minimal distribution:\n\n5. **Another Proposed Counteroffer:**\n   - Give Player 2:\n     - 0 units of item 1, \n     - 1 unit of item 2, \n     - 0 units of item 3, \n     - 2 units of item 4, \n     - 1 units of item 5\n\n6. **My Remaining from Proposing:**\n   - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189\n   - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 31 = 31\n   - 5 units of item 3 = 5 \u00d7 84 = 420\n   - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 45 = 90\n   - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 5 = 0\n   - Total value = 730\n\nNow I have a proposed offer where my total is 730, which exceeds my outside offer of 724. With this offer, I ensure a higher personal value and create an initial proposal for negotiation.\n\n**Decision:** \nBased on this analysis, I will make the following counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 2, 1]}\n```",

Hence, let's limit more on the allocation to Player 2.\n\n3) Propose a specific counteroffer:\n   I will propose the following offer for Player 2:\n   - 0 units of item 1 (I keep all 6)\n   - 2 units of item 2 (I keep 2)\n   - 1 unit of item 3 (I keep 1)\n   - 1 unit of item 4 (I keep 2)\n   - 0 unit of item 5 (I keep 1)\n\n   Calculation for this offer:\n   - For my keeping:\n     - 6 units of item 1: 6 \u00d7 20 = 120\n     - 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 55 = 110\n     - 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 22 = 22\n     - 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 53 = 106\n     - 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 51 = 51\n   - Total value = 120 + 110 + 22 + 106 + 51 = 409\n\n   This value is still below 477; therefore, these numbers cannot be effective.\n\n   Let's revise keeping:\n   - 1 unit of item 1 (I keep 5) - provides 20 value \n   - 3 units of item 2 (I keep 1) - provides 165 value\n   - 1 unit of item 3 (I keep 1) - provides 22 value\n   - 1 unit of item 4 (I keep 2) - provides 53 value\n   - 0 units of item 5 (I keep 1) - provides 0 value\n\n   Items for Player 2:\n   - 5 units of item 1\n   - 1 unit of item 2\n   - 1 unit of item 3\n   - 2 units of item 4\n   - 1 unit of item 5\n\n   Calculating total value for Player 2 would be 110 + 22 + 53 = 185, and for me 20 + 165 + 22 + 53 = 270 lower than 477 where the sum of these would be acceptable in a single-player negotiation game, but given parameter absence of any offers requires walk as no other moves justified clear.\n\nGiven this, as my potential offer we've assessed tries included, sum evaluations likely to fall in abeyance to confidence protection best choice to meet prior in honest objective (versus unacceptable risk).

The main objective is to ensure I retain a total value greater than or equal to 775 because walking away could be suboptimal if a better deal is achievable.\n\n- Start by estimating distributions where my net value surpasses 775:\n  - I need to calculate allocations where my utility is maximized or at least provides me with a net positive value above my outside offer.\n\nHere's an example breakdown where I try to ensure I get a better value:\n\n - Let's propose an offer keeping more high-value items with me:\n   - I keep 2 units of item 1 (worth 8) and offer 2 to Player 2.\n   - I keep 3 units of item 2 (worth 45) and offer 3 to Player 2.\n   - I keep 1 unit of item 3 (worth 89) and offer 3 to Player 2.\n   - I keep all 6 units of item 4 (worth 564) and offer 0 to Player 2.\n   - I keep all 2 units of item 5 (worth 158) and offer 0 to Player 2.\n\n   Summing my kept values: \n   2(4) + 3(15) + 1(89) + 6(94) + 2(79) = 8 + 45 + 89 + 564 + 158 = 864\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - The proposed counteroffer allocates me a total value of 864.\n   - This value is greater than my outside offer of 775, ensuring I achieve a favorable outcome. \n   - Therefore, a reasonable initial negotiation strategy would involve offering Player 2 lower valued items according to my valuation to get a favorable division, while retaining higher-valued items for myself.\n\nThus, my action is:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 3, 3, 0, 0]}\n```",

My private values per unit are: item1 76, item2 68, item3 26, item4 58, and item5 88, so if I got everything I\u2019d value the whole bundle at 704.

(Any deal I accept must beat my guaranteed 504.) To get a deal worth at least 504 to me out of the total 704 the maximum \u201ccost\u201d I can concede is 704\u00a0\u2013 504 = 200 (in my own value units). In principle I might try to design an offer that gives me exactly 504 while \u201cbuying\u201d the rest for Player\u202f1. But because the items are indivisible (and there are only fixed numbers of each type) and my cost for each item is very different from the opponent\u2019s expected per\u2010unit value (which is roughly 51 if we assume a uniform [1,101] draw), I found that to give Player\u202f1 even a modest expected gain (say roughly 300 in his units) I\u2019d have to \u201cspend\u201d far more than 200 of my value. In short, it isn\u2019t possible to carve up the items so that I get at least 504 while giving him an allocation that he\u2019d be happy accepting (given his outside offer is drawn from [1, their total value] and his expected reservation is around 280\u2013300).\n\nThus, even though I might like to counteroffer so that eventually the split improves my share relative to the current 324, any counteroffer that guarantees me at least my safe 504 would leave so little (by my own measurements) for Player\u202f1 that he very likely would not accept the deal (preferring instead his own outside option).\n\nIn this round 1 situation I already have a safe fallback that gives me 504. Since the current offer is considerably worse and any counteroffer that meets my threshold would be too \u201ctight\u201d for Player\u202f1, my best move is indeed not to try to make a counteroffer but to WALK away so that the negotiation ends and I secure my 504. \n\nTherefore, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Since this is the first round, the discount factor doesn't apply yet, but it will affect future rounds if the negotiation extends.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\nSince there is no current offer on the table from Player 2 (it's the first round, and I need to make the initial offer), I'll consider potential divisions for my offer. I need a division that ensures my total value is greater than my outside offer of 180.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I keep a significant share of the high-value items:\n\n- **Offer:** I will offer Player 2 the following:\n  - 0 units of item 1 (I keep both units for a value of 168 = 2 x 84)\n  - 2 units of item 2 (I keep 4 units for a value of 160 = 4 x 40)\n  - 2 units of item 3 (I keep 3 units for a value of 180 = 3 x 60)\n  - 0 units of item 4 (I keep all 3 units for a value of 288 = 3 x 96)\n  - 3 units of item 5 (I keep 3 units for a value of 198 = 3 x 66)\n\n- **My Total Value:**\n  - Item 1: 168\n  - Item 2: 160\n  - Item 3: 180\n  - Item 4: 288\n  - Item 5: 198\n  - Total = 994\n\nThis offer ensures that I have a total item value of 994, which is significantly higher than my outside offer of 180.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\nGiven the high total value of 994 from this proposed division, compared to my outside offer value of 180, making this offer is advantageous. \n\nThus, I will make the following counteroffer to Player 2:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 2, 0, 3]}\n```\n\nThis offer represents a strong position for me in the initial round.",

(The totals available are 2, 6, 5, 3, 6 respectively.) In the current offer Player\u00a01 is giving me [0, 2, 2, 0, 3], which in my own values comes to  \n\u2003\u20030\u00d712 + 2\u00d74 + 2\u00d743 + 0\u00d792 + 3\u00d742 = 0 + 8 + 86 + 0 + 126 = 220.  \nThat is much lower than my outside option of 583. So I must counteroffer.\n\nStep 2: In any counteroffer I propose, I \u201coffer\u201d Player\u00a01 some amounts and keep the rest. (My share from any proposal is the total available minus what I give to Player\u00a01.) Thus, if I offer Player\u00a01 an allocation T = [t\u2081, t\u2082, t\u2083, t\u2084, t\u2085] then my share is  \n\u2003\u2003[2\u2013t\u2081, 6\u2013t\u2082, 5\u2013t\u2083, 3\u2013t\u2084, 6\u2013t\u2085]  \nand my value is  \n\u2003\u2003(2\u2013t\u2081)*12 + (6\u2013t\u2082)*4 + (5\u2013t\u2083)*43 + (3\u2013t\u2084)*92 + (6\u2013t\u2085)*42.  \nSince the total sum of values is 791, my share\u2019s value equals 791 minus what I \u201cgive up\u201d (computed as 12t\u2081 + 4t\u2082 + 43t\u2083 + 92t\u2084 + 42t\u2085).  \nTo do better than my fallback 583, I need:  \n\u2003\u2003791 \u2013 (12t\u2081 + 4t\u2082 + 43t\u2083 + 92t\u2084 + 42t\u2085) \u2265 583  \n\u27f9 12t\u2081 + 4t\u2082 + 43t\u2083 + 92t\u2084 + 42t\u2085 \u2264 208.\n\nStep 3: I aim to \u201csell\u201d as little as possible from items I value highly. My lowest\u2010value item is item\u00a02 (4 per unit), so it is natural to concede all of item\u00a02. Similarly, item\u00a01 (at 12/unit) is relatively cheap. So I set:  \n\u2003\u2003t\u2081 = 2 and t\u2082 = 6  \ngiving a \u201ccost\u201d of 2\u00d712 + 6\u00d74 = 24 + 24 = 48.  \nThis leaves me with an allowable \u201ccost quota\u201d of 208 \u2013 48 = 160 that I could assign from items 3, 4, and 5.  \nI now want to design a counteroffer that gives me a good share above my fallback but also might be acceptable to Player\u00a01. A natural idea is to \u201caim\u201d for nearly my reservation payoff but try to improve upon it. For instance, if I target my own share\u2019s value to be 616 (which is above 583), then the amount \u201cgiven up\u201d is 791 \u2013 616 = 175. We already have 48 from items 1 and 2, leaving 175 \u2013 48 = 127 to be \u201cspent\u201d on items 3, 4, and 5.  \nI then look for integers t\u2083, t\u2084, t\u2085 satisfying:  \n\u2003\u200343t\u2083 + 92t\u2084 + 42t\u2085 = 127  \nOne simple solution is to set t\u2084 = 0 and then try t\u2083 = 1. With t\u2083 = 1 we get 43 + 42t\u2085 = 127,  \n\u27f9 42t\u2085 = 84, so t\u2085 = 2.  \nThis is feasible because the totals allow t\u2083 up to 5 and t\u2085 up to 6.\n\nStep 4: Thus my counteroffer allocates to Player\u00a01:  \n\u2003\u2003t\u2081 = 2, t\u2082 = 6, t\u2083 = 1, t\u2084 = 0, t\u2085 = 2  \nand I keep:  \n\u2003\u2003Item\u00a01: 2 \u2013 2 = 0  \n\u2003\u2003Item\u00a02: 6 \u2013 6 = 0  \n\u2003\u2003Item\u00a03: 5 \u2013 1 = 4  \n\u2003\u2003Item\u00a04: 3 \u2013 0 = 3  \n\u2003\u2003Item\u00a05: 6 \u2013 2 = 4  \nMy payoff then is: 0\u00d712 + 0\u00d74 + 4\u00d743 + 3\u00d792 + 4\u00d742 = 172 + 276 + 168 = 616, which beats my fallback of 583.  \nMoreover, I\u2019ve conceded a \u201ctotal cost\u201d of 2\u00d712 + 6\u00d74 + 1\u00d743 + 0\u00d792 + 2\u00d742 = 24 + 24 + 43 + 0 + 84 = 175 (well within the limit of 208) and thus the trade\u2010off likely improves the chance that Player\u00a01 will consider the proposal.\n\nStep 5: Given this reasoning, my action is to counteroffer with allocation [2, 6, 1, 0, 2] to Player\u00a01 (meaning I propose that Player\u00a01 gets these items and I keep the remainder).\n\nThus, my answer is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 6, 1, 0, 2]}",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items.

This will reduce the effective value of accepting an offer after this round.\n\n### 2) Assess the value of offers:\n\n- **Current Offer from Player 2:** [2, 6, 1, 0, 2] (the number of items I'm offered)\n  \n  Let's calculate the total value of these items:\n  - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 84 = 168\n  - 6 units of item 2 = 6 \u00d7 40 = 240\n  - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 60 = 60\n  - 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 96 = 0\n  - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 66 = 132\n  \n  Total value = 168 + 240 + 60 + 0 + 132 = 600\n  \n  Discounted value = 600 \u00d7 0.98 = 588\n\n- **Comparison with Outside Offer:** My outside offer is 180. The discounted value of accepting the current offer is 588, which is much higher than 180.\n\n### 3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n\nGiven the information:\n\n- The current offer provides me with a value (588) much higher than my outside offer (180). \n- Accepting this offer avoids the risk of Player 2 walking away if they do not find further negotiation advantageous.\n- This is round 2, and the opportunity for further rounds may lead to diminished returns due to the discount factor.\n\nSince the current offer yields a significantly higher value than my outside offer, it is beneficial and optimal to accept this offer rather than walk away or propose a counteroffer which could lead to further reductions in value due to the discount factor or Player 2's decision to walk away.\n\nThus, my decision is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

In expectation P1 (with uniformly drawn values) will \u201ccare more\u201d about items we value less.\nSo a good strategy is to concede the items we don\u2019t care about \u2013 namely, all of items 2, 4, and 5 \u2013 while keeping full control over the high\u2010value items 1 and 3.\n\n5. Consider the following proposal:\n\u2003Offer Player 1 all of items 2, 4, and 5. That is:\n\u2003\u2003x2 = 2\u2003\u2003(the entire two units)\n\u2003\u2003x4 = 5\u2003\u2003(all five units)\n\u2003\u2003x5 = 4\u2003\u2003(all four units)\nAnd give them nothing of items 1 and 3 (x1 = 0, x3 = 0). Then the final division would be:\n\u2003Player 1 gets: [0, 2, 0, 5, 4]\n\u2003You (Player 2) get the remainder: [6 \u2013 0, 2 \u2013 2, 3 \u2013 0, 5 \u2013 5, 4 \u2013 4] = [6, 0, 3, 0, 0].\n\n6. Let\u2019s check our outcome:\n\u2003\u2013 Our value (Player 2):\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 6\u00d773 = 438\n\u2003\u2003Item 3: 3\u00d734 = 102\n\u2003Total = 438 + 102 = 540, which is above our outside offer of 471.\n\u2003\u2013 For Player 1, even though we don\u2019t know their precise private values, by conceding all of items 2, 4, and 5 (whose expected per\u2010unit worth is around 51), they would expect roughly:\n\u2003\u2003\u2248 2\u00d751 + 5\u00d751 + 4\u00d751 = 102 + 255 + 204 = 561.\nThis should be at least as attractive as waiting (their outside option is drawn from 1 to their total value, with an expected value roughly half their total, and discounting is minimal in round 1).\n\n7. In addition, by claiming all of our high\u2010value items (items 1 and 3) we maximize our payoff. The proposed counteroffer gives us 540 (well above our fallback) while offering P1 a bundle likely above their fallback.\n\nThus, our counteroffer is to give P1: [0, 2, 0, 5, 4]. \n\nOur response in the required JSON format is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 0, 5, 4]}",

I need to ensure this offer gives me a value greater than 882, considering Player 2 will also evaluate and potentially counter. \n   - Here's a possible division:\n     - Give Player 2: \n       - 2 units of item 1\n       - 1 unit of item 2\n       - 2 units of item 3\n       - 1 unit of item 4\n       - 1 unit of item 5\n     - Keep for myself:\n       - 5 units of item 1 = 5 * 74 = 370\n       - 2 units of item 2 = 2 * 64 = 128\n       - 3 units of item 3 = 3 * 18 = 54\n       - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 * 43 = 43\n       - 2 units of item 5 = 2 * 25 = 50\n     - Total = 370 + 128 + 54 + 43 + 50 = 645\n\nHowever, the total value falls short of the current outside offer value of 882. Therefore, this is not a suitable proposal. \n\nI need to reduce the number of items Player 2 receives and increase mine while ensuring the resulting total is both above 882 and appealing enough for Player 2 to consider.\n\nLet's adjust the offer:\n- Give Player 2:\n  - 1 unit of item 1\n  - 1 unit of item 2\n  - 1 unit of item 3\n  - 0 units of item 4\n  - 0 unit of item 5\n- Keep for myself:\n  - 6 units of item 1 = 6 * 74 = 444\n  - 2 units of item 2 = 2 * 64 = 128\n  - 4 units of item 3 = 4 * 18 = 72\n  - 2 units of item 4 = 2 * 43 = 86\n  - 3 units of item 5 = 3 * 25 = 75\n- Total Value = 444 + 128 + 72 + 86 + 75 = 805\n\nThis is still less than my outside offer of 882, showing that no reasonable division proposed within the constraints leaves a beneficial deal for me given my current values.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Each round decreases the value of the negotiation outcome slightly, suggesting that a quick resolution may retain more value for both parties.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer**: None\n- **Value of Potential Counteroffers**:\n  - We aim to ensure that our retained value is greater than the outside offer value. We need to make sure that any proposed division provides us at least 490 in value.\n\nLet's consider a balanced counteroffer that aims to maintain my interests:\n\nLet's calculate the value from keeping a proportionate share of the items:\n  - Keep 1 out of 2 units of item 1 for yourself: \\(1 \\times 36 = 36\\)\n  - Keep 2 out of 3 units of item 2 for yourself: \\(2 \\times 48 = 96\\)\n  - Keep 3 out of 5 units of item 3 for yourself: \\(3 \\times 37 = 111\\)\n  - Keep 4 out of 6 units of item 4 for yourself: \\(4 \\times 77 = 308\\)\n  - Keep 2 out of 3 units of item 5 for yourself: \\(2 \\times 25 = 50\\)\n\nTotal value of the above distribution = \\(36 + 96 + 111 + 308 + 50 = 601\\)\n\nUnder this division, I receive a total value of 601, which is greater than my outside offer of 490.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision Based on the Analysis\n\nGiven the calculations, my objective will be to propose a division that allows me to keep a higher value than my outside offer and is preferable over potentially waiting for further rounds.\n\nTherefore, I will propose offering Player 2 the remaining units as a counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 2, 2, 1]}\n\nThis offer means:\n- I offer Player 2: \n  - 1 unit of item 1\n  - 1 unit of item 2\n  - 2 units of item 3\n  - 2 units of item 4\n  - 1 unit of item 5",

                    "response": "Step\u2010by\u2010step reasoning:\n\n1. My overall maximum from receiving every unit is \n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 2\u00d780 = 160  \n\u2003\u2003Item 2: 3\u00d727 = 81  \n\u2003\u2003Item 3: 5\u00d780 = 400  \n\u2003\u2003Item 4: 6\u00d795 = 570  \n\u2003\u2003Item 5: 3\u00d774 = 222  \n\u2003\u2003Total = 1433.\n\n2. My private outside offer is 1369. This \u201creservation value\u201d is almost my full\u2010value total, leaving only 1433 \u2013 1369 = 64 \u201csurplus\u201d that I could conceivably share with Player 1 in any agreement that beats my outside option.\n\n3. The current offer from Player 1 gives me the allocation [1,1,2,2,1]. Calculating my value from that offer:\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 1\u00d780 = 80  \n\u2003\u2003Item 2: 1\u00d727 = 27  \n\u2003\u2003Item 3: 2\u00d780 = 160  \n\u2003\u2003Item 4: 2\u00d795 = 190  \n\u2003\u2003Item 5: 1\u00d774 = 74  \n\u2003\u2003Total = 80 + 27 + 160 + 190 + 74 = 531.\n\n4. Accepting 531 is far below my guaranteed outside offer of 1369. Thus, accepting is not a good option.\n\n5. As for a counteroffer: In order for me to have a deal that beats my outside option, I must secure at least 1369 in my own valuation. Given the total value available (1433), I can \u201cafford\u201d at most a sacrifice of 64 points toward Player 1. In bargaining terms, that means my counteroffer would have to almost give me all items \u2013 leaving Player 1 a very meager share (in my \u201cpoints\u201d calculation) that is likely well below what Player 1\u2019s outside offer would be (their outside offer is drawn from a wide range up to their maximum, with an expected value far higher than a token piece).\n\n6. For example, if I gave up one unit of item 2 (my lowest\u2010valued item at 27 points) my allocation would be [2,2,5,6,3] for me (value = 1433 \u2013 27 = 1406) and Player 1 would get [0,1,0,0,0]. This leaves Player 1 with an item 2 unit which is worth 27 to me and (on average) around 51 to them. Given that Player 1\u2019s own outside option is drawn from a range that could be quite high, it is unlikely they would accept receiving roughly 51 points of expected value. (And any concession bigger than 27 would reduce my share even more, so I\u2019d soon fall below my outside offer of 1369.)\n\n7. Because nearly every deal that could beat my reservation would force me to give up so much (and because Player 1 is likely not going to accept such a lopsided division, considering their own outside option), I have no acceptable counteroffer in round 1 that both beats my reservation (1369) and would be enticing enough for Player 1.\n\n8. Therefore, since the current offer is very unfavorable (531) and any counteroffer that keeps me above my outside offer leaves Player 1 with an extremely unattractive share, my best action is to secure my guaranteed outside offer.\n\nGiven the above reasoning, my action now is:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Thus, the sooner a favorable deal is reached, the better it is for maintaining value.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer**: There is no current offer on the table, as this is round 1.\n- **Formulate a Potential Counteroffer**: I aim to keep enough items to make my total value from the offer greater than my outside offer value of 628. Let's consider proposing a reasonable split that maximizes my value:\n\n#### My Valuation for Different Divisions\n\nWe will compute my valuation for different units and create a counteroffer where my total value exceeds 628. Let's propose keeping more valuable items first and check the options:\n\n1. **Keep 3 units of item 1 (111 value)**\n2. **Keep 0 units of item 2 (0 value)**\n3. **Keep 3 units of item 3 (141 value)**\n4. **Keep 2 units of item 4 (40 value)**\n5. **Keep 2 units of item 5 (104 value)**\n\nTotal value = \\(111 + 0 + 141 + 40 + 104 = 396\\)\n\nThis value is less than 628. I shouldn't accept an offer with lower value than my outside offer, so I'll try another distribution:\n\n1. **Keep 5 units of item 1 (185 value)**\n2. **Keep 0 units of item 2 (0 value)**\n3. **Keep 5 units of item 3 (235 value)**\n4. **Keep 1 units of item 4 (20 value)**\n5. **Keep 1 units of item 5 (52 value)**\n\nTotal value = \\(185 + 0 + 235 + 20 + 52 = 492\\)\n\nTo get above 628, I will adjust further:\n- I could suggest giving away:\n  - 2 units of item 1\n  - 1 unit of item 2\n  - 2 units of item 3\n  - 1 unit of item 4\n  - 2 units of item 5\n\nThat means keeping:\n- 3 units of item 1 \\((3 \\times 37 = 111)\\)\n- 0 unit of item 2 \\((0 \\times 80 = 0)\\)\n- 3 units of item 3 \\((3 \\times 47 = 141)\\)\n- 1 unit of item 4 \\((1 \\times 20 = 20)\\)\n- 1 unit of item 5 \\((1 \\times 52 = 52)\\)\n\nTotal value = \\(111 + 0 + 141 + 20 + 52 = 324\\)\n\nThis is still less than 628, so I need to be more aggressive in keeping items:\n\n- Keep 5 units of item 1 (185 value)\n- Keep 0 units of item 2 (0 value)\n- Keep 4 units of item 3 (188 value)\n- Keep 2 units of item 4 (40 value)\n- Keep 1 unit of item 5 (52 value)\n\nTotal value = \\(185 + 0 + 188 + 40 + 52 = 465\\)\n\nThis proposal still ends up less than outside offer. Adjusting further:\n\n**Propose: Propose keeping majority of higher-value items:**\n- 5 units of item 1\n- 1 unit of item 2\n- 3 units of item 3\n- 2 units of item 4\n- 2 units of item 5\n\nMy proposed counteroffer, therefore, gives:\n\n- 0 units of item 1\n- 0 units of item 2\n- 2 units of item 3\n- 0 units of item 4\n- 1 units of item 5\n\n### 3) Make a Decision Based on Analysis\n\nGiven the insights, provide the initial counteroffer aiming to maximize my value.\n\n**Action**: {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 2, 0, 1]}",

You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Step\u2010by\u2010step reasoning:\n1. The current offer on the table gives you the following allocation (units received by you): item1 = 0, item2 = 0, item3 = 2, item4 = 0, item5 = 1. With your private per\u2010unit values [75, 41, 98, 63, 13] the offer\u2019s value to you is:\n\u2003\u20030\u00d775 + 0\u00d741 + 2\u00d798 + 0\u00d763 + 1\u00d713 = 196 + 13 = 209.\n2. Your private outside offer is 652, which is much higher than 209, so accepting this offer is not attractive.\n3. In a counteroffer you propose what you \u201cgive\u201d to Player 1; the items remaining (total available for each type minus your offer) will go to you. Hence, if you propose a counteroffer [n1, n2, n3, n4, n5] (units given to Player 1), your allocation becomes:\n\u2003\u2003Item1: 5 \u2013 n1;\u2003Item2: 1 \u2013 n2;\u2003Item3: 5 \u2013 n3;\u2003Item4: 2 \u2013 n4;\u2003Item5: 3 \u2013 n5.\n4. You want your own allocation to have a value at least as high as your outside offer (652), and ideally just a bit above it so you are indifferent between your fallback and the deal.\n5. One way to \u201cengineer\u201d such a division (using your private values) is to choose your own allocation so that your total is about 652. Noting your relative per\u2010unit values, the following allocation works:\n\u2003\u2003Take 2 units of item1, all 5 units of item3, and 1 unit of item5. That gives a value of:\n\u2003\u2003\u20032\u00d775 + 5\u00d798 + 1\u00d713 = 150 + 490 + 13 = 653.\n\u2003\u2003No units from item2 and item4.\n6. Given the total available amounts, if you take (item1 = 2, item2 = 0, item3 = 5, item4 = 0, item5 = 1), then Player 1\u2019s share (which is what you are offering to them in your counteroffer) becomes:\n\u2003\u2003Item1: 5 \u2013 2 = 3\n\u2003\u2003Item2: 1 \u2013 0 = 1\n\u2003\u2003Item3: 5 \u2013 5 = 0\n\u2003\u2003Item4: 2 \u2013 0 = 2\n\u2003\u2003Item5: 3 \u2013 1 = 2\n7. Thus, a valid counteroffer to propose is that you give Player 1 [3, 1, 0, 2, 2]. Under this counteroffer you secure 653 in value (which is slightly above your fallback of 652) and leave the remaining items for yourself.\n8. Since accepting the current offer gives you only 209, and you can get at least 652 by walking away, you prefer a counteroffer that might lead to an agreement providing you at least your reservation value.\n9. (Note: Although Player 1\u2019s preferences are unknown, this counteroffer is designed to minimally concede while still obtaining nearly your reservation value.)\n\nThus, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3,1,0,2,2]}",

This incentivizes reaching an agreement sooner rather than later, as the value of potential future agreements diminishes.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n   - **Current Offer:** None, as this is the initial offer of round 1.\n   - **Potential Counteroffers:**\n     - Given the total units and my valuations per unit, I aim to construct offers that provide me with total value greater than 713, my outside offer value.\n     - Some possible divisions can be considered:\n       - Keeping all high-value units (e.g., items 1, 4, 5) or a mix that maximizes total value.\n\n3) **Make a Decision:**\n   - My goal is to propose a counteroffer that allows me to retain a value significantly greater than 713. \n\n   - Let's consider keeping:\n     - 1 unit of item 1 (66)\n     - 1 unit of item 2 (53)\n     - 3 units of item 3 (93)\n     - 3 units of item 4 (282)\n     - 1 unit of item 5 (76)\n\n   This gives me:\n   - Total Value for me = 66 (item 1) + 53 (item 2) + 93 (item 3) + 282 (item 4) + 76 (item 5) = 570\n\n   The division I give to Player 2 would be:\n   - 0 unit of item 1\n   - 2 units of item 2\n   - 3 units of item 3\n   - 0 units of item 4\n   - 2 units of item 5\n   \n   - This would still need optimization to give me a value above my fallback offer of 713, so I'll reconsider and go for a more suitable configuration.\n   \n   However, the division provided earlier seems mistaken as it yields a value spread I need to balance further to beat the 713 mark. I must optimize in keeping more value or units from stronger item evaluations like item 4, and fewer units from lesser valuable evaluations, such as item 3.\n\n#### Corrective Action:\nAnalyzing the units kept or offered to improve my position:\n\n   Try this distribution:\n   - Keeping:\n     - 1 unit of item 1 (66)\n     - 3 units of item 2 (159)\n     - 3 units of item 3 (93)\n     - 0 units of item 4 \n     - 1 unit of item 5 (76)\n   \n   - New value computation:\n     66 + 159 + 93 + 0 + 76 = 394\n   \nThough this total doesn\u2019t exceed 713, negotiations drive exploration about what Player 2 valuation might hold worth further. \n\nIn ultimate effort for optimization in bridge gap difficulty beyond round adjustments, consider alternative offerings strategy. Therefore, initialize engagement with Player 2 harmonically; I\u2019ll make a set up initiative setting.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 3, 3, 2]}",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "To approach this negotiation systematically, let's go through the step-by-step questions and analysis.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n- **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 1002. This is what I will receive if I choose to walk away from the negotiation.\n  \n- **Values of the Items:**\n  - Item 1: 91 per unit\n  - Item 2: 86 per unit\n  - Item 3: 37 per unit\n  - Item 4: 49 per unit\n  - Item 5: 26 per unit\n\n- **Total Pool of Items:**\n  - 9 units of item 1\n  - 4 units of item 2\n  - 3 units of item 3\n  - 5 units of item 4\n  - 1 unit of item 5\n\n- **Discount Factor:** The discount factor is 0.98. This means that values will slightly decrease each round due to the discount factor (gamma^r-1). It's important to consider this when deciding between delaying or accepting an offer. \n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n- **Current Offer:** There is no current offer on the table, so I will need to propose an initial offer.\n\n- **Potential Counteroffers:**\n  - Since it is round 1, and I want to make an offer that is beneficial, I need to calculate potential divisions that are greater than my outside offer of 1002.\n  - For example, consider the following potential division where I retain most of the high-value items while offering the remaining to Player 2:\n    - Offer Player 2: [3, 1, 2, 3, 0]\n    - Keep for myself: [6, 3, 1, 2, 1]\n    - Calculate my value:\n      - 6 units of item 1 = 6 \u00d7 91 = 546\n      - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258\n      - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 37 = 37\n      - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 49 = 98\n      - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 26 = 26\n      - **Total value** = 965\n      - This is slightly below my outside offer (1002). Therefore, this offer isn't good enough.\n\n  - After recalculating, a possible offer where my value exceeds 1002 should be:\n    - Offer Player 2: [4, 1, 2, 3, 0]\n    - Keep for myself: [5, 3, 1, 2, 1]\n    - Calculate my value:\n      - 5 units of item 1 = 5 \u00d7 91 = 455\n      - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258\n      - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 37 = 37\n      - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 49 = 98\n      - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 26 = 26\n      - **Total value** = 874\n  - Still not exceeding my outside offer, I should adjust again.\n\n  - An alternative offer:\n    - Offer Player 2: [3, 1, 2, 2, 0]\n    - Keep for myself: [6, 3, 1, 3, 1]\n    - My value would be:\n      - 6 units of item 1 = 6 \u00d7 91 = 546\n      - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258\n      - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 37 = 37\n      - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147\n      - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 26 = 26\n      - **Total value** = 1014\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\nSince walking away is not preferable unless I have an offer for myself that is less than my outside offer of 1002, I should make an initial counteroffer that provides me with a value of 1014, which is slightly better than my outside offer.\n\nTherefore, my action is to propose a counteroffer with the division:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 1, 2, 2, 0]}\n```\n\nThis counteroffer should ensure that I do not make critical negotiation mistakes, and it strategically positions me to potentially improve my outcome above my outside offer value.",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 337. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 801 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To make an informed decision, let's walk through the step-by-step questions:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is **337**.\n   - My values per unit for each type of item are:\n     - Item 1: 37\n     - Item 2: 69\n     - Item 3: 92\n     - Item 4: 63\n     - Item 5: 6\n   - Total pool of items:\n     - 5 units of Item 1, 1 unit of Item 2, 1 unit of Item 3, 4 units of Item 4, 3 units of Item 5.\n   - The discount factor (gamma) is 0.98, which means the present value of any negotiated outcome decreases slightly each round. However, since we have no current offer and this is round 1, this factor doesn't immediately impact us, except in future actions.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer: None. Thus, we need to make the first offer.\n   - To decide on a counteroffer, I need to propose a division that maximizes my value while considering my outside offer. \n   - I will consider various divisions and their values:\n     - If I keep all units, my total value is the sum of all item values:\n       \\( \\text{Total Value} = 5 \\times 37 + 1 \\times 69 + 1 \\times 92 + 4 \\times 63 + 3 \\times 6 = 616 \\)\n     - To maximize my position, I need to offer less value to Player 2 than what I keep:\n\n   \\[\n   \\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|}\n   \\hline\n   \\text{Item} & \\text{Units I Keep} & \\text{Value of Units I Keep} & \\text{Units I Offer} & \\text{Value of Units I Offer} \\\\\n   \\hline\n   1 & 3 & 111 & 2 & 74 \\\\\n   2 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 69 \\\\\n   3 & 1 & 92 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n   4 & 3 & 189 & 1 & 63 \\\\\n   5 & 1 & 6 & 2 & 12 \\\\\n   \\hline\n   \\end{array}\n   \\]\n\n   - Total value of what I keep: \\( 111 + 0 + 92 + 189 + 6 = 398 \\)\n   - Total value of what I offer: \\( 74 + 69 + 0 + 63 + 12 = 218 \\)\n\n   - Keeping the value of my private offer (337) in mind, the counteroffer outlined above provides me with a value of 398. This is better than my own outside offer of 337.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince I don't have any current offer, I cannot accept anything at this point. Walking away would ensure a value of 337, but I can potentially secure a better outcome with negotiation. Thus, I'll propose a counteroffer that ensures I keep a significant portion of my value while providing a reasonable offer to Player 2:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 0, 1, 2]} \n\nThis counteroffer maximizes my value above my outside offer and provides a fair starting point for negotiations.",

Your share will be whatever is left after handing over the units in your counteroffer. Your total available items are [5, 2, 4, 2, 6].\n\nYour private values are very different across items. In particular:\n\u2003\u2022 Item 1 is very valuable (97 per unit)\u2013you want to keep all 5.\n\u2003\u2022 Item 3 is also important (75 per unit)\u2013keep all 4.\nClinch items that you value less to entice Player 1. You value item 2 at 42 per unit, item 4 at 28 per unit, and item 5 at 37 per unit. Conceding those in full or in part gives you a moderate loss (smaller than what you\u2019d lose by giving up on high\u2010value item 1 or 3) and may help Player 1 get enough \u201cvalue\u201d to beat their unknown outside offer.\nOne possibility is to concede both units of item 2, as well as all of item 4 (2 units) and item 5 (6 units). Then your counteroffer (what you offer to Player 1) would be:\n\u2003\u2003Item1: 0\u2003\u2003Item2: 2\u2003\u2003Item3: 0\u2003\u2003Item4: 2\u2003\u2003Item5: 6.\nUnder that offer, your remaining allocation becomes:\n\u2003\u2003Item1: 5\u2003\u2003Item2: 0\u2003\u2003Item3: 4\u2003\u2003Item4: 0\u2003\u2003Item5: 0.\nYour value then is:\n\u2003\u20035\u00d797 (485) + 4\u00d775 (300) = 785,\nwhich is comfortably above your reservation value of 633.\nPlayer 1\u2019s share, from an \u201caverage\u201d perspective (if their per\u2010unit private values are roughly on the order of the midpoint of [1,101] \u2013 say about 51), would be approximately:\n\u2003\u2003Item2: 2\u00d751 = 102,\n\u2003\u2003Item4: 2\u00d751 = 102,\n\u2003\u2003Item5: 6\u00d751 = 306,\ntotaling about 510.\nThis should be attractive enough relative to their uncertain outside offer (which is drawn uniformly from 1 up to their total possible value) while allowing you to secure a high value deal.\n\nStep 3: Decide the action.\nSince accepting [0,1,3,0,0] yields only 267 (far below 633) and walking would give you 633, you are better off counteroffering. You propose the counteroffer that gives Player 1: [0,2,0,2,6] (and leaves you with [5,0,4,0,0]) for a total utility of 785 for you.\n\nThus, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0,2,0,2,6]}",

Since we're in round 2, any end-of-negotiation payoff will be multiplied by \\(0.98^{1} = 0.98\\).\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer (Player 2 offers me [0, 2, 0, 2, 6]):**\n  - Item 1: 0 units \u00d7 66 = 0\n  - Item 2: 2 units \u00d7 60 = 120\n  - Item 3: 0 units \u00d7 11 = 0\n  - Item 4: 2 units \u00d7 42 = 84\n  - Item 5: 6 units \u00d7 89 = 534\n  - Total value of current offer = 738\n  - Adjusted for discount: \\(738 \\times 0.98 = 723.24\\)\n\n- **Assess against Outside Offer:**\n  My outside offer is 915, which is greater than the discounted value of the current offer (723.24).\n\n- **Mistakes to Avoid:**\n  - Accepting an offer worse than my outside offer would be a mistake.\n  - Walking away from a better offer than my outside offer would also be a mistake.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\n- **Should I Accept?:** No, because 723.24 (current offer's value) is less than 915 (my outside offer).\n- **Should I Walk?:** This might be a viable option since the current offer is worse than my outside offer, but first, let's consider a counteroffer.\n- **Propose a Counteroffer:** I should aim for an allocation where my total adjusted value exceeds 915 while still leaving a feasible portion to Player 2.\n\nGiven the item values to me, I should focus on items where I have high value per unit. Therefore, I'll adjust the offer to something more favorable:\n\n**Proposed Counteroffer: [3, 0, 2, 0, 3]**\n- Total Value:\n  - Item 1: 2 units \u00d7 66 = 132\n  - Item 2: 0 units \u00d7 60 = 0\n  - Item 3: 2 units \u00d7 11 = 22\n  - Item 4: 0 units \u00d7 42 = 0\n  - Item 5: 3 units \u00d7 89 = 267\n  - Total = 421\n  - My share:\n    - Item 1: 3 units \u00d7 66 = 198\n    - Item 2: 2 units \u00d7 60 = 120\n    - Item 3: 2 units \u00d7 11 = 22\n    - Item 4: 2 units \u00d7 42 = 84\n    - Item 5: 3 units \u00d7 89 = 267\n    - Total, adjusted for discount: \\(691 \\times 0.98 = 677.18\\)\n\nThis proposed allocation yields a total value to me that exceeds the adjusted value of the offer Player 2 made, but does not quite exceed my outside offer. \n\nMoving forward:\nConsidering my outside offer is already high and with remaining rounds for negotiation, I will take the safe route and avoid any mistakes by opting to take the outside offer.\n\nTherefore, my action will be to **WALK** away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

                    "response": "Analysis:\nMy private per\u2010unit values are: item1=25, item2=82, item3=29, item4=48, item5=80. The totals available are: 3, 6, 2, 2, and 4 respectively. My total value for getting everything is 1041. My outside offer is 879, so if negotiations break down I receive 879. \n\nCurrently, Player\u20051\u2019s round\u20111 offer gives me [1, 3, 0, 1, 2]. That would give me a payoff of\n\u2003\u200325\u00d71 + 82\u00d73 + 29\u00d70 + 48\u00d71 + 80\u00d72 = 25 + 246 + 0 + 48 + 160 = 479,\nwith no discount (round 1, factor 1). This is much lower than my reservation of 879.\n\nI could try to make a counteroffer. In our negotiation the counteroffer is given as what I \u201cgive\u201d to Player\u20051 so that my share is the complement. In order for me to be at least as well off as my outside offer, the items I \u201cgive\u201d must have a total value (by my private values) of at most 1041 \u2013 879 = 162. In principle I would like to propose a division that lets me obtain at least 879 in my own value while \u201cpaying\u201d Player\u20051 an attractive bundle. \nHowever, since I only \u201close\u201d utility by giving away goods I highly value, I\u2019d want to concede \u201ccheap\u201d items. My lowest\u2010value items are item\u20051 (worth 25 per unit) and item\u20053 (worth 29 per unit). But note that even if I concede all of item\u20051 (3 units, 75 in value) and item\u20053 (2 units, 58) for a total \u201ccost\u201d of 133, my share would be worth 1041 \u2013 133 = 908, barely above my reservation. Yet from Player\u20051\u2019s likely perspective (their private values are drawn uniformly from 1 to 101, with a mean around 51 per unit) the bundle of 5 low\u2011value items may be expected to be worth only about 5\u00d751 = 255. In contrast, the approximate expected value of their outside offer may be on the higher side (since their total \u201cpie\u201d is roughly 867 in expectation and their outside offer is drawn uniformly from [1, total], its mean is roughly (total+1)/2 \u2248 434). \n\nSo even if I try to \u201csqueeze\u201d nearly all surplus by giving away very little by my measure, the resulting offer to Player\u20051 would be unattractive relative to what they might get by walking. Any attempt to make the division acceptable to them (by giving them more) would force me below my reservation value. \n\nThus, my options are:\n\u2022 Accepting the current offer gives me 479, which is far lower than my outside offer (879).\n\u2022 Proposing any counteroffer that secures me at least 879 (by giving away no more than 162 in my own value) would yield a bundle for Player\u20051 that is very likely below what they would obtain by taking their outside offer.\n\u2022 Waiting further (or counteroffering) risks discounting and may lead to no deal.\n\nSince my best guarantee is my outside offer of 879 and the current offer (and any \u201creasonable\u201d counteroffer from my side) is unlikely to be accepted by Player\u20051, the rational move now is to WALK away.\n\nTherefore, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

(Thus if I got everything I\u2019d have a total value of 1537.) In the current offer, Player\u00a01 is offering me [1, 3, 2, 1, 0]. That would give me:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a01: 1\u00d762 = 62  \n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a02: 3\u00d753 = 159  \n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a03: 2\u00d748 = 96  \n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a04: 1\u00d749 = 49  \n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a05: 0\u00d763 = 0  \nFor a total of 62+159+96+49 = 366. Since the discount factor in round\u00a01 is 0.98^(0)=1, my discounted deal\u2010value would be 366.\n\nStep 2: My outside option is 1311. That means if I \u201cWALK\u201d the negotiation ends with me getting 1311. Because 1311 is much higher than 366, accepting the current offer is clearly unattractive.\n\nStep 3: As Player\u00a02, if I try to counteroffer I must \u201cleave on the table\u201d a concession such that my own resulting bundle\u2019s value (by my private numbers) is at least 1311. Since the maximum total value (if I got all items) is 1537, I could only concede items whose total value (by my metrics) is at most 1537 \u2013 1311 = 226. (All counteroffers must offer an allocation to Player\u00a01 such that the quantities given to Player\u00a01 plus what I keep equal the available totals.) Even if I try to \u201cdesign\u201d a counteroffer by giving away the items I care least about, the best I could do is \u201csqueeze\u201d 226 in my value. In many cases the items I value little might be very valuable to Player\u00a01. Yet typical expectation (given random draws over [1,101]) is that Player\u00a01\u2019s outside offer should be fairly high (on average well over 200 in value terms on their own scale). Thus, it is unlikely that a counteroffer where I exactly \u201cprotect\u201d myself (receiving at least 1311 in my valuation) would be attractive to Player\u00a01.\n\nStep 4: Delaying agreement comes at a cost (discounting) and risks a breakdown if Player\u00a01\u2019s unknown private numbers (and outside offer) lead them to reject our split. Since my reservation\u2014the safe 1311 I can \u201cwalk away\u201d with\u2014is so high compared to the current proposed deal, any counteroffer attempting to secure nearly all of the items (to reach at least 1311) will almost certainly be rejected by Player\u00a01.\n\nStep 5: Given that (a) the current offer gives me only 366, (b) any counteroffer that would \u201cprotect\u201d my interests (keeping at least 1311 in my own value terms) leaves little room for making it attractive from Player\u00a01\u2019s perspective, and (c) my outside offer is a secure 1311, it is best for me to \u201cWALK\u201d away from the negotiations now.\n\nThus, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 930. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 786 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To analyze the current situation:\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 930.\n   - The values of the items involved according to my private valuations are:\n     - Item 1: 28 (0 units available, so this is not part of the negotiation)\n     - Item 2: 20\n     - Item 3: 71\n     - Item 4: 78\n     - Item 5: 65\n   - The total pool of items consists of 6 units of item 2, 8 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 5 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor (gamma) is 0.98. This affects the decision in terms of the value of offers across multiple rounds. If I delay accepting or proposing an optimal offer, the value could diminish.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - There is no current offer on the table.\n   - To maximize my total value, I need to propose a distribution of the available items such that my total value from them, calculated using my private values, exceeds my outside offer value of 930.\n\n   Let's calculate the maximum value I can get from these items:\n   - Total value of all items if I keep them all:\n     - Item 2: 6 units * 20 = 120\n     - Item 3: 8 units * 71 = 568\n     - Item 4: 3 units * 78 = 234\n     - Item 5: 5 units * 65 = 325\n     - Total = 120 + 568 + 234 + 325 = 1247\n\n   - To get a total value greater than 930, I need to ensure that the items I keep are worth more than 930 units in value. Let me calculate a potential split.\n\n   Suppose I propose:\n   - 2 units of item 2 to Player 2, keeping 4.\n   - 3 units of item 3 to Player 2, keeping 5.\n   - 1 unit of item 4 to Player 2, keeping 2.\n   - 2 units of item 5 to Player 2, keeping 3.\n\n   Value for me:\n   - Item 2: 4 units * 20 = 80\n   - Item 3: 5 units * 71 = 355\n   - Item 4: 2 units * 78 = 156\n   - Item 5: 3 units * 65 = 195\n   - Total = 80 + 355 + 156 + 195 = 786\n   \n   As the total is still less than 930, I cannot accept this offer.\n\nAnother potential split to try:\n   - 2 units of item 2 to Player 2, keeping 4.\n   - 2 units of item 3 to Player 2, keeping 6.\n   - 1 units of item 4 to Player 2, keeping 2.\n   - 2 units of item 5 to Player 2, keeping 3.\n\n   Value for me:\n   - Item 2: 4 units * 20 = 80\n   - Item 3: 6 units * 71 = 426\n   - Item 4: 2 units * 78 = 156\n   - Item 5: 3 units * 65 = 195\n   - Total = 80 + 426 + 156 + 195 = 857\n\nUnfortunately, this is still less than 930. Let's readjust my proposal. \n\nConsidering that my limit is 930, a more contrasting allocation will be required:\n\nReevaluated proposal:\n   - 0 units of item 2 to Player 2, keeping 6.\n   - 5 units of item 3 to Player 2, keeping 3.\n   - 1 units of item 4 to Player 2, keeping 2.\n   - 0 units of item 5 to Player 2, keeping 5.\n\n   Value for me:\n   - Item 2: 6 units * 20 = 120\n   - Item 3: 3 units * 71 = 213\n   - Item 4: 2 units * 78 = 156\n   - Item 5: 5 units * 65 = 325\n   - Total = 120 + 213 + 156 + 325 = 814\n\nIt's clear that the preferred configuration yielding a total greater than 930 very depends on keeping significant portions of the higher-valued items. Propose  \n   - 0 units of item 2 to Player 2, keeping 6.\n   - 2 units of item 3 to Player 2, keeping 6.\n   - 1 units of item 4 to Player 2, keeping 2.\n   - 1 units of item 5 to Player 2, keeping 4.\n\n Value for me:\n   - Item 2: 6 units * 20 = 120\n   - Item 3: 6 units * 71 = 426\n   - Item 4: 2 units * 78 = 156\n   - Item 5: 4 units * 65 = 260\n   - Total = 120 + 426 + 156 + 260 = 962\n\nThis allocation provides me with a value greater than 930 and can be my first proposed action.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - Since there is no current offer on the table and my initial proposal calculates a value over my outside offer, I will propose this allocation as a COUNTEROFFER.\n   \n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 1, 1]}",

It is clearly not worth accepting.\n\n2. Since our reservation (the outside offer) is 582, we need to secure a deal that gives us at least that much value. Looking at our items and their values, we see that items 1 and 4 are particularly \u201clucrative\u201d for us (6 units of item 1 gives 6\u00d741 = 246; 8 units of item 4 gives 8\u00d745 = 360; total 246+360 = 606). If we keep these full quantities, we guarantee ourselves 606\u2014comfortably above our reservation value.\n\n3.

Specifically, if it concludes in round 2, the present value is multiplied by gamma^1 (0.98).\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer: None.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - I should make a counteroffer since there is no current offer. Let's aim for a division that maximizes my total value while attempting to make a reasonable offer to Player 2.\n\nSince my outside offer is 276, I should aim for a division of items that gives me at least that value, considering potential discounting in future rounds. I need to ensure my offer to Player 2 does not lead to my total being less than my outside offer of 276.\n\nI will propose the following counteroffer, estimating I can retain the majority of high-value items while offering Player 2 a fair share:\n\n- Offering Player 2:\n  - 3 units of item 1 (keeping 2 for myself, giving Player 2 a value of 54 if their value per unit is like mine).\n  - 3 units of item 2 (keeping 2, giving Player 2 a value of 45).\n  - 1 unit of item 3 (keeping 1, giving Player 2 roughly half the value if their value is like mine).\n  - 1 unit of item 4 (keeping 2, splitting the value if their value is like mine).\n  - 0 units of item 5 (keeping all).\n\nThis proposed division leaves Player 2 with possibly fair values, depending on their valuation, and ensures my total value from the retained items is 273, which is close to my outside offer, considering discount:\n\n2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 18 = 36  \n2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 15 = 30  \n1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 41 = 41  \n2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 46 = 92  \n2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 70 = 140  \n\nTotal value = 36 + 30 + 41 + 92 + 140 = 339  \n\n339 is greater than my outside offer of 276, so it's a favorable division after one round of negotiation even when considering the discount factor.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 3, 1, 1, 0]}\n```",

Since the negotiation is currently in round 1 (discount factor \u03b3^(0) = 1), accepting yields 349, clearly better than our fallback.\n\nStep 3: Consider the risks of a counteroffer. Counteroffering might allow us to try to capture some of item 5, which we highly value. However, without knowing Player 1\u2019s private values, any counteroffer risks prolonging the negotiation and incurring a discount (\u03b3 = 0.98 in later rounds) or even a breakdown of negotiations. Additionally, the current offer already yields a strong payoff.\n\nStep 4: Conclusion.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To determine the appropriate action, let's systematically address the provided questions:\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 594.\n   - Values of the items involved, from my perspective, are:\n     - Item 1: 93 per unit\n     - Item 2: 38 per unit\n     - Item 3: 89 per unit\n     - Item 4: 27 per unit\n     - Item 5: 45 per unit\n   - The total pool of items:\n     - 2 units of item 1\n     - 1 unit of item 2\n     - 6 units of item 3\n     - 3 units of item 4\n     - 4 units of item 5\n   - The discount factor (gamma = 0.98) slightly reduces the value of the negotiation outcome if it is delayed to future rounds. Therefore, it's generally better for both players to agree quickly if possible, but not at the expense of accepting worse deals than the outside offer.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - There's no current offer on the table.\n   - As Player 1, I should propose a counteroffer that maximizes my value while being better than Player 2's outside offer (though I don't know their outside offer, it would likely require some concessions from my side).\n   - I need to ensure my proposed division gives me a total value greater than my outside offer (594).\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - Determine a counteroffer:\n     - Let's evaluate different potential allocations to make a counteroffer that maximizes my value, ensuring it's better than my outside offer.\n     - I aim for a division where my share has over 594 in value.\n     - Consider a strategy where I concede items with lower value to me but potentially higher value to Player 2. However, I must still ensure my share's value is high enough.\n\nFor example, consider a distribution where I retain:\n   - 2 units of item 1 (2 * 93 = 186)\n   - 1 unit of item 2 (1 * 38 = 38)\n   - 4 units of item 3 (4 * 89 = 356)\n   - 0 units of item 4 (0 * 27 = 0)\n   - 0 units of item 5 (0 * 45 = 0)\n\nTotal value of my share = 186 + 38 + 356 = 580. This is slightly less than my outside offer, so I need to increase it.\n\nLet's try:\n   - 1 unit of item 1 (1 * 93 = 93)\n   - 1 unit of item 2 (1 * 38 = 38)\n   - 3 units of item 3 (3 * 89 = 267)\n   - 0 units of item 4 (0 * 27 = 0)\n   - 4 units of item 5 (4 * 45 = 180)\n\nTotal value = 93 + 38 + 267 + 180 = 578. Again, this is lower than my outside offer.\n\nLet's adjust further:\n   - 1 unit of item 1 (1 * 93 = 93)\n   - 0 units of item 2 (0 * 38 = 0)\n   - 5 units of item 3 (5 * 89 = 445)\n   - 0 units of item 4 (0 * 27 = 0)\n   - 1 unit of item 5 (1 * 45 = 45)\n\nTotal value = 93 + 445 + 45 = 583, still slightly less. Let's revise one more time:\n\n   - 1 unit of item 1 (1 * 93 = 93)\n   - 0 units of item 2 (0 * 38 = 0)\n   - 6 units of item 3 (6 * 89 = 534)\n   - 0 units of item 4 (0 * 27 = 0)\n   - 0 units of item 5 (0 * 45 = 0)\n\nTotal value = 627, which is more than my outside offer.\n\nTherefore, I will offer Player 2 all units of items 2, 4, and 5, but I keep all of item 3 and most of item 1. This way, my value is maximized and greater than my outside option.\n\nHere is my counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 3, 4]}",

                    "response": "I'll explain my thought process first.\n\nStep 1. Current offer analysis:\n\u2022\u2003Player 1\u2019s Round 1 offer gives you [1, 1, 0, 3, 4]. With your private per\u2010unit values (52 for item 1, 18 for item 2, 49 for item 3, 77 for item 4, 44 for item 5), that deal gives you a value of: \n\u2003\u20031\u00d752 + 1\u00d718 + 0\u00d749 + 3\u00d777 + 4\u00d744 = 52 + 18 + 0 + 231 + 176 = 477.\n\u2022\u2003Your outside option is 524, so accepting the current deal is worse than simply \u201cwalking away\u201d and taking your outside offer.\n\nStep 2. Designing a counteroffer:\nSince you can improve by continuing negotiations, you want to propose a division that gives you a present\u2010value above 524. At the same time you want to offer Player 1 enough so that they might be willing to accept rather than risk a future round.\n\nOne idea is to try to \u201csteal\u201d the items that are most valuable for you. You highly value item 4 (77 per unit) and item 5 (44 per unit). In the current offer you already get all of item 4 and item 5; however, you are missing on item 1 (52 per unit) and item 2 (18 per unit) that would add extra value. \n\nA striking option is to propose to give Player 1 all of item 3 (6 units) while you take the remainder. Under the total items available (item 1:2, item 2:1, item 3:6, item 4:3, item 5:4) this counteroffer is interpreted as \u201cI (Player 2) propose to give you [0, 0, 6, 0, 0].\u201d Then the implied division is:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Your (P2) share = Total \u2013 Offer = [2 \u2013 0, 1 \u2013 0, 6 \u2013 6, 3 \u2013 0, 4 \u2013 0] = [2, 1, 0, 3, 4].\nYour value for that allocation is:\n\u2003\u20032\u00d752 + 1\u00d718 + 0\u00d749 + 3\u00d777 + 4\u00d744 = 104 + 18 + 0 + 231 + 176 = 529.\nThis is just over your outside offer of 524.\nFor Player 1, they would receive everything in item 3. Given that in their own initial offer they ceded item 3 entirely, this might be attractive if they have a high private value for that item.\n\nStep 3. Conclusion:\nSince the current offer gives you 477 (which is inferior to 524) and this counteroffer gives you 529 (while potentially offering Player 1 what they value in item 3), it is beneficial for you to respond with a counteroffer.\n\nThus, my response is as follows:\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 6, 0, 0]}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 135. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 441 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Let's work through this step-by-step as instructed.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the current situation\n- **What is my outside offer value?**\n  - My outside offer value is 135.\n\n- **What are the values of the items involved?**\n  - My private values per unit of each item type are:\n    - Item 1: 42\n    - Item 2: 24\n    - Item 3: 9\n    - Item 4: 44\n    - Item 5: 28\n\n- **What is the total pool of items?**\n  - Total units available are:\n    - Item 1: 2 units\n    - Item 2: 4 units\n    - Item 3: 3 units\n    - Item 4: 4 units\n    - Item 5: 5 units\n\n- **How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?**\n  - The discount factor gamma is 0.98. This means that the value of any agreement reached in later rounds will be discounted. The value for an agreement reached in round 2 will be multiplied by 0.98, and for round 3 by 0.98\u00b2. This incentivizes reaching an agreement sooner rather than later to avoid loss of value.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the value of offers\n- **For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?**\n  - There is no current offer to evaluate.\n\n- **For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?**\n  - Let's consider a simple initial offer that maintains my utility above my outside offer value:\n    - Offer Player 2: 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5.\n    - This leaves me:\n      - Item 1: 1 unit = 1 \u00d7 42 = 42\n      - Item 2: 2 units = 2 \u00d7 24 = 48\n      - Item 3: 2 units = 2 \u00d7 9 = 18\n      - Item 4: 2 units = 2 \u00d7 44 = 88\n      - Item 5: 2 units = 2 \u00d7 28 = 56\n    - Total value = 42 + 48 + 18 + 88 + 56 = 252\n\n- **How do these values compare to my outside offer value?**\n  - The total value of 252 is significantly higher than my outside offer value of 135, making it an appealing candidate for a counteroffer.\n\n### Step 3: Make a decision based on the analysis\n- Since there is no current offer, I cannot choose \"ACCEPT.\"\n- I will not \"WALK\" since my potential counteroffer value (252) is higher than my outside offer (135) and we are only in round 1.\n- I should make a \"COUNTEROFFER\" since it exceeds my outside offer value, and ensure it does not make the mistakes outlined.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 1, 2, 3]}\n```",

This means there is no discount yet (\u03b3^(0)=1). Our outside offer is 312, which is significantly lower than 553. So even without any further negotiation our current offer is very favorable relative to walking away.\n\nStep 3: Although we might try to negotiate for a bit more, a counteroffer would shift the deal into a later round and incur a discount (\u03b3 = 0.98 per additional round), and it runs the risk that Player\u00a01 may not accept our counteroffer. Given that the current offer already secures a high value (553) that is comfortably above our outside option, the risk of delaying (or jeopardizing the deal) is not worth a slight possible gain.\n\nStep 4: Considering that accepting immediately ensures high value (without discount) and avoids unnecessary risk, the best course of action is to ACCEPT this offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",
