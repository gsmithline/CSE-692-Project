Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 508. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 508. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 600 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To decide on the best action, let's break down the analysis step by step.\n\n### 1) Analyze the Current Situation:\n\n- **Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer value is 508.\n- **Values of Items for Me**:\n  - Item 1: 3\n  - Item 2: 14\n  - Item 3: 74\n  - Item 4: 72\n  - Item 5: 37\n- **Total Pool of Items**:\n  - Item 1: 1 unit\n  - Item 2: 1 unit\n  - Item 3: 7 units\n  - Item 4: 4 units\n  - Item 5: 1 unit\n\nThe value of the entire pool for me is calculated as follows:\n- \\(1 \\times 3 = 3\\) for item 1\n- \\(1 \\times 14 = 14\\) for item 2\n- \\(7 \\times 74 = 518\\) for item 3\n- \\(4 \\times 72 = 288\\) for item 4\n- \\(1 \\times 37 = 37\\) for item 5\n\n**Total value of all items for me**: \\(3 + 14 + 518 + 288 + 37 = 860\\)\n\n- **Discount Factor Influence**: The discount factor, gamma, reduces the value of the negotiation outcome by multiplying it by \\(0.98^{(r-1)}\\). Since it's round 1, the discount factor is \\(0.98^0 = 1\\), so there's no discount at this round.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n\n- **Current Offer**: No offer currently on the table.\n  \n- **Potential Counteroffers**: Let's evaluate a few possible scenarios for a counteroffer:\n\n  1. **Division [0, 0, 3, 2, 0]** (keeping the remaining for me):\n      - My share if I keep: 1 item 1, 1 item 2, 4 items 3, 2 items 4, 1 item 5.\n      - My value: \n        - \\((1 \\times 3) + (1 \\times 14) + (4 \\times 74) + (2 \\times 72) + (1 \\times 37)\\)\n        - \\(3 + 14 + 296 + 144 + 37 = 494\\)\n\n  2. **Division [0, 0, 2, 1, 0]** (keeping the remaining for me):\n      - My share if I keep: 1 item 1, 1 item 2, 5 items 3, 3 items 4, 1 item 5.\n      - My value: \n        - \\((1 \\times 3) + (1 \\times 14) + (5 \\times 74) + (3 \\times 72) + (1 \\times 37)\\)\n        - \\(3 + 14 + 370 + 216 + 37 = 640\\)\n\nBoth potential counteroffers above result in different values; only the second exceeds my outside offer.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision:\n\nConsidering the first round and possible advantages later, the prime objective is to offer something better than my fallback option while maintaining value above my outside offer. Therefore, I should propose a beneficial division that keeps value above 508 for myself yet is attractive for Player 2.\n\n- **Proposed Counteroffer Division [0, 0, 2, 1, 0]**:\n  - Offering Player 2: 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 0 units of item 5.\n  - Total value for me: 640, which is above my fallback option of 508.\n\nThe division [0, 0, 2, 1, 0] ensures that I do not make mistake 2 or mistake 5, as I secure a value above my outside offer.\n\n**Final Decision**:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 2, 1, 0]}\n```",

My outside option is 129, so this deal is already much better than walking away.\n\nStep 2: Consider whether a counteroffer might improve my outcome. In these negotiations I have the opportunity to try to claim a slightly larger share. However, I must remember that:\n\u2003\u2022 Any counteroffer must be acceptable to Player 1, who originally proposed a division where they obtain the complementary split ([1, 1, 5, 3, 1]). \n\u2003\u2022 Being too greedy might cause Player 1 to reject and prolong negotiations (or even end in a WALK), and the discount factor (\u03b3 = 0.98 per round) means any delay may cost me value.\n\u2003\u2022 The current offer already gives me a clear surplus above my outside option.\n\nStep 3: Weighing the risk\u2013reward trade\u2010off. Although it is tempting to try to shift the division slightly (for example, increasing my share of high\u2010value items such as item 3 or item 4), lacking information about Player 1\u2019s private values makes it risky. If my counteroffer is too aggressive, Player 1 may reject it\u2014and in subsequent rounds the discounted value and negotiation uncertainty could lead to a less favorable outcome. \n\nStep 4: Decision. Given that:\n\u2003\u2022 The current offer yields a high undiscounted value of 248 (well above my outside offer of 129).\n\u2003\u2022 It avoids the risk and potential loss associated with making a counteroffer.\n\u2003\u2022 It preserves value by closing the negotiation in Round 1 (there is no discount here),\nthe best risk\u2010adjusted action is to ACCEPT the current offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

(Remember: if I WALK I get 713 for sure.) \n\nA rational Player\u00a02 will therefore not ACCEPT this offer. At the same time I would prefer to settle now rather than risk delay (and the discounting in later rounds). To get a deal I have to \u201cclaim\u201d a share of the pie that gives me at least 713 (and ideally a bit more so I\u2019m strictly better than my disagreement payoff). At the same time \u2013 since neither player\u2019s valuation is common knowledge \u2013 it is wise not to be overly \u201cgreedy\u201d in the counteroffer. A classic idea in these negotiation problems is to \u201csplit the difference\u201d of the total available value (here 1776) fairly, rather than accept a highly unbalanced division. \n\nA natural, \u201cfair\u2010splitting\u201d way is to attempt a near 50\u201350 split of the items. (In fact, note that if one were to divide up the items roughly equally then I would end up with roughly 1776/2 = 888 in my value; this is well above 713. To ensure the deal is mutually acceptable we typically need to \u201cshare\u201d the surplus above the disagreement point roughly evenly.) \n\nIn the current proposal Player\u00a01 is \u201ckeeping\u201d (i.e. receiving by default) the amounts that are the complements to my offer; indeed, if Player\u00a01\u2019s offer [0, 3, 2, 1, 3] were accepted then Player\u00a01 would end up with \n\u2003\u2003Item\u00a01: 3, Item\u00a02: 3, Item\u00a03: 3, Item\u00a04: 1, Item\u00a05: 4.\nThis division clearly gives me 681 in my value. \n\nTo improve my outcome I can \u201cshift\u201d the split slightly in my favor by asking for a bit more of the high\u2010value items (for me, item 1, item 3, and item 5 are especially \u201cprecious\u201d with values 76, 96, and 90 respectively) while conceding a little more of lower\u2010value items (for me item 4 is worth only 3 per unit). One natural counteroffer is to ask that Player\u00a01 receive a little less than what they currently \u201cclaim\u201d in the original offer. For example, if I offer Player\u00a01 1 unit of item\u00a01 (instead of 3), leaving me 2 units of item\u00a01, while leaving the splits on the other items unchanged, then the counteroffer is for Player\u00a01 to get:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item\u00a01: 1 unit (so that I get 3 \u2013 1 = 2 units)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item\u00a02: 3 units (I get 3)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item\u00a03: 2 units (I get 5 \u2013 2 = 3)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item\u00a04: 1 unit (I get 2 \u2013 1 = 1)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item\u00a05: 3 units (I get 7 \u2013 3 = 4).\n\nUnder this proposed split my totals are:\n\u2003\u2003Item\u00a01: 2\u221976 = 152  \n\u2003\u2003Item\u00a02: 3\u221972 = 216  \n\u2003\u2003Item\u00a03: 3\u221996 = 288  \n\u2003\u2003Item\u00a04: 1\u22193 = 3  \n\u2003\u2003Item\u00a05: 4\u221990 = 360  \nfor a total of 152 + 216 + 288 + 3 + 360 = 1019,\nwhich is comfortably above my outside offer. (At the same time the \u201chalf\u2010split\u201d of the items looks like a fair basis for agreement from Player\u00a01\u2019s perspective.) \n\nSince my current offer of 681 is not acceptable and since I can \u201cimprove\u201d the division by counteroffering a fair (and mutually attractive) near 50\u201350 split, I will not ACCEPT or WALK but instead make a counteroffer.\n\nThus, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 3, 2, 1, 3]}",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

The current offer (from Player 1) gives you:\n\u2003item 1: 0 units\n\u2003item 2: 3 units\n\u2003item 3: 1 unit\n\u2003item 4: 1 unit\n\u2003item 5: 2 units\n\nStep 2: Compute your raw value from that bundle using your private per\u2010unit values:\n\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 0 \u00d7 76 = 0\n\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 3 \u00d7 72 = 216\n\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 1 \u00d7 96 = 96\n\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 1 \u00d7 3 = 3\n\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 2 \u00d7 90 = 180\n\u2003Total = 0 + 216 + 96 + 3 + 180 = 495\n\nStep 3: Adjust for the discount. Since you would be closing the deal in Round 2, the discount factor is gamma^(2\u20131) = 0.98. So the present value if you accept is 495 \u00d7 0.98 \u2248 485.1.\n\nStep 4: Compare with your outside offer. Your private outside option is worth 713 (non\u2010discounted). Since 713 > 485, the current offer is much worse than what you can secure by walking away.\n\nStep 5: Consider the possibility of a counteroffer. Although you could propose a counteroffer, you would need to convince Player 1 to accept a division where your raw value (when discounted) is at least as good as your outside option. In Round 2, any deal would be discounted by 0.98. To beat an outside offer of 713, you\u2019d need a raw value of roughly 713/0.98 \u2248 727.55. The current offer gives you only 495 raw, far below that threshold. Crafting a counteroffer that gives you such a significant advantage while still leaving an enticing proposal for Player 1 is extremely unlikely, given that you don\u2019t know Player 1\u2019s valuation.\n\nStep 6: Conclusion. Given that the current offer delivers an outcome far inferior to your outside option and that the uncertainty in constructing a mutually acceptable counteroffer in Round 2 (with only one round remaining) presents significant risk, your best action is to WALK away and secure your outside offer value of 713.\n\nThus, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Item 5 (worth 19 per unit) is in between.\n\n4. A natural idea is to concede a minimal\u2014but \u201cimpressive\u2010enough\u201d portion of the cake\u2014to entice Player 1. For instance, by \u201cgiving\u201d Player 1 nearly all of the low\u2010value items (all 5 units of items 2 and 4) and only a small portion of the high\u2010value items (just 1 unit of item 1 and 2 units of item 3), we end up with:\n\u2003\u2013 Our counteroffer (the allocation to Player 1): [1, 5, 2, 5, 0]\n\n5. Under this counteroffer the remaining allocation for us is computed by subtracting from the totals:\n\u2003\u2022 item1: 6\u20131 = 5  \n\u2003\u2022 item2: 5\u20135 = 0  \n\u2003\u2022 item3: 5\u20132 = 3  \n\u2003\u2022 item4: 5\u20135 = 0  \n\u2003\u2022 item5: 3\u20130 = 3  \n\u2003Our private\u2010value total then is:\n\u2003\u20035\u00d744 = 220  \n\u2003\u20033\u00d741 = 123  \n\u2003\u20033\u00d719 = 57  \n\u2003Total = 220 + 123 + 57 = 400, which is comfortably above our fallback of 221.\n\n6. From the perspective of Player 1\u2014with values unknown to us but likely roughly averaging around 50 per unit\u2014the bundle we offer ([1, 5, 2, 5, 0]) is not \u201cpitiful.\u201d (For example, if each unit were roughly 50 in value, that share would \u201cvalue\u201d about 1\u00d750 + 5\u00d750 + 2\u00d750 + 5\u00d750 = 13\u00d750 = 650.) Although Player 1\u2019s initial offer gave them much more (by leaving us a mere 45 in our share), our counteroffer improves our payoff while conceding just enough (especially on items we don\u2019t value highly) so that Player 1 might prefer an immediate agreement (with no discount) to prolonging negotiations.\n\n7. Given the above reasoning we choose to counteroffer with [1, 5, 2, 5, 0].\n\nThus, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1,5,2,5,0]}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1239. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1065 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 1, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 5, 2, 5, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 5, 2, 5, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To make an informed decision, let's analyze the situation step-by-step using the questions provided:\n\n### 1) Analyze the current situation:\n\n- **My outside offer value:** 1239\n- **My item values:**\n  - Item 1: 41\n  - Item 2: 89\n  - Item 3: 77\n  - Item 4: 71\n  - Item 5: 77\n\n- **Total pool of items available:**\n  - 6 units of item 1\n  - 5 units of item 2\n  - 5 units of item 3\n  - 5 units of item 4\n  - 3 units of item 5\n\n- **Discount factor:** In round 2, the value of the negotiation is multiplied by gamma^(r-1) = 0.98^(2-1) = 0.98. Therefore, if I accept an offer, the value I calculate for the items will be multiplied by 0.98 to adjust for the second round.\n\n### 2) Assess the value of offers:\n\n- **Current offer on the table (items being offered to me):** [1, 5, 2, 5, 0]\n  - Value calculation:\n    - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 41 = 41\n    - 5 units of item 2 = 5 \u00d7 89 = 445\n    - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 77 = 154\n    - 5 units of item 4 = 5 \u00d7 71 = 355\n    - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 77 = 0\n    - Total value = 41 + 445 + 154 + 355 + 0 = 995\n    - Adjusted for discount factor: 995 \u00d7 0.98 = 975.1\n\n- **Comparison to my outside offer:**\n  - The value of the current offer after discounting is 975.1, which is less than my outside offer of 1239.\n\n### 3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n\n- **Should I accept the current offer?**\n  - No, because the adjusted value (975.1) is less than my outside offer (1239), which violates Mistake 4 if accepted.\n\n- **Should I walk away and take my outside offer?**\n  - This is a viable option since my outside offer (1239) is higher than the current offer after discounting.\n\n- **Should I propose a specific counteroffer?**\n  - The counteroffer should provide me with a value greater than my outside offer of 1239 after discounting. Let's consider a potential counteroffer giving them [2, 2, 2, 2, 0]:\n\n  **Counteroffer [2, 2, 2, 2, 0] (what I give to Player 2):**\n  - 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 41 = 164\n  - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267\n  - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231\n  - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213\n  - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231\n  - Total value = 164 + 267 + 231 + 213 + 231 = 1106\n  - Adjusted for discount factor: 1106 \u00d7 0.98 = 1083.88\n\n- **Comparison:**\n  - The counteroffer value (1083.88) is still less than my outside offer (1239), making it less preferable.\n\nGiven this analysis, none of the potential options during this negotiation round exceed the value of my outside offer. Therefore, the best action is to walk away.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Under your private values this would net you:\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 2\u00d760 = 120  \n\u2003\u2003Item 2: 1\u00d790 = 90  \n\u2003\u2003Item 3: 2\u00d780 = 160  \n\u2003\u2003Item 4: 0\u00d763 = 0  \n\u2003\u2003Item 5: 2\u00d720 = 40  \n\u2003\u2003Total = 120 + 90 + 160 + 0 + 40 = 410.\n2. Your private outside offer is 459. Since 410 < 459, accepting would immediately be worse than your fallback.\n3. As Player 2 in round 1 (where there is no discount penalty yet) you want to secure an outcome that gives you a value at least exceeding your outside offer. Your aim is to \u201cimprove\u201d your share relative to the current offer while leaving Player 1 a sufficiently attractive package so as to induce them to agree.\n4. One natural way to improve your payoff is to reallocate one or more extra \u201cgood\u201d units to yourself. Notice that among your items, item 2 (valued 90 per unit) and item 3 (valued 80 per unit) are particularly high\u2010value for you. Even a single extra unit in one of these would raise your utility considerably.\n5. For example, consider a counteroffer that leaves you with [3, 1, 2, 0, 2]. That allocation would be worth:\n\u2003\u20033\u00d760 + 1\u00d790 + 2\u00d780 + 0\u00d763 + 2\u00d720 = 180 + 90 + 160 + 0 + 40 = 470,\nwhich exceeds 459.\n6. Because the counteroffer format you must provide specifies the number of units being offered to Player 1, you must offer the complementary division. The total items are: [7, 4, 5, 2, 6]. Thus, if you want to end up with [3, 1, 2, 0, 2] you must offer Player 1:\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 7 \u2013 3 = 4  \n\u2003\u2003Item 2: 4 \u2013 1 = 3  \n\u2003\u2003Item 3: 5 \u2013 2 = 3  \n\u2003\u2003Item 4: 2 \u2013 0 = 2  \n\u2003\u2003Item 5: 6 \u2013 2 = 4.\n7. This proposal gives you a current round (non-discounted) value of 470, safely above your outside offer, while allocating nearly all remaining items to Player 1 so that they might see it as acceptable (given their own unknown values and outside offer).\n\nThus, your action in response in round 1 is to issue the following counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 3, 3, 2, 4]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 303. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 381 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Let's work through this step-by-step.\n\n### 1) Analyze the current situation:\n- **Outside offer value**: My outside offer value is 303.\n- **Values of the items**: \n  - Item 1: 59 per unit\n  - Item 2: 13 per unit\n  - Item 3: 2 per unit\n  - Item 4: 23 per unit\n  - Item 5: 30 per unit\n- **Total pool of items**: \n  - 4 units of item 1, \n  - 4 units of item 2, \n  - 3 units of item 3, \n  - 2 units of item 4, \n  - 5 units of item 5.\n- **Discount factor**: The discount factor is 0.98, meaning that each subsequent round reduces the present value of a deal by this factor, specifically at the power of (r-1). As we're in round 1, the discount factor doesn't apply yet.\n\n### 2) Assess the value of offers:\n- **Current offer (from Player 2)**: None. I have the opportunity to make the initial offer.\n  \n- **Assess potential counteroffers**:\n  - I need to make an offer to Player 2, but with the goal of keeping my own value as high as possible while making sure the offer isn't worse than my outside offer.\n\nTo achieve this, I should consider keeping the items which have the highest value to me and offering enough to satisfy both sides but not less than what my outside offer guarantees. Let's try to balance this:\n\n1. **Considerations for my offer**:  \n   I'm aiming to have a total value for myself that is higher than my fallback position.\n   - Retain valuable items for myself like item 1 and item 5 as they have higher values per unit.\n\n2. **Example Calculation**:\n   - Keep all units of item 1 (4 units, total: 4 * 59 = 236 value)\n   - Keep 0 units of item 2 (value = 0)\n   - Keep 0 units of item 3 (value = 0)\n   - Keep 0 units of item 4 (value = 0)\n   - Keep 2 units of item 5 (2 units, total: 2 * 30 = 60 value)\n\n   Total value = 236 (item 1) + 0 (item 2) + 0 (item 3) + 0 (item 4) + 60 (item 5) = 296\n\n   Since this value is less than my outside offer, I'll need to retain at least one more unit or part of another item to exceed the outside offer value (303).\n\n   Let's add 1 unit of item 4 (keeping in mind the overall number of units available):\n\n   - Keep 1 unit of item 4 (1 unit, total: 1 * 23 = 23 value)\n\n   New Total value = 236 (item 1) + 0 (item 2) + 0 (item 3) + 23 (item 4) + 60 (item 5) = 319\n\n   This is now greater than my outside offer value of 303.\n\nWith these considerations, I'll propose offering:\n- 0 units of item 1 to Player 2\n- 4 units of item 2 to Player 2\n- 3 units of item 3 to Player 2\n- 1 unit of item 4 to Player 2\n- 3 units of item 5 to Player 2\n\n### 3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\nI should propose a counteroffer that maximizes value for myself while giving Player 2 a chance to find value from their perspective:\n\nCounteroffer:  \n- Offer 0 units of item 1\n- Offer 4 units of item 2\n- Offer 3 units of item 3\n- Offer 1 unit of item 4\n- Offer 3 units of item 5\n\nThis offer keeps my total value at 319, which is above my fallback value of 303.\n\nMy action:  \n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 4, 3, 1, 3]}\n```",

Therefore, securing a favorable deal early is important to maximize value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer:** None, since I am the one to make the first offer.\n   \n   - **Potential counteroffers:** Let's evaluate an initial offer that ensures my value from the negotiation is higher than my outside offer of 904.\n        \n     - Calculate maximum total value if I kept all items for myself: \n       \\[\n       (5 \\times 12) + (6 \\times 85) + (3 \\times 41) + (5 \\times 80) + (4 \\times 14) = 60 + 510 + 123 + 400 + 56 = 1149\n       \\]\n   \n     Let\u2019s propose a counteroffer where I keep the majority of high-value items based on my valuations but ensure the total value to me is more than 904:\n     - Since my total value is 1149, I need to ensure what I keep is at least 904.\n     - Let\u2019s start by setting:\n       - 1 unit of item 1 to Player 2\n       - 2 units of item 2 to Player 2\n       - 1 unit of item 3 to Player 2\n       - 1 unit of item 4 to Player 2\n       - 2 units of item 5 to Player 2\n     \n     Calculating my remaining value:\n     - 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 12 = 48\n     - 4 units of item 2 = 4 \u00d7 85 = 340\n     - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 41 = 82\n     - 4 units of item 4 = 4 \u00d7 80 = 320\n     - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 14 = 28\n     \n     Total value to me = 48 + 340 + 82 + 320 + 28 = 818\n\n   To maximize my chance of improving my outcome and given the need to propose a meaningful offer, I need to ensure it's slightly better than the outside offer or competitive enough. The above total (818) does not meet my outside offer criterion, so I need to slightly adjust it.\n   \n   Instead, let's propose such that:\n   - 1 unit of item 1 to Player 2\n   - 2 units of item 2 to Player 2\n   - 1 unit of item 3 to Player 2\n   - 1 unit of item 4 to Player 2\n   - 1 unit of item 5 to Player 2\n   \n   Recompute my remaining:\n   - 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 12 = 48\n   - 4 units of item 2 = 4 \u00d7 85 = 340\n   - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 41 = 82\n   - 4 units of item 4 = 4 \u00d7 80 = 320\n   - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42\n   \n   Total value to me = 48 + 340 + 82 + 320 + 42 = 832\n   \n   If I cannot reach 904 and given presumed negotiation advantage of initiating, I can propose this as reasonable allocation directly then alternate providing these expected operational yields over rounds to warrant trade-off of undisclosed Player 2 associated value tips. Given alternative case availability, it should achieve or potentially supersede net losses measured. \n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\nThe objective now is to propose a counteroffer close to my guaranteed alternative result of 904 or higher value as soon as possible considering discounted risk.\n\nThe analysis revealed getting above 904 in a first split hard to ascertain, though offering player 2 a reasonable distribution of high-benefit value items initiates stronger proposition position enjoying above discretionary expectation - thus leveraging cooperation guidance suggests:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 1, 1, 1]}",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This means if negotiations proceed into the next round, the value of the outcome is reduced by a factor of 0.98.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n\n#### Potential Counteroffers:\nI need to come up with an offer that ensures my value is at least equal to or better than my outside offer (373).\n\n##### Example Offer:\nThe aim is to achieve a total value greater than or equal to 373, preferably higher, to account for potential negotiation benefits.\n\nCalculate a feasible division:\n- **Keepings**:\n  - Item 1: 3 units (total = 60)\n  - Item 2: 3 units (total = 75)\n  - Item 3: 2 units (total = 30)\n  - Item 4: 3 units (total = 153)\n  - Item 5: 3 units (total = 12)\n\nCalculate value if keeping the above:\n- Total value = 60 + 75 + 30 + 153 + 12 = 330\n\nThis sum is less than my outside offer of 373, so I shouldn't propose this division.\n\n- **Giving:** \nI realize I can't outright give too much, especially for high-value items like item 4. Here's a revised calculation:\n\n### Offer Proposal: \n- Give Player 2:\n  - Item 1: 0 units (0 value to Player 2)\n  - Item 2: 0 units (0 value to Player 2)\n  - Item 3: 3 units (Player 2's value for this is unknown to me)\n  - Item 4: 0 units (this is valuable to me)\n  - Item 5: 1 unit (Player 2's value for this is unknown to me)\n\nThis ensures my value (330 + 45 = 375 with the above revised) stays above my fallback of 373.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision:\n\nWith the calculation above, this offer of giving [0, 0, 3, 0, 1], ensures I keep most of my valuable items to maintain a fallback above the outside offer after some negotiation leeway.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 3, 0, 1]}\n```",

In order to get that much, I\u2019d have to keep most of the high\u2010value items (item\u00a01 and especially item\u00a05) for myself. But if I insist on keeping those, I would have to offer Player\u00a01 a bundle that is very different from what they already get in the current offer (which currently gives them, in effect, most of the high\u2010value items). Given that any counteroffer that secures my needed share (\u2265416) forces me to concede very little high\u2010value items to Player\u00a01, it is very unlikely that they would accept such a counteroffer over the current allocation they originally laid out. \n\nSince the current offer only gives me 92 (far below my reservation of 416) and any counteroffer that would leave me with at least 416 is unlikely to be acceptable to Player\u00a01, my best guaranteed outcome at this point is to WALK away and take my outside offer of 416.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Since this is round 1, the current round has no discount applied, but future rounds will.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - There is no current offer to accept since this is the first move.\n   - For potential counteroffers, I need to consider different divisions to maximize my value, ensuring it's more than my outside offer of 324.\n   - Calculate the total value for different divisional proposals. I should aim to keep units such that their total value (after division) is greater than 324.\n\nLet's consider how to divide the items in a way that makes my total value exceed 324, yet is a reasonable starting point for negotiation and avoids mistakes such as offering too little or too much (Mistakes 2 and 3).\n\nPossible division:\n- Offer Player 2: [2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5]\n- Calculate the value:\n  - My share: 3 units of item 1 + 1 unit of item 2 + 3 units of item 3 + 1 unit of item 4 + 1 unit of item 5\n  - Total value = (3 \u00d7 35) + (1 \u00d7 53) + (3 \u00d7 33) + (1 \u00d7 16) + (1 \u00d7 51)\n  - Total value = 105 + 53 + 99 + 16 + 51 = 324\n\n3) Make a decision:\n   - This division provides me with exactly my outside offer value of 324.

                    "response": "I'll explain my reasoning briefly.\n\nMy private evaluation of all items adds to 526. In the current offer (which gives me [2,1,1,0,0]) I\u2019d get a value of\n\u2003\u20032\u00d751 + 1\u00d79 + 1\u00d738 = 102 + 9 + 38 = 149,\nwhich is far lower than my outside option of 505. In fact, if I were to take everything I\u2019d get 526; so if I want a negotiated deal that beats my outside offer then I must \u201cconcede\u201d at most (526\u2013505)=21 in my own values.\n\nBecause my per\u2010unit values are 51, 9, 38, 75, and 64, giving away any unit of items 1, 3, 4, or 5 would cost me too much. (Even one unit of item\u202f1 costs 51.) The only \u201ccheap\u201d concession is item\u202f2 (worth 9 per unit). In fact, I can only afford to concede either one unit (cost 9, leaving me 517, which is 12 above my fallback) or both units of item\u202f2 (cost 18, leaving me 508, only 3 points above my outside offer).\n\nNow, notice that Player\u202f1\u2019s initial offer (giving me [2,1,1,0,0]) implies he would \u201ckeep\u201d the rest\u2014i.e. he would have a complementary bundle that (by my numbers) is worth 526\u2013149=377. (Of course his private values are different, but his first offer signals that he would like considerably more than me.) To get him to agree, I must offer him something at least as attractive as his expectation. The only way to do so (without dropping my own share below 505) is to give him both units of item\u202f2; that is, offer him [0,2,0,0,0]. In that case I would receive the remainder, namely:\n\u2003\u2003Item1: 5\u20130 = 5,\n\u2003\u2003Item2: 2\u20132 = 0,\n\u2003\u2003Item3: 3\u20130 = 3,\n\u2003\u2003Item4: 1\u20130 = 1,\n\u2003\u2003Item5: 1\u20130 = 1.\nMy value then would be 5\u00d751 + 3\u00d738 + 1\u00d775 + 1\u00d764 = 255 + 114 + 75 + 64 = 508, which is just above my outside option. (Had I given only 1 unit of item\u202f2, I\u2019d keep 517 but would likely not entice Player\u202f1 given his early stance.)\n\nSince the current offer is way below my fallback, I will not ACCEPT. I also won\u2019t WALK because I have a chance to improve (even if only modestly) over my outside offer by reaching an early negotiated deal that avoids discounting. So, given the reasoning above, I will propose the counteroffer that gives Player\u202f1 [0,2,0,0,0].\n\nThus, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0,2,0,0,0]}",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To decide on the next action, we'll analyze the situation step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n- **Outside Offer Value**: 324\n- **Values of the Items**:\n  - Item 1: 35\n  - Item 2: 53\n  - Item 3: 33\n  - Item 4: 16\n  - Item 5: 51\n- **Total Pool of Items**:\n  - 5 units of item 1\n  - 2 units of item 2\n  - 3 units of item 3\n  - 1 unit of item 4\n  - 1 unit of item 5\n- **Discount Factor**: 0.98 (round 3, the value would be multiplied by \\(0.98^{2}\\))\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n- **Current Offer [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]**:\n  - This means I would receive 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n  - Total value to me = 0 \u00d7 35 + 1 \u00d7 53 + 0 \u00d7 33 + 0 \u00d7 16 + 0 \u00d7 51 = 53\n  - Applying the discount factor: \\(53 \\times 0.98^{2} \\approx 50.95\\)\n  - This is far less than my outside offer of 324.\n  \n- **Potential Counteroffers**:\n  - I should aim for a distribution where my value exceeds 324, after applying the discount factor.\n  - A reasonable starting point would be looking at distribution where I keep most items or high-value ones. The total value without discounts (still needs to be multiplied by discount factor):\n    - Keeping 5 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, and 2 units of item 3 would result in: \n      - Value = 5 \u00d7 35 + 1 \u00d7 53 + 2 \u00d7 33 = 175 + 53 + 66 = 294, past the value with discounts, it's below\n    - Keeping majority of items and only giving a single item 5 to Player 2:\n      - Value = 5 \u00d7 35 + 1 \u00d7 53 + 3 \u00d7 33 + 1 \u00d7 16 = 175 + 53 + 99 + 16 = 343\n      - Applying the discount = \\(343 \\times 0.98^{2} \\approx 329.73\\), which exceeds my outside offer.\n      - Offer: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1] (giving only 1 unit of item 5 to Player 2)\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n- **Current Offer**: Value is significantly less than the outside offer.\n- **Counteroffer Proposal**:\n  - By making the counteroffer [0, 0, 0, 0, 1], my value, accounting for the discount, exceeds my outside offer, so it is a valid aggressive attempt to secure more value.\n\nTherefore, I am proposing a counteroffer that maximizes my value while being a significant enough offer to not make a mistake like offering nothing (Mistake 3). \n\n### Action\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 172. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 579 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

Also, negotiating effectively means starting with an offer that retains as much value for me as possible while remaining fair.\n\nI'm going to propose to keep the most valuable items weighted towards me.

Accepting the current offer would yield 216, which is much less than the secure outcome of 671 if the negotiation falls apart.\n\nStep 3: Consider a counteroffer. In a counteroffer you could try to reallocate the items so that you secure a greater share of the high\u2010value items.

Since the current offer yields 216 (much lower than your safe fallback of 671) and a counteroffer risks delays (and further discounting) without clear information on Player 1\u2019s private values or outside offer, it is best to guarantee yourself the outside value by ending negotiations now.\n\nTherefore, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

The proposal optimally lightens upfront compromise to Player 2 highlighting all potential value out below my external fallback threshold spearheading a balanced objective for mutual competitiveness beneath. This suggests resourceful dealing starting stance while securing grounded foundation on my private end.\n\nI make the strategic counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [5, 5, 3, 6, 3]}\n```\nThis guarantees better than fallback in pursuit of feasible-forward discussions readying remainder steps satisfactorily directing clear closer line focus!",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1074. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 783 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [5, 5, 3, 6, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 3, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 3, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 1074.\n   - My values for the items are:\n     - Item 1: 52\n     - Item 2: 85\n     - Item 3: 53\n     - Item 4: 13\n     - Item 5: 58\n   - The total pool of items is:\n     - Item 1: 5 units\n     - Item 2: 5 units\n     - Item 3: 3 units\n     - Item 4: 6 units\n     - Item 5: 4 units\n   - The discount factor is 0.98, which affects the calculated present value if the negotiation extends into further rounds, reducing the values of outcomes accordingly.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer: [0, 0, 3, 0, 0]\n     - Value to me: 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159\n     \n   - Potential counteroffers:\n     I need to propose divisions where my share would be worth more than my outside offer of 1074 after the discount factor applies.\n\n     Since I cannot accept the current offer (because 159 is much less than my outside offer of 1074), I should consider making a counteroffer to generate a higher value.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - Accept? No, the current offer (159) is much lower than my outside offer (1074).\n   - Walk away? It's an option, but I should first attempt a reasonable counteroffer that maximizes my value.\n   - Propose a counteroffer? Yes, I should try to come up with a counteroffer that brings me more value than my outside offer when adjusted by gamma.\n\nGiven these analyses, I will craft a counteroffer that prioritizes my high-value items while still attempting to strike a balance that could potentially be accepted by Player 2.\n\nLet's calculate a reasonable counteroffer:\n- I highly value items 2 and 5.\n- I would like to propose that I retain all of items 1, 2, and 4.\n- I will share item 3, and provide some of item 5 to Player 2 in hopes it satisfies them.\n\nCounteroffer: [0, 0, 1, 0, 1]\n- This splits item 3 with Player 2 and gives them a portion of item 5, which I hope will be viewed as a sufficient offering.\n\nLet's verify the value to myself:\n- 5 units of item 1 = 5 \u00d7 52 = 260\n- 5 units of item 2 = 5 \u00d7 85 = 425\n- 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 53 = 106\n- 6 units of item 4 = 6 \u00d7 13 = 78\n- 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174\n- Total value to me: 260 + 425 + 106 + 78 + 174 = 1043\n\nSince the discount factor gamma is 0.98 and we are round 2, the adjusted value would be: 1043 * (0.98)^1 = 1022.14\n\n1022.14 after discount is still less than my outside offer of 1074, so I need to further adjust or choose to WALK.\n\nInstead of risking a further discount, I'll choose to WALK, as my outside offer ensures a higher value.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

(Also remember that because we are in round\u00a01 the discount factor \u03b3^(r\u20131) = 1, so there is no time discount yet.) Thus it is not in my interest to accept the current offer.\n\nI want a deal that gives me a value that beats my outside option. My maximum total value if I got everything would be 1383 so I can \u201cafford\u201d to concede up to 1383 \u2013 977 = 406 points worth of value to Player\u00a01. Since my own per\u2010unit values differ a lot across items I want to \u201cpay\u201d mostly with items that I value little.

(Note that while Player\u00a01\u2019s incentives are uncertain because of their private values, my proposal gives me nearly all the high\u2010value items while \u201cpaying\u201d mostly with items I care less about.)\n\nThus, my action in Round\u00a01 is to propose this counteroffer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 4, 2, 3, 0]}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

                    "response": "To determine the appropriate action, we'll walk through the provided step-by-step questions.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n- **Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer is 837.\n- **Values of the Items**: My per-unit values are:\n  - Item 1: 78\n  - Item 2: 90\n  - Item 3: 50\n  - Item 4: 5\n  - Item 5: 69\n- **Total Pool of Items**: Available items:\n  - 2 units of item 1\n  - 9 units of item 2\n  - 2 units of item 3\n  - 3 units of item 4\n  - 7 units of item 5\n- **Discount Factor**: The discount factor is gamma = 0.98. Since it's round 2, this will reduce the effective value of agreements compared to round 1 but it's not yet a dominant factor.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n- **Current Offer on the Table**: [2, 4, 2, 3, 0]\n  - Value of current offer:\n    - Item 1: 2 units \u00d7 78 = 156\n    - Item 2: 4 units \u00d7 90 = 360\n    - Item 3: 2 units \u00d7 50 = 100\n    - Item 4: 3 units \u00d7 5 = 15\n    - Item 5: 0 units \u00d7 69 = 0\n  - Total value = 631\n\n  With the discount factor applied (since it's round 2): 631 \u00d7 0.98 = 618.38\n\n- **Compare to Outside Offer**: 618.38 (current offer) < 837 (outside offer). The current offer is worse than my outside offer.\n\n- **Potential Counteroffers**: Need to ensure any counteroffer gives me a value greater than 837 (outside offer).\n\n- **Initial Offer (Round 1) Analysis**: [0, 2, 1, 2, 4]\n  - Item 1: 0 units \u00d7 78 = 0\n  - Item 2: 7 units \u00d7 90 = 630\n  - Item 3: 1 unit \u00d7 50 = 50\n  - Item 4: 1 unit \u00d7 5 = 5\n  - Item 5: 3 units \u00d7 69 = 207\n  - Total value = 892\n  - After discount: 892 \u00d7 0.98 = 874.16\n  - This value of 874.16 (after discount) is better than my outside offer.\n\n### Step 3: Decision Making\nGiven that the current offer yields a present value of 618.38, which is lower than my outside offer (837), I should counteroffer with a division that gives me a value better than 837 while considering the discount factor. I'll propose a deal that is close to what I initially offered, perhaps adjusting slightly to avoid being too rigid.\n\nA potential counteroffer that ensures my value is better than my outside offer could be:\n- [0, 2, 1, 1, 5]: This maintains the higher value in items 2 and 5, which are more valuable to me.\n\nCounteroffer Calculation:\n- Item 1: 2 units \u00d7 78 = 156\n- Item 2: 7 units \u00d7 90 = 630\n- Item 3: 1 unit \u00d7 50 = 50\n- Item 4: 2 units \u00d7 5 = 10\n- Item 5: 2 units \u00d7 69 = 138\n- Total value = 984\n\nWith discount factor: 984 \u00d7 0.98 = 964.32, which is more than the outside offer of 837.\n\nGiven this analysis, I will make the following counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 1, 1, 5]}",

The longer the negotiation takes, the less valuable the outcome is to me, as future rounds decrease the final value by a factor of \\( \\gamma^{r-1} \\).\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?**\n     There is no current offer on the table.\n\n   - **For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?**\n     Since it's the first round and I have to make the first offer, I will calculate several potential scenarios and choose a favorable one. For simplicity, I should ensure the offer proposed to Player 2 leaves me with a larger value than my outside offer while being reasonable to encourage acceptance.\n\n     Let's calculate for some plausible allocations:\n\n     - **Example counteroffer 1 (keep 3 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5):**\n       - My retained value:\n         - Item 1: 3 \u00d7 51 = 153\n         - Item 2: 1 \u00d7 21 = 21\n         - Item 3: 3 \u00d7 65 = 195\n         - Item 4: 6 \u00d7 74 = 444\n         - Item 5: 1 \u00d7 18 = 18\n       - Total retained value = 153 + 21 + 195 + 444 + 18 = 831\n\n     Since 831 is well above my outside offer value of 36, this is clearly better than walking away.\n\n   - **How do these values compare to my outside offer value?**\n     The value retained by keeping certain items is significantly greater than my outside offer. Therefore, a counteroffer should be strategic, ensuring my retained value is higher than 36.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   Given the considerations, it seems wise to make a first move with a moderate offer and propose I keep more valuable items while leaving some room for negotiation in subsequent rounds without risking a walk.\n\n   I propose the initial counteroffer mentioned above.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 2, 2, 1]}\n```\n\nThis signifies I am offering Player 2:\n- 1 unit of item 1\n- 0 units of item 2\n- 2 units of item 3\n- 2 units of item 4\n- 1 unit of item 5\n\nThis aims to ensure I maintain a high total value while considering Player 2's values and allowing room for negotiation.",

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 2, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 2, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "First, note that accepting the current offer \u2013 which would give you [1, 0, 2, 2, 1] \u2013 would yield a value of \n\u2003\u20031\u00d774 + 0\u00d759 + 2\u00d731 + 2\u00d788 + 1\u00d774 = 74 + 0 + 62 + 176 + 74 = 386,\nwhich is well below your outside option of 625. (Also, since we are in Round 1 the discount factor is \u03b3\u2070 = 1.) Therefore, accepting now is not attractive.\n\nBecause if no agreement is reached you can \u201cwalk away\u201d for a secure 625, any deal you propose must give you at least 625 (when computed with your private per\u2010unit values). At the same time, you want to \u201csell\u201d items that are less valuable to you (or that you care least about) in order to sweeten the deal for Player\u00a01 and encourage him to accept. For you the lowest\u2010valued item is item 3 (worth 31 per unit) and your item 2 (worth 59 per unit) is also relatively less compared to item 1 (74), item 4 (88), or item 5 (74).\n\nOne reasonable approach is to \u201csplit\u201d the total surplus fairly relative to your own value. Your total value if you got everything is 1362, so a fair (50\u201350) split in your eyes would yield about 681 for each side. However, since your outside option is 625, you have some bargaining power to claim a bit more. At the same time, Player\u00a01 must receive enough in his bundle (as measured by his private values, though you don\u2019t see those numbers) to have an incentive to accept rather than depending on his own outside offer. \n\nA plausible counteroffer is as follows. Represent an outcome by a vector o = [o\u2081, o\u2082, o\u2083, o\u2084, o\u2085] meaning that o\u1d62 is the number of units of item i allocated to Player\u00a01; then you receive the complementary bundle T \u2013 o, where T = [4, 1, 5, 8, 2]. One proposal is to set:\n\u2003\u2003o = [2, 1, 3, 2, 1].\n\nLet\u2019s check what this means:\n\n\u2022\u2003Player\u00a01 would get 2 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 2 of item 4, and 1 of item 5.\n\u2022\u2003You would get the remainder:\n\u2003\u2003[4\u20132, 1\u20131, 5\u20133, 8\u20132, 2\u20131] = [2, 0, 2, 6, 1].\n\nYour value for that bundle is:\n\u2003\u20032\u00d774 + 0\u00d759 + 2\u00d731 + 6\u00d788 + 1\u00d774\n\u2003\u2003 = 148 + 0 + 62 + 528 + 74\n\u2003\u2003 = 812,\nwhich is well above your fallback of 625.\n\nIn addition, by \u201cpackaging\u201d items that are less valuable to you \u2013 notably, transferring extra units of item 3 \u2013 you give Player\u00a01 a bundle that is more attractive from his (unknown) perspective. (For example, using my own numbers, the value of the bundle offered to P1 by my measure would be:\n\u2003\u20032\u00d774 + 1\u00d759 + 3\u00d731 + 2\u00d788 + 1\u00d774\n\u2003\u2003 = 148 + 59 + 93 + 176 + 74\n\u2003\u2003 = 550,\nwhich may be competitive with his outside offer.)\n\nThus, in Round\u00a01, a sound strategic move is to make this counteroffer:\n\u2003\u2003Offer to give Player\u00a01: [2, 1, 3, 2, 1].\n\nAccording to the required response format, my answer is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 3, 2, 1]}",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.
