If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [8, 0, 8, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    40 x 8 + 18 x 0 + 23 x 8 + 63 x 1 + 98 x 1\n    which is 665 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 666. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

This means that the value of an agreement decreases slightly in later rounds.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**  I need to propose an offer that is better than my outside offer. I will start by making a reasonable offer to the other player and then assessing the value.\n    I want to make a proposal that allows me to keep most of the valuable items (4 and 5), while giving away most of the less valuable items (1, 2, and 3).\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince there is no current offer, I will propose a counteroffer that I believe is reasonable.\n\nLet's try offering the other player the following: 7 units of Item 1, 1 unit of Item 2, 6 units of Item 3, 0 units of Item 4, and 1 unit of Item 5.\n\nThis leaves me with: 5 units of Item 1, 1 unit of Item 2, 4 units of Item 3, 1 unit of Item 4, and 3 units of Item 5.\n\nMy value would be:\n(5 * 40) + (1 * 18) + (4 * 23) + (1 * 63) + (3 * 98) = 200 + 18 + 92 + 63 + 294 = 667\n\nThis value (667) is just barely above my outside offer (666). Since the discount factor is 0.98, waiting would make this difference smaller and therefore less likely for me to benefit. Let's try a new proposal that would give me some more room to maneuver later.\n\nLet's try offering the other player the following: 6 units of Item 1, 1 unit of Item 2, 5 units of Item 3, 0 units of Item 4, and 1 unit of Item 5.\n\nThis leaves me with: 6 units of Item 1, 1 unit of Item 2, 5 units of Item 3, 1 unit of Item 4, and 3 units of Item 5.\n\nMy value would be:\n(6 * 40) + (1 * 18) + (5 * 23) + (1 * 63) + (3 * 98) = 240 + 18 + 115 + 63 + 294 = 730\n\nThis value (730) is above my outside offer (666), so I can make this offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [6, 1, 5, 0, 1]}\n```",

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [6, 1, 5, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [5, 1, 5, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [5, 1, 5, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 666.\n   - My values for the items are: item 1 = 40, item 2 = 18, item 3 = 23, item 4 = 63, item 5 = 98.\n   - The total pool of items is: item 1 = 12, item 2 = 2, item 3 = 10, item 4 = 1, item 5 = 4.\n   - The discount factor is 0.98. Accepting an offer in round 2 means the value is multiplied by 0.98^(2-1) = 0.98.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer: [5, 1, 5, 0, 1] means I receive 5 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n     - My value for this offer is (5 * 40) + (1 * 18) + (5 * 23) + (0 * 63) + (1 * 98) = 200 + 18 + 115 + 0 + 98 = 431.\n     - Discounted value is 431 * 0.98 = 422.38. This is less than my outside offer of 666.\n\n   - Let's consider a counteroffer. I want to keep enough items to exceed my outside offer of 666.\n\n   - Let's consider keeping:\n        - All of item 5 (4 units): 4 * 98 = 392\n        - All of item 4 (1 unit): 1 * 63 = 63\n        This is 455. Need another 211.\n\n        - All of item 1 (12 units): 12 * 40 = 480\n        - All of item 2 (2 units): 2 * 18 = 36\n        - All of item 3 (10 units): 10 * 23 = 230\n        If I keep all of item 5, item 4 and then 5 units of item 1, my total becomes\n        392 + 63 + (5 * 40) = 392 + 63 + 200 = 655. Still less than 666.\n\n        If I keep all of items 4 and 5, then to get over 666 I need another 666 - 455 = 211. I can get this from item 1 by needing 211 / 40 = 5.275 or 6 units.\n        If I keep 6 units of item 1 and all of items 4 and 5:\n        6 * 40 + 1 * 63 + 4 * 98 = 240 + 63 + 392 = 695 > 666. This is a possible target.\n\n    - Counteroffer: Give away all of item 2 and item 3, and (12-6) = 6 units of item 1 to player 2. Also give away item 4 and item 5 completely. This gives the offer to the other player to be [6, 2, 10, 1, 4]. \n     - If I make this counteroffer, I keep [6, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - The current offer (discounted) is worse than my outside offer.\n   - I can make a counteroffer that will give me value better than my outside offer. The counteroffer [6, 2, 10, 1, 4] results in me keeping [6, 0, 0, 0, 0] with a value of 6 * 40 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 240. This is far less than my outside offer.\n\nLet's try another approach. I want to keep all of item 5 (4 * 98 = 392), all of item 4 (1 * 63 = 63), and then some of item 1 (x * 40), item 2 (y * 18) and item 3 (z * 23) so that the result exceeds 666.\nLet's first consider keeping items 4 and 5 completely, then enough of item 1 to push it over.\n\n4 * 98 + 1 * 63 + x * 40 > 666\n392 + 63 + x * 40 > 666\n455 + x * 40 > 666\nx * 40 > 211\nx > 5.275\n\nSo, I keep 6 units of item 1, and all of items 4 and 5. This means I offer the other player 6 units of item 1, all of item 2, all of item 3, zero item 4 and zero item 5. The offer becomes [6, 2, 10, 0, 0]. My value is 6 * 40 + 1 * 63 + 4 * 98 = 240 + 63 + 392 = 695. Since 695 > 666, this is a better offer than walking away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [6, 2, 10, 0, 0]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 420. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 465 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 2, 10, 1, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 513. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 651 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 5, 3, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    10 x 3 + 85 x 5 + 19 x 3 + 63 x 0 + 40 x 0\n    which is 512 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 513. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [7, 7, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [7, 7, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value.

This means that an offer in a later round is worth slightly less to me.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]. This means I would receive:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 93 = 93\n    *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 9 = 9\n    *   0 unit of item 3: 0 * 84 = 0\n    *   0 unit of item 4: 0 * 49 = 0\n    *   1 unit of item 5: 1 * 6 = 6\n    *   Total value of current offer = 93 + 9 + 0 + 0 + 6 = 108\n\n*   **My value if I accept:** 108\n\n*   **My outside offer:** 458\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what happens if I make a counteroffer. If it is rejected, and the game ends in the next round, my total value will also be decreased by the discount factor of 0.98.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer of 108 is significantly worse than my outside offer of 458. Accepting would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\n\nI need to decide whether to WALK or make a COUNTEROFFER. Let's consider my potential best-case scenario if I make a counteroffer. I can keep as much as I can to myself. In this case, I can offer the other player close to nothing and have all the items for myself.\n\nIf I keep all the items:\n*   4 units of item 1 = 4 * 93 = 372\n*   5 units of item 2 = 5 * 9 = 45\n*   1 unit of item 3 = 1 * 84 = 84\n*   1 unit of item 4 = 1 * 49 = 49\n*   3 units of item 5 = 3 * 6 = 18\n*   Total value = 372 + 45 + 84 + 49 + 18 = 568\n\nSince 568 > 458, a deal where I take everything is better than my outside offer.\nSince this is round 2, if my counteroffer is rejected my total value is 568 * 0.98 = 556.64\n\nI will make a counteroffer that is beneficial for me. I will offer the other player [0,0,0,0,0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 458. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 723 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 3, 1, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    93 x 3 + 9 x 3 + 84 x 1 + 49 x 1 + 6 x 3\n    which is 457 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 458. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [2, 1, 0, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 0, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

I should focus on giving away items with lower value to me while keeping the higher-value items.\n\nMy item values (per unit):\n- Item 1: 5 (low value)\n- Item 2: 8 (medium value)\n- Item 3: 17 (high value)\n- Item 4: 1 (lowest value)\n- Item 5: 16 (high value)\n\nLet me try to formulate a counteroffer where I keep most of the high-value items and offer some of the lower-value items:\n\nIf I offer [2, 1, 1, 2, 2] to Player 1, I would keep:\n- 1 unit of item 1: 1 \u00d7 5 = 5\n- 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 8 = 8\n- 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 17 = 34\n- 0 units of item 4: 0 \u00d7 1 = 0\n- 4 units of item 5: 4 \u00d7 16 = 64\n\nTotal value for me: 5 + 8 + 34 + 0 + 64 = 111, which is better than my outside offer of 88.\n\n## Step 3: Make a decision\n\nSince Player 1's initial offer gives me nothing (0 value), which is much worse than my outside offer (88), I should make a counteroffer.\n\nMy counteroffer of [2, 1, 1, 2, 2] gives me a value of 111, which is better than my outside offer of 88. This offer gives Player 1 some of each item type while allowing me to keep most of the high-value items.\n\nTherefore, I'll make this counteroffer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 1, 2, 2]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 970. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1041 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 2, 3, 2, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    77 x 3 + 86 x 2 + 84 x 3 + 64 x 2 + 36 x 5\n    which is 963 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 970. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 2, 3, 2, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    77 x 3 + 86 x 2 + 84 x 3 + 64 x 2 + 36 x 5\n    which is 963 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 970. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 1, 1, 2, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [2, 0, 1, 2, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 0, 1, 2, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action for Player 1.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** 970\n*   **Item values:** Item 1: 77, Item 2: 86, Item 3: 84, Item 4: 64, Item 5: 36\n*   **Total items:** 3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.98. Since this is round 3, the discount factor is 0.98^(3-1) = 0.98^2 = 0.9604. The discount factor only matters if I am anticipating future rounds, but since this is the last round, it is not relevant to my decision.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** [2, 0, 1, 2, 2]\n    This means I receive 2 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n\n    My value for the current offer: (2 * 77) + (0 * 86) + (1 * 84) + (2 * 64) + (2 * 36) = 154 + 0 + 84 + 128 + 72 = 438\n\n*   **Compare to outside offer:** 438 < 970. Accepting the current offer is worse than walking away and taking my outside offer.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to determine if there's a counteroffer I can make that is better than my outside offer and that Player 2 might accept. Since Player 2 will walk away at the end of this round if they don't accept, any potential counteroffer from me will be to try and get as many items as possible for myself while offering *something* of value to player 2 to get them to accept it. Given that round 2's offer from player 2 was [2, 0, 1, 2, 2], I assume they value Item 2 greatly and may be trying to get it all for themself (as evidenced by the '0' offered to me).\n\n    Let's consider keeping all the items for myself:\n    (3 * 77) + (2 * 86) + (3 * 84) + (2 * 64) + (6 * 36) = 231 + 172 + 252 + 128 + 216 = 999. This is slightly better than my outside offer.\n\n    So, I could offer Player 2 a small amount of item 5, which is my lowest value. If I offered, say, 1 unit of item 5, then I would keep 5. My offer would be [0, 0, 0, 0, 1].\n    My value from such a deal would be: (3 * 77) + (2 * 86) + (3 * 84) + (2 * 64) + (5 * 36) = 231 + 172 + 252 + 128 + 180 = 963. This is still worse than my outside offer.\n    Since it is the last round, I should just walk away.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\nSince the current offer is worse than my outside offer, and I can't find a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer and that Player 2 would accept, I should walk away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    27 x 0 + 2 x 0 + 17 x 1 + 81 x 1 + 41 x 1\n    which is 139 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 140. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 4, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 3, 2, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 3, 2, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

This means offers in later rounds are worth slightly less to both players.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer: None.\n   - Potential counteroffers: I need to formulate an offer to Player 2 that maximizes my value while being potentially acceptable to them. I need to offer something, but not too much. I'll start by offering roughly half of the items, prioritizing items that are less valuable to me, but still have some value. My goal is to retain a combination of items worth more than 1362.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n   - Since there is no current offer, I cannot accept or reject. I need to make an initial offer to Player 2.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I offer Player 2: 2 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5. This leaves me with: 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n\nMy value for this division would be:\n(3 * 95) + (4 * 41) + (1 * 21) + (3 * 75) + (2 * 61) = 285 + 164 + 21 + 225 + 122 = 817.

This will amount to giving away [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]. My calculation is:\n(5 * 95) + (7 * 41) + (1 * 21) + (6 * 75) + (2 * 61) = 475 + 287 + 21 + 450 + 122 = 1355. Still not there.\n\nI will try to offer only 1 unit of item 2. My offer is [0,1,0,0,0]. My calculation:\n(5 * 95) + (7 * 41) + (1 * 21) + (6 * 75) + (3 * 61) = 475 + 287 + 21 + 450 + 183 = 1416.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 1, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    8 x 0 + 71 x 3 + 16 x 1 + 50 x 0 + 17 x 1\n    which is 246 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 247. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 118. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 118. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 747 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 0, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    65 x 1 + 1 x 0 + 57 x 0 + 74 x 0 + 52 x 1\n    which is 117 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 118. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 1, 2, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.98 times its face value, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 0.98^2 = 0.9604 times its face value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   Current offer: None.\n*   Potential counteroffers: I need to find an offer that gives me a value greater than 922.\n\nSince I have no offer to respond to, I must make an initial offer. I need to decide what to offer Player 2. To avoid mistake 3 (offering nothing or everything), I need to offer some, but not all, items. I will start by trying to find an offer that gives Player 2 approximately half the total value (1296/2 = 648). This allows me room to adjust if my initial calculation isn't accurate.\n\nLet's start with offering Player 2 half of item 2, half of item 3, half of item 4, and half of item 5, rounding where needed since you can't split items. This translates to:\n* Item 2: 2\n* Item 3: 3\n* Item 4: 1\n* Item 5: 2\n\nKeeping:\n* Item 2: 3\n* Item 3: 3\n* Item 4: 2\n* Item 5: 2\n\nValue to me:\n3 * 68 + 3 * 92 + 2 * 44 + 2 * 68 = 204 + 276 + 88 + 136 = 704\n\nThis is too low. I need to be more aggressive. I will lower what I offer Player 2 and keep more items for myself.\n\nLet's try offering Player 2 a minimal amount:\n* Item 2: 1\n* Item 3: 1\n* Item 4: 1\n* Item 5: 1\n\nKeeping:\n* Item 2: 4\n* Item 3: 5\n* Item 4: 2\n* Item 5: 3\n\nValue to me:\n4 * 68 + 5 * 92 + 2 * 44 + 3 * 68 = 272 + 460 + 88 + 204 = 1024\n\nThis is a good starting point, since it is above my outside offer of 922. Let's make this my counteroffer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\nI should make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 5, 6, 1, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    35 x 0 + 48 x 5 + 9 x 6 + 41 x 1 + 87 x 4\n    which is 683 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 687. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 5, 6, 1, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    35 x 0 + 48 x 5 + 9 x 6 + 41 x 1 + 87 x 4\n    which is 683 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 687. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 6, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

My previous offer [0, 0, 6, 0, 0] gave them only item 3, which has the lowest value to me (9 per unit).\n   \n   Let me consider a different allocation. Item 3 is my lowest value item (9), so I should offer most or all of these. I value item 5 highest (87), so I should keep most of these.\n\n   Let me try offering [0, 1, 6, 1, 0]:\n   - I keep: 0 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5\n   - Value: 0 + (4\u00d748) + 0 + (2\u00d741) + (4\u00d787) = 0 + 192 + 0 + 82 + 348 = 622\n   \n   This is less than my outside offer (687), so not good.\n\n   Let me try [0, 0, 6, 1, 0]:\n   - I keep: 0 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5\n   - Value: 0 + (5\u00d748) + 0 + (2\u00d741) + (4\u00d787) = 0 + 240 + 0 + 82 + 348 = 670\n   \n   Still less than my outside offer.\n\n   Let me try [0, 0, 6, 0, 0]:\n   - I keep: 0 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5\n   - Value: 0 + (5\u00d748) + 0 + (3\u00d741) + (4\u00d787) = 0 + 240 + 0 + 123 + 348 = 711\n   \n   With discount: 711 \u00d7 0.98 = 696.78, which exceeds my outside offer of 687.\n\n   Since this is the final round, if I make a counteroffer it would be treated as a WALK. Let me compare my options:\n   - Walk away: I get my outside offer of 687\n   - Make counteroffer: Treated as WALK, so I also get 687\n   - Accept current offer: I get 0 (unacceptable)\n\nSince this is round 2 and there's one more round left, I'll make a counteroffer that gives me enough value while trying to be somewhat fair to Player 1. I'll stick with my original offer which gives them all of item 3 (which I value least) while I keep the more valuable items.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 6, 0, 0]}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    48 x 0 + 96 x 0 + 95 x 0 + 87 x 0 + 78 x 0\n    which is 0 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 6. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 2, 3, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 2, 3, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 2, 1, 5, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    97 x 2 + 69 x 2 + 87 x 1 + 65 x 5 + 15 x 1\n    which is 759 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 761. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

This will have a value of:\n4 * 97 + 2 * 69 + 1 * 87 = 388 + 138 + 87 = 613.\n\nThis is too low, so I will keep all of item 4 as well. This will have a value of:\n613 + 5 * 65 = 613 + 325 = 938.\n\nThis is higher than my outside offer, so I want to offer nothing for item 4. Now to decide about item 5. Let's try keeping all 3. This will be\n938 + 3 * 15 = 938 + 45 = 983.\n\nSo my offer could be:\nitem 1 = 0\nitem 2 = 0\nitem 3 = 0\nitem 4 = 0\nitem 5 = 0\nand I keep everything\n\nLet's try to formulate a counteroffer.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 0, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    1 x 0 + 90 x 2 + 87 x 0 + 12 x 1 + 81 x 3\n    which is 435 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 436. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

It's unlikely I could get a better deal, and the discount factor means future deals will be worth less.\n\nLooking at potential mistakes to avoid:\n- This isn't mistake 4 since the offer is better than my outside offer\n- This isn't mistake 5 since I'm not walking away from a good offer\n\nTherefore, I will accept Player 1's offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 60. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 378 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 0, 0, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    8 x 4 + 23 x 0 + 47 x 0 + 22 x 0 + 26 x 1\n    which is 58 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 60. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 3, 3, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 1, 2, 5, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 1, 2, 5, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 60.\n   - My item values are: item 1 = 8, item 2 = 23, item 3 = 47, item 4 = 22, item 5 = 26.\n   - The total pool of items is: 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor is 0.98. Since this is round 2, the discount factor will be raised to the power of (2-1) = 1, so the effective discount is 0.98.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [3, 1, 2, 5, 0]. This means I get:\n      - 3 units of item 1: 3 * 8 = 24\n      - 1 unit of item 2: 1 * 23 = 23\n      - 2 units of item 3: 2 * 47 = 94\n      - 5 units of item 4: 5 * 22 = 110\n      - 0 units of item 5: 0 * 26 = 0\n      - Total value of current offer: 24 + 23 + 94 + 110 + 0 = 251.\n      - Discounted value of the current offer: 251 * 0.98 = 245.98\n\n   - **Comparison to outside offer:** The discounted value of the current offer (245.98) is much better than my outside offer (60). So, accepting is significantly better than walking away right now.\n\n   - **Considering a counteroffer:** Before deciding, I should consider whether I can get an even better deal by making a counteroffer. Player 1's previous offer in Round 1 was [2, 2, 3, 3, 1]. This means they would have given me:\n      - 2 units of item 1: 2 * 8 = 16\n      - 2 unit of item 2: 2 * 23 = 46\n      - 3 units of item 3: 3 * 47 = 141\n      - 3 units of item 4: 3 * 22 = 66\n      - 1 units of item 5: 1 * 26 = 26\n      - Total value of round 1 offer: 16 + 46 + 141 + 66 + 26 = 295.\n      - Discounted value of round 1 offer: 295 * 0.98 = 289.1.\n\n      However, Player 2 rejected this counteroffer. Given the high value of the current offer, it's unlikely I can get much more without risking a walk in the next round.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - The current offer is significantly better than my outside offer.\n\nTherefore, I should accept the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 271. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 345 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 4, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    29 x 0 + 18 x 1 + 3 x 0 + 57 x 4 + 8 x 3\n    which is 270 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 271. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

I need to be careful to not give away so much that what I keep is worth less than my outside offer.\n\nLet's start by considering an offer where I keep a little more than half of everything, and then calculate the value to me.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 446. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 645 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 6, 1, 2, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    3 x 1 + 54 x 6 + 75 x 1 + 17 x 2 + 66 x 0\n    which is 436 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 446. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value is 446.\n*   My values for the items are: item 1 = 3, item 2 = 54, item 3 = 75, item 4 = 17, item 5 = 66.\n*   The total pool of items is: 1 unit of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5.\n*   The discount factor is 0.98. This means that accepting an offer in a later round is worth less than accepting the same offer in an earlier round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** The current offer gives me [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]. This means I receive 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n    My value for this offer is (0 * 3) + (1 * 54) + (0 * 75) + (1 * 17) + (0 * 66) = 0 + 54 + 0 + 17 + 0 = 71.\n    Since this is round 2, the discounted value is 71 * (0.98^(2-1)) = 71 * 0.98 = 69.58\n\n*   **Outside offer:** My outside offer is worth 446.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what value I would get from different divisions of the items. My goal is to get a value greater than my outside offer. Let's calculate the value I get if I keep everything: (1 * 3) + (6 * 54) + (1 * 75) + (6 * 17) + (0 * 66) = 3 + 324 + 75 + 102 + 0 = 504.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is worth 69.58, which is much less than my outside offer of 446. Therefore, I should not accept the current offer. I should also not walk away immediately, as the total value of the items is 504, meaning there is room for a mutually beneficial deal.\n\nI want to make a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 446, while also giving Player 2 enough to make it worthwhile for them to accept.  Let's aim to keep most of the valuable items (2 and 3) and give away some of the less valuable ones (1 and 4).\n\nI will offer Player 2 [1, 2, 1, 3, 0].  This leaves me with [0, 4, 0, 3, 0]. The value I get from this split is:\n(0 * 3) + (4 * 54) + (0 * 75) + (3 * 17) + (0 * 66) = 0 + 216 + 0 + 51 + 0 = 267.\nThat's still not enough.\n\nI will offer Player 2 [1, 1, 0, 1, 0] This leaves me with [0, 5, 1, 5, 0].\nMy value is (0 * 3) + (5 * 54) + (1 * 75) + (5 * 17) + (0 * 66) = 0 + 270 + 75 + 85 + 0 = 430.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 6, 1, 2, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    3 x 1 + 54 x 6 + 75 x 1 + 17 x 2 + 66 x 0\n    which is 436 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 446. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

I'll start by exploring offers that give away the lower valued items and smaller amounts of the higher value items.\n\nHere's an initial attempt to construct an offer, focusing on giving away more of item 3 (my lowest value item). I'll give Player 2: 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 0 unit of item 5. That's the offer [1, 1, 4, 0, 0].\nWhat I keep: 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5.\nMy value: (1 * 49) + (2 * 31) + (2 * 3) + (4 * 50) + (6 * 48) = 49 + 62 + 6 + 200 + 288 = 605\n\nSince 605 > 584, this is better than my outside offer.\n\nHere's another possible offer: I'll give Player 2: 0 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4, 0 unit of item 5. That's the offer [0, 2, 6, 1, 0].\nWhat I keep: 2 unit of item 1, 1 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5.\nMy value: (2 * 49) + (1 * 31) + (0 * 3) + (3 * 50) + (6 * 48) = 98 + 31 + 0 + 150 + 288 = 567\n\nSince 567 < 584, this is worse than my outside offer.\n\n4. **Make a decision:**\nThe offer [1, 1, 4, 0, 0] results in a better value than my outside offer. Therefore, I will make this offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 4, 0, 0]}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items.

Your value would be:\n    88 x 1 + 82 x 0 + 1 x 3 + 95 x 1 + 13 x 3\n    which is 225 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 226. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 584. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 543 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value.

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 593. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 593. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 726 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 4, 7, 0, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    50 x 3 + 40 x 4 + 5 x 7 + 65 x 0 + 82 x 3\n    which is 591 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 593. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's start by analyzing the situation.\n\n1) **Current Situation:**\n   - My outside offer value: 593\n   - My values for items: item 1 = 50, item 2 = 40, item 3 = 5, item 4 = 65, item 5 = 82\n   - Total items: item 1 = 4, item 2 = 5, item 3 = 7, item 4 = 0, item 5 = 3\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.98.  This means that waiting reduces the value by 2% per round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer: None. This means I have all the items if I walk, for a value of 4*50 + 5*40 + 7*5 + 0*65 + 3*82 = 200 + 200 + 35 + 0 + 246 = 681.\n   - Since I am Player 1, I get to make the first offer. I need to offer Player 2 enough to make them want to accept, but also keep enough for myself so that my value is greater than 593. I have to be careful because Player 2 has a private outside offer as well as private valuations for the items.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - Since it is round 1, I have to make a counteroffer. I want to make an offer that is likely to be accepted. Let's see what happens if I offer Player 2 roughly half the items. Since item 4 is 0, lets just consider the other 4 types of items\n\nI will start by calculating my value if I keep the following items for myself:\n- item 1: 2\n- item 2: 2\n- item 3: 3\n- item 4: 0\n- item 5: 1\nMy total value = 2*50 + 2*40 + 3*5 + 0*65 + 1*82 = 100 + 80 + 15 + 0 + 82 = 277. This is less than my outside offer, so I will have to keep more for myself.\n\nI will start by calculating my value if I offer Player 2 the following items:\n- item 1: 1\n- item 2: 2\n- item 3: 3\n- item 4: 0\n- item 5: 1\nI keep the rest:\n- item 1: 3\n- item 2: 3\n- item 3: 4\n- item 4: 0\n- item 5: 2\nMy total value = 3*50 + 3*40 + 4*5 + 0*65 + 2*82 = 150 + 120 + 20 + 0 + 164 = 454. This is less than my outside offer.\n\nI will start by calculating my value if I offer Player 2 the following items:\n- item 1: 0\n- item 2: 1\n- item 3: 2\n- item 4: 0\n- item 5: 0\nI keep the rest:\n- item 1: 4\n- item 2: 4\n- item 3: 5\n- item 4: 0\n- item 5: 3\nMy total value = 4*50 + 4*40 + 5*5 + 0*65 + 3*82 = 200 + 160 + 25 + 0 + 246 = 631. This is more than my outside offer.\n\nI will start by calculating my value if I offer Player 2 the following items:\n- item 1: 0\n- item 2: 2\n- item 3: 3\n- item 4: 0\n- item 5: 1\nI keep the rest:\n- item 1: 4\n- item 2: 3\n- item 3: 4\n- item 4: 0\n- item 5: 2\nMy total value = 4*50 + 3*40 + 4*5 + 0*65 + 2*82 = 200 + 120 + 20 + 0 + 164 = 504.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 4, 7, 0, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    50 x 3 + 40 x 4 + 5 x 7 + 65 x 0 + 82 x 3\n    which is 591 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 593. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 2, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 3, 2, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 3, 2, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 7, 0, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    53 x 0 + 61 x 7 + 29 x 0 + 80 x 1 + 29 x 1\n    which is 536 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 538.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 7, 0, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    53 x 0 + 61 x 7 + 29 x 0 + 80 x 1 + 29 x 1\n    which is 536 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 538. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 3, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 6, 3, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 6, 3, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Current Situation Analysis:**\n\n*   **My Outside Offer:** 538\n*   **Item Values:**\n    *   Item 1: 53\n    *   Item 2: 61\n    *   Item 3: 29\n    *   Item 4: 80\n    *   Item 5: 29\n*   **Total Item Pool:**\n    *   Item 1: 1 unit\n    *   Item 2: 9 units\n    *   Item 3: 4 units\n    *   Item 4: 2 units\n    *   Item 5: 2 units\n*   **Discount Factor:** gamma = 0.98. This means an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.98 times its value, and in round 3 is worth 0.98^2 times its value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** Player 2 is offering me [0, 6, 3, 2, 0].  This means I would receive:\n    *   Item 1: 1 - 0 = 1 unit\n    *   Item 2: 9 - 6 = 3 units\n    *   Item 3: 4 - 3 = 1 unit\n    *   Item 4: 2 - 2 = 0 units\n    *   Item 5: 2 - 0 = 2 units\n    My value for this offer is: (1 * 53) + (3 * 61) + (1 * 29) + (0 * 80) + (2 * 29) = 53 + 183 + 29 + 0 + 58 = 323\n    Since this is round 2, the discounted value of accepting this offer is 323 * 0.98 = 316.54.\n\nThis value (316.54) is less than my outside offer (538). Therefore, accepting this offer would be Mistake 4.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than my outside offer.\n    Also, I need to consider the discount factor.\n\nLet's try to construct a counteroffer where I get most of the valuable items (Item 4 and Item 2) and see how it compares to my outside offer. I will offer the other player the minimum necessary, which is to leave them with 0 of everything.\n\nCounteroffer: [1, 9, 4, 2, 2] to Player 2. This means I keep [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nValue: (0 * 53) + (0 * 61) + (0 * 29) + (0 * 80) + (0 * 29) = 0\nThis is terrible, and clearly less than 538. This is Mistake 2.\n\nLet's aim for at least half of the total value of all the items which is 936/2 = 468. Let's try keeping all of item 4 (2 units) and then some of item 2 to get close. 2 * 80 = 160.\nWe need about 300 more so lets aim for around 5 units of item 2. 5 * 61 = 305.\nCounteroffer [1, 4, 4, 0, 2]. This means I keep [0, 5, 0, 2, 0]\nMy value is 0 + 5 * 61 + 0 + 2 * 80 + 0 = 305 + 160 = 465.\nDiscounted value is 465 * 0.98 = 455.7 This is lower than my outside offer.\n\nLets try for a larger proportion. Aim for a value over 538/0.98 = 549. This means keep the two item 4 = 160. This mean keep almost all the item 2 and some more. Try keep all of item 2.\nCounteroffer: [1, 0, 4, 0, 2] to Player 2.  I keep: [0, 9, 0, 2, 0]. My value: 9 * 61 + 2 * 80 = 549 + 160 = 709.\n709 * 0.98 = 694.82. Definitely better than the outside offer.\n\n3) **Decision:**\nSince I have a counteroffer that gives me a value better than my outside offer, I will propose it.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 4, 0, 2]}\n```",

This is way below my outside offer of 259.\n\nLet's increase that and offer the following:\n\nOffering Player 2: \\[0, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\nThis means I keep: \\[4, 3, 4, 1, 2]\n\nMy value would then be:\n\n4 * 24 + 3 * 7 + 4 * 17 + 1 * 13 + 2 * 92 = 96 + 21 + 68 + 13 + 184 = 382\n\nThis is better than my outside offer, and seems like a very reasonable first offer.\n\n**Final Decision:**\n\nI will make a counteroffer, giving Player 2 \\[0, 2, 0, 0, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Current Situation:**\n   - My outside offer value: 259\n   - Item values: Item 1 = 24, Item 2 = 7, Item 3 = 17, Item 4 = 13, Item 5 = 92\n   - Total items: Item 1 = 4, Item 2 = 5, Item 3 = 4, Item 4 = 1, Item 5 = 2\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.98.  This means that accepting an offer next round is worth 98% of its value this round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current Offer:** The current offer gives me [1, 3, 1, 0, 0]. This means I receive 1 unit of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5. The value of this offer to me is:\n     (1 * 24) + (3 * 7) + (1 * 17) + (0 * 13) + (0 * 92) = 24 + 21 + 17 + 0 + 0 = 62.\n\n   - **Comparison to Outside Offer:** The current offer (62) is significantly worse than my outside offer of 259. Therefore, accepting it would be a mistake.\n\n   - **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to calculate the value of various potential counteroffers, keeping in mind that my goal is to maximize my value while offering enough to Player 2 that they might accept.  Let's start by calculating my total possible value if I kept everything: (4 * 24) + (5 * 7) + (4 * 17) + (1 * 13) + (2 * 92) = 96 + 35 + 68 + 13 + 184 = 396.\n\n   -Let's also review the previous offers. I offered [0, 2, 0, 0, 0] which means I keep [4, 3, 4, 1, 2], for a value of (4*24) + (3*7) + (4*17) + (1*13) + (2*92) = 96 + 21 + 68 + 13 + 184 = 382. Player 2 then offered me [1, 3, 1, 0, 0], giving Player 2 [3, 2, 3, 1, 2].\n \n3) **Decision:**\n   - Since the current offer is much worse than my outside offer, I should not accept it.\n   - Walking away is a possibility, but there is still one round left, and I might be able to negotiate a better deal.\n   - I need to propose a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 259. Let's try giving the other player only the single unit of item 4. My offer would then be [0, 0, 0, 1, 0], and I would keep [4, 5, 4, 0, 2]. The value of my holdings would be (4*24) + (5*7) + (4*17) + (0*13) + (2*92) = 96 + 35 + 68 + 0 + 184 = 383.\n   -The previous counteroffer [0, 2, 0, 0, 0] was a good one. The player 2 offer shows that they value item 1 and 3. Let's increase my offer of item 2 to try to get them to lower their demands. A counteroffer of [0, 3, 0, 0, 0] means I hold [4, 2, 4, 1, 2], which has a value of (4*24) + (2*7) + (4*17) + (1*13) + (2*92) = 96 + 14 + 68 + 13 + 184 = 375. This would be higher than the offer they made in round 1 and better than my outside offer.\n\nTherefore, I will propose the counteroffer [0, 3, 0, 0, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 259. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 459 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value.

Since this is round 3, the discount factor will be 0.98^(3-1) = 0.98^2 = 0.9604.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [1, 4, 0, 0, 0]. This means I would get 1 unit of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.  My value would be: (1 * 24) + (4 * 7) + (0 * 17) + (0 * 13) + (0 * 92) = 24 + 28 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 52.\n    Considering the discount factor, the current offer's value is 52 * 0.9604 = 49.9408\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to propose a counteroffer to Player 2. To avoid mistakes, it must be better than my outside offer (259) *after applying the discount factor*. 259/0.9604=269.68. So, I need more than 269.68 from what I keep.

The value would be (2 * 92) + (4 * 24) + (2 * 17) = 184 + 96 + 34 = 314.\n    This exceeds the required 269.68 threshold.\n\n    *   Let's offer [0, 5, 2, 1, 0] to Player 2. I keep [4, 0, 2, 0, 2]. The value would be (4 * 24) + (0 * 7) + (2 * 17) + (0 * 13) + (2 * 92) = 96 + 0 + 34 + 0 + 184 = 314.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer (52 * 0.9604 = 49.9408) is much worse than my outside offer (259).

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 2177. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1095 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [7, 3, 9, 7, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    67 x 7 + 58 x 3 + 62 x 9 + 84 x 7 + 94 x 4\n    which is 2165 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 2177. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's start by analyzing the situation and planning my first move.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n   - My outside offer value is 2177.\n   - My values for the items are: item 1 = 67, item 2 = 58, item 3 = 62, item 4 = 84, item 5 = 94.\n   - The total pool of items is: item 1 = 7, item 2 = 4, item 3 = 9, item 4 = 7, item 5 = 4.\n   - The discount factor is 0.98. This means that offers accepted in later rounds are worth slightly less. However, since it's round 1, the discount isn't a major factor yet.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - Since there's no current offer, I need to consider potential counteroffers. I want to propose a division that gives me a value greater than my outside offer.\n   - I need to be mindful of the limits on the number of each item.\n\n3) **Develop a strategy:**\n\n   - I want to maximize my value, but I also need to make an offer that Player 2 might accept. I should aim for a fair split, but weighted towards my higher-value items.\n   - Since it's the first round, I have some room to start with a more aggressive offer and see how Player 2 responds.\n\nLet me try to construct a counteroffer. I will try to keep most of my high-value items (4 and 5) and give more of the lower-value items (1, 2, and 3) to Player 2. Let's try offering Player 2:\n\n*   Item 1: 4\n*   Item 2: 2\n*   Item 3: 5\n*   Item 4: 3\n*   Item 5: 2\n\nThis would leave me with:\n\n*   Item 1: 3\n*   Item 2: 2\n*   Item 3: 4\n*   Item 4: 4\n*   Item 5: 2\n\nMy value for this division would be:\n\n(3 * 67) + (2 * 58) + (4 * 62) + (4 * 84) + (2 * 94) = 201 + 116 + 248 + 336 + 188 = 1089\n\nThis is not better than my outside offer. Let's try another offer where I give Player 2:\n\n*   Item 1: 2\n*   Item 2: 1\n*   Item 3: 3\n*   Item 4: 2\n*   Item 5: 1\n\nThis would leave me with:\n\n*   Item 1: 5\n*   Item 2: 3\n*   Item 3: 6\n*   Item 4: 5\n*   Item 5: 3\n\nMy value for this division would be:\n\n(5 * 67) + (3 * 58) + (6 * 62) + (5 * 84) + (3 * 94) = 335 + 174 + 372 + 420 + 282 = 1583\n\nThis is still not better than my outside offer. I need to be a lot more aggressive. Let's try offering:\n\n*   Item 1: 1\n*   Item 2: 0\n*   Item 3: 2\n*   Item 4: 1\n*   Item 5: 0\n\nThis leaves me with:\n*   Item 1: 6\n*   Item 2: 4\n*   Item 3: 7\n*   Item 4: 6\n*   Item 5: 4\n\nMy value now is:\n\n(6 * 67) + (4 * 58) + (7 * 62) + (6 * 84) + (4 * 94) = 402 + 232 + 434 + 504 + 376 = 1948\n\nStill not good enough. Let's try offering:\n\n*   Item 1: 0\n*   Item 2: 0\n*   Item 3: 1\n*   Item 4: 0\n*   Item 5: 0\n\nThis leaves me with:\n*   Item 1: 7\n*   Item 2: 4\n*   Item 3: 8\n*   Item 4: 7\n*   Item 5: 4\n\nMy value now is:\n\n(7 * 67) + (4 * 58) + (8 * 62) + (7 * 84) + (4 * 94) = 469 + 232 + 496 + 588 + 376 = 2161\n\nStill below my outside offer. Let's try offering:\n*   Item 1: 0\n*   Item 2: 0\n*   Item 3: 0\n*   Item 4: 0\n*   Item 5: 0\n\nThis leaves me with:\n*   Item 1: 7\n*   Item 2: 4\n*   Item 3: 9\n*   Item 4: 7\n*   Item 5: 4\n\nMy value now is:\n\n(7 * 67) + (4 * 58) + (9 * 62) + (7 * 84) + (4 * 94) = 469 + 232 + 558 + 588 + 376 = 2223\n\nThis is better than my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

This means an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.98 times its face value to me.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [2, 1, 2, 4, 4]. This means I would have:\n    *   Item 1: 2 units * 67 = 134\n    *   Item 2: 1 unit * 58 = 58\n    *   Item 3: 2 units * 62 = 124\n    *   Item 4: 4 units * 84 = 336\n    *   Item 5: 4 units * 94 = 376\n    *   Total value of current offer: 134 + 58 + 124 + 336 + 376 = 1028\n    *   Discounted value of current offer: 1028 * 0.98 = 1007.44\n    *   This is less than my outside offer value of 2177.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find an offer that is better than my outside offer when discounted. Since it's round 2, any accepted offer is multiplied by 0.98. Let's see how much the total number of items is worth to me:\n    7 * 67 + 4 * 58 + 9 * 62 + 7 * 84 + 4 * 94 = 469 + 232 + 558 + 588 + 376 = 2223\n\n    I need to get at least 2177/0.98 = 2221.43 worth of items to make accepting better than walking away.\n    Since all of the items are worth 2223, any split where player 2 gets more than 1.57 worth of items is worth less than walking away.\n\n    Let's consider some counteroffers. I want to keep as many of the most valuable items (item 5 and item 4) as possible. What if I gave them 1 of item 1, none of item 2, none of item 3, none of item 4, and none of item 5:\n    Keeping: 6 * 67 + 4 * 58 + 9 * 62 + 7 * 84 + 4 * 94 = 402 + 232 + 558 + 588 + 376 = 2156\n\n    Giving them [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]:\n    Keeping: 6 * 67 + 4 * 58 + 9 * 62 + 7 * 84 + 4 * 94 = 402 + 232 + 558 + 588 + 376 = 2156\n    2156 * 0.98 = 2112.88, this is less than my outside offer.\n\n    Giving them [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]:\n    Keeping: 7 * 67 + 4 * 58 + 9 * 62 + 7 * 84 + 4 * 94 = 469 + 232 + 558 + 588 + 376 = 2223\n    2223 * 0.98 = 2178.54, this is greater than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer (even discounted) is less than my outside offer, so I should not accept.\n*   I believe offering them nothing and accepting in round 3 is my optimal move.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 8, 6, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party.

This means waiting reduces the value of any potential deal by 2% per round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** We need to explore potential counteroffers to find a good balance between giving enough to Player 2 to make them accept, while still keeping enough value for ourselves. Since it's the first round, and there's no offer to react to, it is best to start with a reasonable offer that's likely to be accepted rather than an extreme offer that could prolong negotiations unnecessarily.\n\n3) **Decision-making:**\n\nSince there is no offer, I need to make an initial offer. I will start by offering roughly half of the items to Player 2. I will adjust the amounts based on item value, offering relatively more of items with lower value to me.\n\nLet's consider an offer where I give Player 2:\n*   Item 1: 1\n*   Item 2: 3\n*   Item 3: 4\n*   Item 4: 2\n*   Item 5: 1\n\nThis means I keep:\n*   Item 1: 1\n*   Item 2: 2\n*   Item 3: 5\n*   Item 4: 3\n*   Item 5: 2\n\nMy value for this division would be:\n(1 * 70) + (2 * 18) + (5 * 72) + (3 * 87) + (2 * 33) = 70 + 36 + 360 + 261 + 66 = 793\n\nThis is significantly higher than my outside offer of 432. Let's refine this offer by giving Player 2 more, but still staying above my outside offer. I aim to offer about half the total value of all items (1412), so about 700.\n\nLet's try:\n*   Item 1: 1\n*   Item 2: 3\n*   Item 3: 5\n*   Item 4: 3\n*   Item 5: 1\n\nThis means I keep:\n*   Item 1: 1\n*   Item 2: 2\n*   Item 3: 4\n*   Item 4: 2\n*   Item 5: 2\n\nMy value: (1 * 70) + (2 * 18) + (4 * 72) + (2 * 87) + (2 * 33) = 70 + 36 + 288 + 174 + 66 = 634\nThis is still above 432, a safe start.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 3, 5, 3, 1]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 188. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 573 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 2, 3, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    43 x 0 + 76 x 0 + 29 x 2 + 21 x 3 + 22 x 3\n    which is 187 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 188. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 5, 3, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 3, 5, 3, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "I'll analyze this negotiation step by step.\n\n1) Current situation:\n   - My outside offer value: 188\n   - My item values: Item 1: 43, Item 2: 76, Item 3: 29, Item 4: 21, Item 5: 22\n   - Total pool: Item 1: 2 units, Item 2: 5 units, Item 3: 9 units, Item 4: 5 units, Item 5: 3 units\n   - Discount factor: 0.98 (reduces value by 2% each round)\n\n2) Assess current offer's value:\n   If I accept [1, 3, 5, 3, 1], I would get:\n   - 1 unit of item 1: 1 \u00d7 43 = 43\n   - 3 units of item 2: 3 \u00d7 76 = 228\n   - 5 units of item 3: 5 \u00d7 29 = 145\n   - 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 21 = 63\n   - 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 22 = 22\n   Total value: 501\n\n   This is much better than my outside offer of 188.\n\n3) Consider potential counteroffers:\n   Let me evaluate a counteroffer where I keep more high-value items.\n   If I offer [1, 1, 6, 3, 2] to Player 1, I would keep:\n   - 1 unit of item 1: 1 \u00d7 43 = 43\n   - 4 units of item 2: 4 \u00d7 76 = 304\n   - 3 units of item 3: 3 \u00d7 29 = 87\n   - 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 21 = 42\n   - 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 22 = 22\n   Total value: 498\n\n   This is still much better than my outside offer, but slightly less than accepting the current offer.\n\n4) Decision:\n   The current offer gives me a value of 501, which is significantly better than my outside offer of 188. \n   \n   While I could counteroffer to try to get more value, the current offer is already quite good for me given my item values. Player 1 is giving me 3 of 5 units of item 2, which is my most valuable item at 76 per unit.\n   \n   Since we're in round 1 and accepting now gives me full value without discount, and this offer is already quite favorable, I'll accept.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",
