I am Player 1, and I want to maximize my discounted value from this negotiation, keeping in mind my outside offer of 505.\n\nSince there is no current offer on the table, I need to make an initial offer. I will try to estimate what Player 2 might value these items at, and make an offer that is likely to be accepted but still gives me a good portion of the value. Since the values are drawn from a uniform distribution between 1 and 101, a reasonable guess for Player 2's value is the middle point, roughly 50. I want to offer Player 2 enough so they will accept but keep as much for myself as possible.\nA good strategy is to aim for an almost even split, and tilt the distribution in my favour using the items I value less.\n\nLet's try offering Player 2 the following:\nItem 1: 2 units\nItem 2: 1 unit\nItem 3: 1 unit\nItem 4: 1 unit\nItem 5: 2 units\n\nThis leaves me with:\nItem 1: 2 units, value = 2 * 98 = 196\nItem 2: 2 units, value = 2 * 37 = 74\nItem 3: 1 unit, value = 1 * 93 = 93\nItem 4: 1 unit, value = 1 * 2 = 2\nItem 5: 3 units, value = 3 * 38 = 114\nTotal value for me: 196 + 74 + 93 + 2 + 114 = 479\n\nSince 479 < 505 (my outside offer), I need to improve my offer to Player 2 to make this worthwhile.\n\nHow about:\nItem 1: 1 unit\nItem 2: 0 unit\nItem 3: 0 unit\nItem 4: 0 unit\nItem 5: 0 unit\n\nThis offer is clearly too low and is likely to be rejected. I need to give Player 2 something to be even remotely considered.\n\nLet's try to make an offer that gets me more than 505 in value, and is also relatively fair. How about this:\n\nOffer Player 2:\nItem 1: 1 unit\nItem 2: 1 unit\nItem 3: 1 unit\nItem 4: 1 unit\nItem 5: 2 unit\n\nThis leaves me with:\nItem 1: 3 units * 98 = 294\nItem 2: 2 units * 37 = 74\nItem 3: 1 units * 93 = 93\nItem 4: 1 units * 2 = 2\nItem 5: 3 units * 38 = 114\nMy Total Value = 294 + 74 + 93 + 2 + 114 = 577\n\nSince 577 > 505, this offer would be better than walking away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 2]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 2, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    94 x 0 + 96 x 1 + 77 x 0 + 53 x 2 + 61 x 3\n    which is 385 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 386. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. I'm Player 1, and I have the following values per item unit:\n- Item 1: 64\n- Item 2: 10\n- Item 3: 56\n- Item 4: 42\n- Item 5: 70\n\nTotal units available:\n- Item 1: 6\n- Item 2: 4\n- Item 3: 4\n- Item 4: 7\n- Item 5: 4\n\nMy outside offer is 873. My goal is to maximize my discounted value.\n\nSince there's no offer on the table, I need to make an initial offer. I need to figure out what offer is likely to be accepted by Player 2, or at least lead to a better outcome for me than my outside offer.\n\nLet's consider an equal split as a starting point.  This would be:\n- Item 1: 3\n- Item 2: 2\n- Item 3: 2\n- Item 4: 3.5\n- Item 5: 2\n\nSince I can't offer half units, I will round down the 3.5 to 3, and give Player 2 that amount. So:\n- Item 1: 3 units to Player 2 (3 for me)\n- Item 2: 2 units to Player 2 (2 for me)\n- Item 3: 2 units to Player 2 (2 for me)\n- Item 4: 3 units to Player 2 (4 for me)\n- Item 5: 2 units to Player 2 (2 for me)\n\nMy value for this offer:\n- 3 * 64 = 192\n- 2 * 10 = 20\n- 2 * 56 = 112\n- 4 * 42 = 168\n- 2 * 70 = 140\nTotal value = 192 + 20 + 112 + 168 + 140 = 632\n\nThis is less than my outside offer of 873.  I need to offer Player 2 more to reach a deal, or risk walking away and getting 873.\n\nLet's try offering Player 2 slightly more than half, aiming to get a deal in round 1 with a good chance of success. Let's start by offering them slightly more than half the valuable items, and less than half the less valuable items.\n\n- Item 1: 4 units to Player 2 (2 for me): 2 * 64 = 128\n- Item 2: 3 units to Player 2 (1 for me): 1 * 10 = 10\n- Item 3: 3 units to Player 2 (1 for me): 1 * 56 = 56\n- Item 4: 4 units to Player 2 (3 for me): 3 * 42 = 126\n- Item 5: 3 units to Player 2 (1 for me): 1 * 70 = 70\n\nTotal value to me: 128 + 10 + 56 + 126 + 70 = 390. This is too low.\n\nSince my outside offer is 873, I need to get close to that to make the negotiation worthwhile. Given the discount factor, waiting to round 2 only reduces my final value.\nLet's try to make a relatively generous offer, slightly favoring myself, and hopefully convincing player 2 to accept. I will iterate and adjust based on a better understanding of player 2's valuation:\n\n- Item 1: 3 units to Player 2 (3 for me): 3 * 64 = 192\n- Item 2: 1 units to Player 2 (3 for me): 3 * 10 = 30\n- Item 3: 1 units to Player 2 (3 for me): 3 * 56 = 168\n- Item 4: 3 units to Player 2 (4 for me): 4 * 42 = 168\n- Item 5: 1 units to Player 2 (3 for me): 3 * 70 = 210\n\nTotal Value: 192 + 30 + 168 + 168 + 210 = 768. Still less than 873. Let's try and push it.\n\n- Item 1: 2 units to Player 2 (4 for me): 4 * 64 = 256\n- Item 2: 1 units to Player 2 (3 for me): 3 * 10 = 30\n- Item 3: 1 units to Player 2 (3 for me): 3 * 56 = 168\n- Item 4: 2 units to Player 2 (5 for me): 5 * 42 = 210\n- Item 5: 1 units to Player 2 (3 for me): 3 * 70 = 210\n\nTotal Value: 256 + 30 + 168 + 210 + 210 = 874. Okay, this is close enough, I think.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 1, 2, 1]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 2, 2, 6, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    81 x 2 + 64 x 2 + 88 x 2 + 23 x 6 + 46 x 4\n    which is 788 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 789. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 1, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 1, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

I should consider making a counteroffer. Let's think what Player 2 wants and if I can make them happy without sacrificing too much.\n\nIf Player 2 offered [2, 1, 1, 2, 1] in round 1, it means they value the items similarly to me. Player 2 is keeping the majority of each item with this offer, however, they may be expecting a fair deal.\n\nLet's construct a counteroffer. I'll keep 4 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5. This means offering Player 2: [2, 2, 2, 3, 2]\n\nMy value for this split is:\n(4 * 64) + (2 * 10) + (2 * 56) + (4 * 42) + (2 * 70) = 256 + 20 + 112 + 168 + 140 = 696\nDiscounted, this is 696 * 0.98 = 682.08\n\nThis value, however, is still less than my outside option of 873. Since we are in Round 2 and the negotiation ends after round 3, it may be my last opportunity to achieve a beneficial outcome. I will make one final counteroffer.\n\nI will offer Player 2 slightly more items, giving Player 2: [2, 1, 1, 3, 3]. This means I keep:\n* Item 1: 6 - 2 = 4 units\n* Item 2: 4 - 1 = 3 units\n* Item 3: 4 - 1 = 3 units\n* Item 4: 7 - 3 = 4 units\n* Item 5: 4 - 3 = 1 units\n\nMy value would be:\n(4 * 64) + (3 * 10) + (3 * 56) + (4 * 42) + (1 * 70) = 256 + 30 + 168 + 168 + 70 = 692\n\nThis discounted is 692 * 0.98 = 678.16, less than my outside option of 873. Therefore, in principle I should walk. However, the difference is shrinking.\n\nThe current offer on the table of [2,1,1,2,1] is valued at 341.04 discounted.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 789. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 906 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 2, 2, 6, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    81 x 2 + 64 x 2 + 88 x 2 + 23 x 6 + 46 x 4\n    which is 788 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 789. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 1, 2, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 1, 1, 2, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 2, 3, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 2, 2, 3, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 1, 0, 5, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    72 x 5 + 4 x 1 + 21 x 0 + 31 x 5 + 91 x 2\n    which is 701 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 702. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [4, 3, 2, 3, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [4, 3, 2, 3, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the current situation\n- **Outside offer value**: My outside offer value is 702.\n- **Values of the items**:\n  - Item 1: 72 per unit\n  - Item 2: 4 per unit\n  - Item 3: 21 per unit\n  - Item 4: 31 per unit\n  - Item 5: 91 per unit\n- **Total pool of items**:\n  - 7 units of item 1\n  - 5 units of item 2\n  - 4 units of item 3\n  - 6 units of item 4\n  - 2 units of item 5\n- **Discount factor influence**: The discount factor (gamma = 0.98) means that the value of an agreement decreases slightly the longer negotiations take. However, my primary concern is comparing the total value of offers to my outside offer, rather than factoring in the discount just yet because it's only round 1.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the value of offers\n- **Current offer as Player 1 offers [4, 3, 2, 3, 1]**:\n  - I would keep [3, 2, 2, 3, 1] with values:\n    - Item 1: 3 \u00d7 72 = 216\n    - Item 2: 2 \u00d7 4 = 8\n    - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 21 = 42\n    - Item 4: 3 \u00d7 31 = 93\n    - Item 5: 1 \u00d7 91 = 91\n  - Total value = 216 + 8 + 42 + 93 + 91 = 450\n\nSince the total value from accepting the current offer, 450, is less than my outside offer value of 702, accepting this would be suboptimal for me.\n\n### Step 3: Make a decision\n- **Accept the current offer?** No, as the value is less than the outside offer.\n- **Walk away?** Not yet, since it's only round 1 and negotiation could still yield a better result.\n- **Propose a counteroffer?** Yes, I should find a division that provides higher value than my outside offer of 702.\n\nTo propose a counteroffer, I need to ensure the value to me is greater than 702. Let's test a scenario where I keep more of the high-value items (especially item 1 and item 5) and assess:\n\n- Offer something like: [2, 3, 4, 2, 0], keeping [5, 2, 0, 4, 2]:\n  - Item 1: 5 \u00d7 72 = 360\n  - Item 2: 2 \u00d7 4 = 8\n  - Item 3: 0 \u00d7 21 = 0\n  - Item 4: 4 \u00d7 31 = 124\n  - Item 5: 2 \u00d7 91 = 182\n  - Total value = 360 + 8 + 0 + 124 + 182 = 674\n\nThis scenario still results in a value (674) less than the outside offer (702), so I need to adjust further.\n\nLet's adjust even more favorably: [1, 4, 4, 1, 0], keeping [6, 1, 0, 5, 2]:\n- Item 1: 6 \u00d7 72 = 432\n- Item 2: 1 \u00d7 4 = 4\n- Item 3: 0 \u00d7 21 = 0\n- Item 4: 5 \u00d7 31 = 155\n- Item 5: 2 \u00d7 91 = 182\n- Total value = 432 + 4 + 0 + 155 + 182 = 773\n\nThis value is above my outside offer (702), and thus a better option.\n\nTherefore, my action is to propose a counteroffer:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 4, 4, 1, 0]}\n```",

The discounted value would be multiplied by 0.98.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer [2, 1, 0, 2, 0]:**\n  - Value calculation:\n    - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 72 = 144\n    - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 4 = 4\n    - 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 21 = 0\n    - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 31 = 62\n    - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 91 = 0\n  - Total value (before discount) = 144 + 4 + 0 + 62 + 0 = 210\n  - Discounted value = 210 \u00d7 0.98 = 205.8\n\n  - Since 205.8 is less than my outside offer of 702, the current offer is not worth accepting.\n\n- **Evaluate Potential Counteroffers:**\n  Let's propose an offer where the value to me must be greater than 702.\n\n  Proposed Counteroffer: [2, 0, 0, 2, 1] (offering to Player 1, so I keep [5, 5, 4, 4, 1])\n  - My value:\n    - 5 units of item 1 = 5 \u00d7 72 = 360 \n    - 5 units of item 2 = 5 \u00d7 4 = 20\n    - 4 units of item 3 = 4 \u00d7 21 = 84\n    - 4 units of item 4 = 4 \u00d7 31 = 124\n    - 1 units of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 91 = 91\n  - Total value = 360 + 20 + 84 + 124 + 91 = 679\n  - Discounted value = 679 \u00d7 0.98 = 665.42\n\n  This counteroffer does not meet my outside offer value of 702, so I must adjust the offer.\n\n  Adjusted Counteroffer: [2, 0, 0, 1, 0] (offering to Player 1, so I keep [5, 5, 4, 5, 2])\n  - My value:\n    - 5 units of item 1 = 5 \u00d7 72 = 360 \n    - 5 units of item 2 = 5 \u00d7 4 = 20\n    - 4 units of item 3 = 4 \u00d7 21 = 84\n    - 5 units of item 4 = 5 \u00d7 31 = 155\n    - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 91 = 182\n  - Total value = 360 + 20 + 84 + 155 + 182 = 801\n  - Discounted value = 801 \u00d7 0.98 = 784.98\n   \n  Therefore, this corrected counteroffer is better than my outside offer.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\n- The current offer from Player 1 is worse than my outside offer.\n- My adjusted counteroffer is better than my outside offer.\n\nGiven this analysis, I should propose this specific counteroffer to maximize my value in the negotiation.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 0, 1, 0]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 1, 4, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    21 x 0 + 96 x 2 + 66 x 1 + 44 x 4 + 5 x 1\n    which is 439 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 440. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    16 x 0 + 84 x 1 + 22 x 0 + 80 x 1 + 15 x 0\n    which is 164 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 165. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 4, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 4, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Let's go through the analysis step by step:\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value: 165\n   - My private values for the items:\n     - Item 1: 16\n     - Item 2: 84\n     - Item 3: 22\n     - Item 4: 80\n     - Item 5: 15\n   - Total pool of items:\n     - 2 units of item 1\n     - 4 units of item 2\n     - 7 units of item 3\n     - 3 units of item 4\n     - 3 units of item 5\n   - Discount factor: 0.98. This influences the value by reducing the effective value of offers in future rounds. Since this is only round 1, the value is not yet discounted.\n\n2) Assess the value of the current offer:\n   - Player 1's offer to me: [1, 2, 4, 1, 1]\n   - My total value if I accept the current offer:\n     - 1 unit of item 1: 1 \u00d7 16 = 16\n     - 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 84 = 168\n     - 4 units of item 3: 4 \u00d7 22 = 88\n     - 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 80 = 80\n     - 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 15 = 15\n     - Total value = 16 + 168 + 88 + 80 + 15 = 367\n\n   - Compare to my outside offer value: 165\n   \n   The current offer of 367 is significantly higher than my outside offer of 165.\n\n3) Decision:\n   - Should I accept the current offer? Yes, because the offer gives me a value of 367, which is well above my outside offer of 165.\n   - Thus, I avoid Mistakes 2, 4, and 5 by making sure I do not accept an offer worse than my outside offer and by not walking away from a better offer.\n\nGiven the analysis, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 3, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    37 x 4 + 12 x 3 + 64 x 0 + 38 x 0 + 53 x 0\n    which is 184 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 185. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

This leaves Player 2 with 2 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the current offer to me:\n(0 * 11) + (0 * 95) + (0 * 74) + (4 * 81) + (0 * 60) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 324 + 0 = 324.\nSince this is round 2, we need to discount this value by gamma^(r-1) = 0.98^(2-1) = 0.98.\nSo, the discounted value of the current offer to me is 324 * 0.98 = 317.52.\n\nNow, let's calculate the value of Player 2's allocation:\n(2 * 11) + (5 * 95) + (3 * 74) + (0 * 81) + (0 * 60) = 22 + 475 + 222 + 0 + 0 = 719.\nAgain, discounting the value by gamma^(r-1) = 0.98^(2-1) = 0.98.\nSo, the discounted value of Player 2's allocation is 719 * 0.98 = 704.62.\n\nMy outside offer is 234. Since 317.52 > 234, accepting the current offer is better than walking away *at this point*.\nLet's compare to Player 1's original offer [1, 2, 1, 2, 0]. The value of this offer to me is:\n(1 * 11) + (2 * 95) + (1 * 74) + (2 * 81) + (0 * 60) = 11 + 190 + 74 + 162 + 0 = 437.\nThe discounted value is 437 * 0.98 = 428.26.\nThe value to player 2 would have been:\n(1 * 11) + (3 * 95) + (2 * 74) + (2 * 81) + (0 * 60) = 11 + 285 + 148 + 162 = 606.\nThe discounted value is 606 * 0.98 = 593.88.\n\nNow consider rejecting the current offer, and making a counteroffer. We're in round 2, there is only one round left.\nI could offer to give player 2 [0,1,0,0,0], keeping [2,4,3,4,0]\nValue to me would be (2 * 11) + (4 * 95) + (3 * 74) + (4 * 81) + (0 * 60) = 22 + 380 + 222 + 324 = 948.\ndiscounted value = 948 * 0.98 = 929.04\nValue to Player 2 would be 95*1 = 95. Discounted value = 95 * 0.98 = 93.1\n\nAlternatively I can give player 2 something similar to the original offer. [1,2,1,2,0]\nThen the value to me = 437, Discounted value = 428.26\nThe value to Player 2 = 606, Discounted value = 593.88.\n\nIf I offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], this would yield (2*11) + (5*95) + (3*74) + (4*81) = 22+475+222+324 = 1043.\nThis is the maximum. However, it is unlikely to be accepted. Discounted value = 1043 * 0.98 = 1022.14\n\nSince I have a guaranteed outside option of 234. I believe the optimal solution is to propose a counteroffer of giving as little as possible.\nTherefore, I will offer the same as Player 1's original offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 1, 2, 0]}\n```",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 273. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 273. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 393 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 5, 1, 4, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    13 x 0 + 16 x 5 + 15 x 1 + 43 x 4 + 44 x 0\n    which is 267 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 273. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 1, 2, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 4, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 1, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 1, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

My valuation for this offer is (0 * 11) + (0 * 95) + (1 * 74) + (0 * 81) + (0 * 60) = 74.\n\n2.  **Consider my outside offer:** My outside offer is worth 234.\n\n3.  **Discount factor:** Since it's round 3, the discount factor is 0.98^(3-1) = 0.98^2 = 0.9604.\n\n4.  **Adjusted value of the current offer:** The present value of accepting the current offer is 74 * 0.9604 = 71.0696.\n\n5.  **Compare to outside offer:** 71.0696 < 234, so accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\n6.  **Consider a counteroffer:** I need to decide if there's a counteroffer that I would find acceptable and that Player 2 might also accept. Given this is the last round, it is unlikely I can find such offer. Let's see, giving everything to the other player would give them:\n    *   Item 1: 2 * v\\_1(player2)\n    *   Item 2: 5 * v\\_2(player2)\n    *   Item 3: 3 * v\\_3(player2)\n    *   Item 4: 4 * v\\_4(player2)\n    *   Item 5: 0 * v\\_5(player2)\n    This is unknown, but, they are offering almost nothing to me and likely have a higher outside offer. I need to get over 234/0.9604 = 243.648 to be happy, and I'm keeping the total value of these items. I have 2 items of item 1, 5 items of item 2, 3 items of item 3, 4 items of item 4, and 0 of item 5. So, 2 * 11 + 5 * 95 + 3 * 74 + 4 * 81 = 22 + 475 + 222 + 324 = 1043. They are currently offering me 74/0.9604, or giving me about 77 of my total value. Since they seem to be unwilling to give much away, I am unlikely to find a beneficial agreement.\n\n7.  **Make a decision:** Since the adjusted value of the current offer is less than my outside offer, and it's the last round, I should walk away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 61. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 684 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 3, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    97 x 0 + 8 x 0 + 6 x 3 + 42 x 1 + 75 x 0\n    which is 60 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 61. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

A reasonable assumption is they will want at least some minimum value.\n2.  **What's the most generous offer I can make while still exceeding my outside offer?**\n\n**Calculations**\n\nMy total value for all items is: (3 * 63) + (5 * 58) + (3 * 45) + (5 * 6) + (6 * 64) = 189 + 290 + 135 + 30 + 384 = 1028\n\nI need to keep enough items so that my value is at least 499.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 1, 5, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    12 x 0 + 77 x 3 + 40 x 1 + 4 x 5 + 81 x 6\n    which is 777 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 779. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 1, 2, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 1, 2, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

If I gave them back something close to their request of Item 1 and 5, then I could potentially take most of Item 2, 3, and 4.\n\nI have the following available:\nItem 1: 3\nItem 2: 5\nItem 3: 3\nItem 4: 5\nItem 5: 6\n\nI will offer [0, 3, 1, 3, 5] to Player 2.\n\nThis means I keep:\nItem 1: 3\nItem 2: 2\nItem 3: 2\nItem 4: 2\nItem 5: 1\n\nMy value will be:\n(3 * 63) + (2 * 58) + (2 * 45) + (2 * 6) + (1 * 64) = 189 + 116 + 90 + 12 + 64 = 471\n\nDiscounted value: 471 * 0.98 = 461.58\n\nEven with this, it is still less than my outside offer. It is better than their current offer though, at 247.94. So they may accept.\nIn the interest of keeping all options open, I will present this offer to them.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 1, 3, 5]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 779. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 642 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 1, 5, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    12 x 0 + 77 x 3 + 40 x 1 + 4 x 5 + 81 x 6\n    which is 777 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 779. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 1, 2, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 0, 0, 0, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 3, 1, 3, 5]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 3, 1, 3, 5]\n\n    What is your action?

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 3, 4, 10] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    43 x 0 + 81 x 0 + 22 x 3 + 20 x 4 + 16 x 10\n    which is 306 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 307. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Since 462.56 is much lower than 1311, I should not accept this offer.\n\nLet's consider making a counteroffer. My goal is to get an offer that's worth more than 1311 / 0.98 = 1337.76 to me in the final round.\n\nI have the following items to distribute:\n*   Item 1: 8 units, value 14 each\n*   Item 2: 5 units, value 51 each\n*   Item 3: 3 units, value 20 each\n*   Item 4: 4 units, value 67 each\n*   Item 5: 10 units, value 69 each\nTotal value if I keep everything = 8 * 14 + 5 * 51 + 3 * 20 + 4 * 67 + 10 * 69 = 112 + 255 + 60 + 268 + 690 = 1385\n\nI need to make an offer that will give me a discounted value greater than 1311. Thus the value to me after discounting should be greater than 1311/0.98 which equals approximately 1337.76. Before discounting, the value needs to be 1337.76/0.98 which equals approximately 1365.06. Let's consider offering Player 2 only the items that I value the least. I value item 1 at 14 and item 3 at 20. I have 8 units of item 1 and 3 units of item 3. Let's offer Player 2 all units of item 1 and all units of item 3, and one unit of item 2.\n\nCounteroffer: [8, 1, 3, 0, 0]\nThis would leave me with:\n*   Item 1: 0 units\n*   Item 2: 4 units\n*   Item 3: 0 units\n*   Item 4: 4 units\n*   Item 5: 10 units\nMy value: 4 * 51 + 4 * 67 + 10 * 69 = 204 + 268 + 690 = 1162\nThis is less than 1365.06. So I need to increase my offer to player 2 to make it worthwhile for them to accept.\nLet's try offering player 2 everything but the item I value most. Player 2 will get items 1,3,4. We will give them nothing for item 5 and item 2.\nI will consider giving them [8,0,3,4,0].\nValue left for me:\n*   Item 1: 0 units\n*   Item 2: 5 units\n*   Item 3: 0 units\n*   Item 4: 0 units\n*   Item 5: 10 units\nMy value = 5*51 + 10*69 = 255 + 690 = 945\nThis is still way too low. It needs to be greater than 1337.76/0.98 which equals approximately 1365.06.\nI will try and maximize my offer to them and offer them everything and see what I get. I value item 4 the most at 67. So I will keep only item 4 and give everything else to them.\nMy offer to Player 2 will be [8,5,3,0,10]\nValue for me will be only item 4 = 4 * 67 = 268. Discounted is 268 * 0.98 = 262.64.\nI will just walk.\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n",

If we reach round 3 and Player 2 makes a counteroffer, it's treated as a walk.\n*   **Information:** My values for each item: 63, 33, 52, 24, 9. My outside offer: 89. Available quantities: 4, 3, 6, 3, 7.\n\n**Strategy**\n\nSince it's the first round, I need to make an initial offer. I want to make an offer that is high enough to be attractive to player 2, but still leaves me with a good amount of value.\n\nI need to consider what a reasonable split might look like. A simple starting point might be an even split. Let's consider giving Player 2 half of each item where possible:\n\n*   Item 1: 2 units\n*   Item 2: 1 unit\n*   Item 3: 3 units\n*   Item 4: 1 unit\n*   Item 5: 3 units\n\nValue to Player 2 (using unknown Player 2 values): We can't know this exactly, but this offer is reasonable in terms of quantity given to them.\nValue to Me:\n\n*   Item 1: (4-2) * 63 = 2 * 63 = 126\n*   Item 2: (3-1) * 33 = 2 * 33 = 66\n*   Item 3: (6-3) * 52 = 3 * 52 = 156\n*   Item 4: (3-1) * 24 = 2 * 24 = 48\n*   Item 5: (7-3) * 9 = 4 * 9 = 36\n\nTotal Value to me = 126 + 66 + 156 + 48 + 36 = 432.\nThis is way higher than my outside option, so I have a lot of flexibility here.\n\nLet's try a slightly more aggressive offer (more for me):\n\n*   Item 1: 1 unit\n*   Item 2: 1 unit\n*   Item 3: 2 units\n*   Item 4: 1 unit\n*   Item 5: 2 units\n\nValue to Player 2 (using unknown Player 2 values): We can't know this exactly.\nValue to Me:\n\n*   Item 1: (4-1) * 63 = 3 * 63 = 189\n*   Item 2: (3-1) * 33 = 2 * 33 = 66\n*   Item 3: (6-2) * 52 = 4 * 52 = 208\n*   Item 4: (3-1) * 24 = 2 * 24 = 48\n*   Item 5: (7-2) * 9 = 5 * 9 = 45\n\nTotal Value to me = 189 + 66 + 208 + 48 + 45 = 556.\nThis is much more appealing.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 3, 3, 1, 7] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    75 x 3 + 60 x 3 + 82 x 3 + 28 x 1 + 90 x 7\n    which is 1309 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1310. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 2, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 2, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

So, accepting the offer is better than walking away right now. However, let's consider making a counteroffer.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 3, 3, 1, 7] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    75 x 3 + 60 x 3 + 82 x 3 + 28 x 1 + 90 x 7\n    which is 1309 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1310. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 2, 1, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 3, 0, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 2, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 2, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

I have no current offer on the table, so I can either walk away or make an initial offer. My outside offer is 381. I want to maximize my expected value, taking into account the discount factor in future rounds.\n\nSince it's the first round, I should try to make a reasonable offer that Player 2 might accept. This is better than walking away immediately. To determine a good starting offer, let's consider a fair split of the total value. Player 2's values are unknown, but I can assume that, on average, their values are similar to mine. Therefore, giving Player 2 approximately half of the total value should be a good starting point.\n\nMy total value is (5 * 2) + (5 * 55) + (2 * 1) + (2 * 4) + (7 * 17) = 10 + 275 + 2 + 8 + 119 = 414.\n\nLet's aim for an offer that gives Player 2 slightly *more* than half the total value, to make acceptance more likely. This might be around 220-230 of value to Player 2 if they had similar valuations to me. Since their valuations are unknown and could be much higher for some items, let's make an offer where Player 2 gets generous amounts of the goods, so I am very likely to achieve more than 381 discounted value.\n\nI will make the following initial offer, and see what comes back:\nItem 1: 3 units to Player 2 (keeping 2 for myself)\nItem 2: 3 units to Player 2 (keeping 2 for myself)\nItem 3: 1 unit to Player 2 (keeping 1 for myself)\nItem 4: 1 unit to Player 2 (keeping 1 for myself)\nItem 5: 4 units to Player 2 (keeping 3 for myself)\n\nValue of offer for Player 1 is:\n(2 * 2) + (2 * 55) + (1 * 1) + (1 * 4) + (3 * 17) = 4 + 110 + 1 + 4 + 51 = 170\nIf this is rejected, in round 2, my target must be (381/0.98)= 388.77\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 3, 1, 1, 4]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 450. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1098 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 0, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    95 x 1 + 92 x 1 + 48 x 0 + 46 x 2 + 85 x 2\n    which is 449 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 450. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 3, 1, 1, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 3, 1, 1, 4]\n\n    What is your action?

Since 21.56 is much less than 647, accepting this offer is a bad idea.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. I need to figure out what a reasonable counteroffer might be. Looking at the history, Player 1 initially offered Player 2 [1, 2, 2, 3, 2]. Then, Player 2 countered with [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This suggests Player 2 values item 1 much more highly than other items, or doesn't value the others very much at all.\n\nI want to maximize my gain, and I know Player 2 values item 1 highly. Let's consider offering Player 2 all of item 1, and then some of the other items that I value less highly, perhaps item 5.\n\nIf I offer Player 2 [2, 0, 0, 0, 0], then I keep [0, 5, 5, 6, 4].\nMy value would be:\n0 * 22 + 5 * 77 + 5 * 59 + 6 * 97 + 4 * 42 = 0 + 385 + 295 + 582 + 168 = 1430\nThe discounted value is 1430 * 0.98 = 1401.4\nThis is significantly larger than my outside offer.\n\nLet's consider offering Player 2 [2, 0, 0, 0, 4].\nThen I keep [0, 5, 5, 6, 0].\nMy value would be:\n0 * 22 + 5 * 77 + 5 * 59 + 6 * 97 + 0 * 42 = 0 + 385 + 295 + 582 + 0 = 1262\nDiscounted Value is 1262 * 0.98 = 1236.76\n\nLet's offer something in between, giving up only a little more of Item 4 to see if they bite.\nLet's try offering Player 2 [2, 0, 0, 3, 0]. Then I would keep [0, 5, 5, 3, 4].\nMy value would be:\n0 * 22 + 5 * 77 + 5 * 59 + 3 * 97 + 4 * 42 = 0 + 385 + 295 + 291 + 168 = 1139\nThe discounted value is 1139 * 0.98 = 1116.22\n\nCompared to 647, that is still very attractive.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 5, 1, 6, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    60 x 0 + 91 x 5 + 36 x 1 + 54 x 6 + 66 x 4\n    which is 1079 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1081. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 2, 3, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 0, 3, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 0, 0, 3, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

So, we need to improve this further in the next attempt.\n\nConsider a more aggressive offer:\n- **I keep:** [1, 5, 5, 4, 3] and offer [1, 0, 0, 2, 1] to Player 1.\n  - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 60 = 60\n  - 5 units of item 2 = 5 \u00d7 91 = 455\n  - 5 units of item 3 = 5 \u00d7 36 = 180\n  - 4 units of item 4 = 4 \u00d7 54 = 216\n  - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198\n  - **Total value for me:** 60 + 455 + 180 + 216 + 198 = 1109\n\n1109 is greater than my outside offer of 1081.

Since this is the last round, Player 2 might be willing to concede more.\n\nI will make a counteroffer that gives Player 2 just enough to potentially accept. The earlier offers from Player 2 seem to indicate they value item 1 and 4 the most. \n\nSince it's the last round, I should make a relatively generous counteroffer but still aim for a deal above my outside option: I will offer Player 2 one unit of item 1 and two units of item 4. This means, I will keep item 1:1, item 2:5, item 3:5, item 4:4, and item 5:4\n\nMy value in that case would be: 1 * 22 + 5 * 77 + 5 * 59 + 4 * 97 + 4 * 42 = 22 + 385 + 295 + 388 + 168 = 1258\n\nThe discounted value would then be: 1258 * 0.9604 = 1208.18\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 2, 0]}\n```",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 1081. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1081. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 921 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 5, 1, 6, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    60 x 0 + 91 x 5 + 36 x 1 + 54 x 6 + 66 x 4\n    which is 1079 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1081. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 2, 3, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 0, 3, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 0, 2, 1]\nRound 3: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 0, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

My goal is to get as much value as possible while ensuring Player 2 also gets enough value to accept the offer. A good starting point is to offer Player 2 slightly more than half of the total value, but also consider my outside offer value of 867.\n\nLet's start by calculating the total value of all items to me:\n(6 * 11) + (8 * 47) + (5 * 54) + (6 * 88) + (3 * 67) = 66 + 376 + 270 + 528 + 201 = 1441\n\nI need to offer player 2 an offer that is good enough for them to accept. Since I don't know their values, a reasonable strategy is to aim for roughly half of the total value. However, since I have a strong outside offer of 867, I should make an initial offer which ensures I get at least 867 if accepted. If player 2 accepts, my total value will be discounted by 0.98^(r-1).

                    "response": "To determine the optimal action, we will follow the step-by-step guidance outlined.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n- **Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer is valued at 1283.\n- **Values of the Items Involved**:\n  - Item 1: 22\n  - Item 2: 43\n  - Item 3: 65\n  - Item 4: 54\n  - Item 5: 93\n- **Total Pool of Items**: \n  - 6 units of item 1\n  - 8 units of item 2\n  - 5 units of item 3\n  - 6 units of item 4\n  - 3 units of item 5\n- **Discount Factor**: If the negotiation extends to further rounds, the value of any accepted offer will be multiplied by \\( \\gamma^{(r-1)} \\), where \\( \\gamma = 0.98 \\).\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n- **Value of the Current Offer**: [2, 3, 2, 2, 1] are the units offered to me.\n  - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 22 = 44\n  - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129\n  - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 65 = 130\n  - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 54 = 108\n  - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 93 = 93\n  - **Total Value** = 504\n\nThis value (504) is significantly lower than my outside offer of 1283. Thus, accepting the current offer is not a rational decision.\n\n- **Counteroffer Evaluation**: The goal is to propose a division that gives me a value higher than my outside offer of 1283.\n  - To secure a better outcome, let me calculate a counteroffer where I keep units in a way that maximizes my value:\n\nLet's consider keeping [6, 8, 5, 6, 3] (I take everything), calculate the value:\n  - 6 units of item 1 = 6 \u00d7 22 = 132\n  - 8 units of item 2 = 8 \u00d7 43 = 344\n  - 5 units of item 3 = 5 \u00d7 65 = 325\n  - 6 units of item 4 = 6 \u00d7 54 = 324\n  - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279\n  - **Total Value** = 1404\n\nThis total is higher than my outside offer, but keeping everything is likely unrealistic as a counteroffer.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\nGiven the constraints and the values, I need a counterproposal where the total value remains at least equal to or higher than my outside offer of 1283. Let me adjust slightly to offer more to Player 1 but still keep my value advantageous:\n\nProposing a counteroffer of [0, 0, 1, 3, 0] (I propose giving away these units):\n- I keep 6 units of item 1 = 6 \u00d7 22 = 132\n- I keep 8 units of item 2 = 8 \u00d7 43 = 344\n- I keep 4 units of item 3 = 4 \u00d7 65 = 260\n- I keep 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 54 = 162\n- I keep 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279\n- **Total Value** = 1177\n\nHowever, this is still not efficient as compared to my outside offer. Let me adjust further:\n\nProposing a counteroffer of [0, 1, 1, 3, 0]:\n- I keep 6 units of item 1 = 6 \u00d7 22 = 132\n- I keep 7 units of item 2 = 7 \u00d7 43 = 301\n- I keep 4 units of item 3 = 4 \u00d7 65 = 260\n- I keep 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 54 = 162\n- I keep 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279\n- **Total Value** = 1134\n\nThis still isn\u2019t satisfactory. Let me offer [1, 0, 0, 2, 0] as keeping the rest may suffice:\n- I keep 5 units of item 1 = 5 \u00d7 22 = 110\n- I keep 8 units of item 2 = 8 \u00d7 43 = 344\n- I keep 5 units of item 3 = 5 \u00d7 65 = 325\n- I keep 4 units of item 4 = 4 \u00d7 54 = 216\n- I keep 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279\n- **Total Value = 1274**, which is still less\n\nMaking an offer with these options becomes unbearable unless values come closer to a total of 0 items for Player 1.\n\nTo progress without degradation, failing to reach improved checking:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 3, 3, 7, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    40 x 1 + 8 x 3 + 23 x 3 + 69 x 7 + 40 x 0\n    which is 616 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 617. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 3, 2, 3, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 3, 2, 3, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 1, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    8 x 0 + 27 x 3 + 61 x 1 + 19 x 0 + 70 x 1\n    which is 212 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 213. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 1, 9, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 1, 9, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

My total value is 900.\n\nLet's try to aim for a split where Player 2 gets about half of my total value.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 135. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 603 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 3, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    37 x 0 + 89 x 0 + 29 x 3 + 9 x 1 + 37 x 1\n    which is 133 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 135. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 1, 2, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 1, 2, 3]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",

In round 1, the discount factor does not yet apply to the offer's value.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n#### Current Offer: [2, 1, 1, 2, 3] (the amount offered to me)\n- Value of items being offered to me:\n  - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 37 = 74\n  - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 89 = 89\n  - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 29 = 29\n  - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 9 = 18\n  - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111\n- **Total value if I accept the current offer:** 74 + 89 + 29 + 18 + 111 = 321\n\n#### Comparison with Outside Offer:\n- Value of current offer (321) is greater than the outside offer (135).\n\n### 3) Make a Decision Based on the Analysis:\n- **Accept the current offer?** Accepting gives me a value of 321, which is significantly higher than my outside offer of 135. Moreover, it does not incur mistakes 4 or 5, as the offer is better than the outside offer.\n- **Counteroffer or Walk?** Making a counteroffer requires it to be better than this current offer or strategically beneficial, but since this offer is favorable, there is no advantage to counteroffering or walking away.\n\nGiven this analysis, the current offer is substantially better than my outside offer, and accepting it ensures a significant gain.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    99 x 0 + 53 x 1 + 13 x 0 + 16 x 0 + 36 x 0\n    which is 53 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 54. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    99 x 0 + 53 x 1 + 13 x 0 + 16 x 0 + 36 x 0\n    which is 53 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 54. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 1, 2, 6, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 3, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 3, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "To evaluate the current situation, let's go through the analysis step by step.\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 54.\n   - My values for each unit of the items are:\n     - Item 1: 99\n     - Item 2: 53\n     - Item 3: 13\n     - Item 4: 16\n     - Item 5: 36\n   - The total pool of items is: \n     - Item 1: 3 units\n     - Item 2: 2 units\n     - Item 3: 3 units\n     - Item 4: 6 units\n     - Item 5: 2 units\n   - The discount factor, gamma = 0.98, reduces the value of future rounds. Given that it is round 2, if I decide to wait till round 3, the value will be further discounted by gamma^(2-1) = 0.98.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer to me: [1, 1, 1, 3, 0]\n     - Value = (1 * 99) + (1 * 53) + (1 * 13) + (3 * 16) + (0 * 36)\n     - Value = 99 + 53 + 13 + 48 + 0 = 213\n     - Since this value is greater than my outside offer of 54, accepting this offer would be beneficial compared to walking away.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - Evaluating the current offer of 213 against my outside offer of 54, the current offer is significantly better.\n   - Accepting this offer is better than walking away given that it provides a much higher value.\n   \nConsidering the analysis, the best action is to accept the current offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",
