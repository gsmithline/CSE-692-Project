In this game I have an outside option worth 718 (and no discount in round 1), so \u201cagreement\u201d must yield me more than 718 (after discounting) to be better than simply \u201cwalking away\u201d and cashing my offer. The current offer on the table would give me items that \u2013 by my own valuations \u2013 add up to only 450, which is significantly below my fallback value. Although I could try to \u201cengineer\u201d a division (by giving up some items, especially the ones I value very little\u2014such as item\u00a02 and item\u00a03\u2014so that Player\u00a01 gets enough \u201cincentive\u201d to agree), every counteroffer I can imagine that would give Player\u00a01 something near or above what they expect from their own outside offer forces me to \u201csacrifice\u201d a good chunk of my potential 1085 total. In the counteroffer I considered, even my best \u201caggressive\u201d proposal would leave me with only about 750 (or a smidgen more) in my present\u2010value terms\u2014only about 38 points above my fallback\u2014and it would have to give Player\u00a01 a bundle that (in expectation) is barely competitive with their own outside offer. In other words, by holding out I risk the possibility of discounting in later rounds (with gamma = 0.98) and a not\u2013so\u2013favorable (and uncertain) counteroffer from Player\u00a01 that might push my eventual share below 718.\n\nBecause I already have a strong outside offer (718) and the current proposal gives me far too little (450), I judge that the risks of making a counteroffer (and possibly getting into a prolonged negotiation that \u201cdiscounts away\u201d some of my value) are not worth the relatively small extra gain I might get even if a deal is reached. Therefore, my safest, most rational action is to WALK now and guarantee myself my outside offer of 718.\n\nThus, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

(Recall that although neither party knows the other\u2019s private values, we do know that for me items 2 and 5 are very good \u2013 76 and 88 per unit respectively \u2013 while for items 3 and 4 I\u2019m at a disadvantage relative to a typical opponent whose values are drawn uniformly in [1,101]. In fact, on average a random value is about 51. Thus my margin on item\u00a02 is roughly 76\u201351 = 25 and on item\u00a05 it is 37; whereas for item\u00a03 I lose about 26 per unit and for item\u00a04 about 11 per unit. For item\u00a01 my premium is only 7 per unit. \n\nPlayer\u00a01\u2019s current offer of [0, 4, 1, 1, 0] (which means that if I accepted, he would get the remainder, namely [2, 1, 4, 2, 2]) gives him roughly 2+1+4+2+2 = 11 total \u201cunits\u201d that\u2014if his true per\u2011unit values are near 51\u2014amount to approximately 561 in expected value. \n\nI\u2019d like to do better than 369 for myself \u2013 ideally above my outside offer of 448 \u2013 while roughly \u201cmatching\u201d the total pie that Player\u00a01 has already secured. In designing a counteroffer I can \u201ctrade\u201d items: I want to keep items 2 and 5 (which are very valuable for me) while conceding the ones in which I\u2019m relatively weak (items 3 and 4), and I can even afford a small \u201cadjustment\u201d on item\u00a01. \n\nOne proposal is as follows. I propose to offer Player\u00a01:\n\u2003\u2022 All of item 1 (i.e. 2 units),\n\u2003\u2022 1 unit of item 2 (leaving me 4 units),\n\u2003\u2022 All of item 3 (5 units),\n\u2003\u2022 All of item 4 (3 units),\n\u2003\u2022 0 units of item 5 (so I keep both units).\n\nThen, by definition of how counteroffers work, my allocation becomes the remaining quantities:\n\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 2 \u2013 2 = 0,\n\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 5 \u2013 1 = 4,\n\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 5 \u2013 5 = 0,\n\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 3 \u2013 3 = 0,\n\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 2 \u2013 0 = 2.\n\nMy total value then is:\n\u2003\u20030\u00d758 + 4\u00d776 + 0\u00d725 + 0\u00d740 + 2\u00d788 = 304 + 176 = 480.\nThis 480 is better than 448 (my outside option) and much improved over 369.\n\nPlayer\u00a01\u2019s allocation in my proposal would be:\n\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 2, \n\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 1,\n\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 5,\n\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 3,\n\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 0.\nComparing with his original \u201cwinning\u201d bundle (which would have been [2, 1, 4, 2, 2] if I accepted his offer), he gets 1 extra unit of item 3 and 1 extra unit of item 4 but no item 5. In expectation (using an average value near 51), that extra +51 +51 is offset by losing 2\u00d751 = 102 from item 5. In other words, his overall expected value remains roughly the same. (Of course, if his private value for item 5 is much higher than expected, he might object, but with uniformly random values he is as likely to be average as not.)\n\nGiven that this proposal improves my outcome (480 > 448) while leaving Player\u00a01 roughly where his current proposal would have been (roughly 561 expected in both cases), it is a reasonable counteroffer in round\u00a01.\n\nSo my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 5, 3, 0]}",

My disagreement (outside) value is 162. Thus, accepting now yields much more (317) than my fallback.\n3. While I do value items 4 and 5 highly (58 and 75, respectively), Player 1\u2019s current offer does not provide any of these. I could try to counteroffer to claim them, but because additional negotiation rounds incur discounting (with factor \u03b3 = 0.98 per round beyond the first) and given the uncertainty about Player 1\u2019s private values, risking delay might reduce my overall payoff.\n4. Since the current offer already secures me a solid payoff (317 vs. 162) without discounting or further risk, it is safer to accept rather than aggressively countering for more of the high\u2010value items.\n\nBased on these considerations, I choose to ACCEPT the current offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

                    "response": "I will not ACCEPT the current offer because its value to me is far below my outside option. (Right now the current offer would give me a bundle [0, 1, 0, 1, 1] whose value to me is 0\u00b76 + 1\u00b712 + 0\u00b715 + 1\u00b797 + 1\u00b766 = 175, which is much lower than my outside option of 396.) \n\nBecause my own total value for all items is 443, in order for any deal to be worthwhile I must guarantee myself at least 396. In other words, if I denote by \u201cmy concession\u201d the value (using my own per\u2010unit values) of the items I give Player\u00a01, then I must keep at least 443 \u2013 396 = 47 in \u201cvalue terms.\u201d Thus I may \u201cconcede\u201d at most 47 points worth of items according to my values. \n\nSince I very highly value item\u00a04 (97 per unit) and item\u00a05 (66 per unit), I want to keep all of those. I am then left to \u201cconcede\u201d only items 1, 2, and 3. My per\u2010unit values for these are 6, 12, and 15 respectively. (Notice that if I were to give away any unit of items 4 or 5, it would cost me too dearly.) \n\nA natural tactic is to \u201cbuy\u201d Player\u00a01\u2019s acceptance by offering him as much as possible (in terms of quantity) from the low\u2010cost items while still keeping my own value above 396. For example, if I give him all of item\u00a01 (1 unit worth 6 points) and all of item\u00a02 (3 units worth 36 points) the total \u201closs\u201d on my side is 6 + 36 = 42. Then I keep the remainder:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a01: I get 0 (since there is 1 unit total)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a02: I get 0 (since there are 3 units total)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a03: I get all 5 units (worth 5\u00b715 = 75)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a04: I get both units (2\u00b797 = 194)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a05: I get both units (2\u00b766 = 132)\nSo my overall value becomes 75 + 194 + 132 = 401, which exceeds my reservation of 396. \n\n(One may consider alternative splits within items 1\u20133. For instance, giving [1, 2, 1, 0, 0] would \u201ccost\u201d me 6 + 24 + 15 = 45, leaving me with a bundle valued at 443 \u2013 45 = 398. In expectation the \u201coffer to Player\u00a01\u201d will depend on his own secret preferences. As I have no information about his specific valuations, a natural choice is to offer him everything in the items that I consider \u201ccheap\u201d: namely, all of item\u00a01 and all of item\u00a02. This gives him a total bundle of 1 + 3 = 4 items from items I study as being relatively low\u2010cost for me\u2014even though for him they might be valued fairly highly.)\n\nThus, my counteroffer is to give Player\u00a01 the entire stock of item\u00a01 and item\u00a02, and to keep the rest. In offer\u2010notation (where the offer we submit is what we \u201cgive\u201d to Player\u00a01), that is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 3, 0, 0, 0]}",

Thus if we got all items our total \u201cpre\u2010discount\u201d value would be 6+36+75+194+132 = 443.\n\u2219 Our outside (disagreement) payoff is 396 (and that is received with no discount). In any negotiated deal the value we \u201cfeel\u201d is our allocation\u2019s total (according to our own values) multiplied by \u03b3^(r\u20131). In round\u202f2 that factor is 0.98, but if we counteroffer now, assuming acceptance doesn\u2019t occur until round\u202f3 the product will be multiplied by 0.98\u00b2 \u2248 0.9604.\n  \nLooking at the current offer on the table, Player 1 is giving us [0, 2, 2, 1, 1]. That would mean we get (using our values) 0\u00b76 + 2\u00b712 + 2\u00b715 + 1\u00b797 + 1\u00b766 = 0 + 24 + 30 + 97 + 66 = 217. Even if we accepted immediately (discount factor 0.98), that would yield roughly 217\u00d70.98 \u2248 212.7 \u2013 far below our fallback of 396.\n\nThus we need to \u201ctake the negotiation to round 3\u201d with a counteroffer that, if accepted, gives us a pre\u2010discount total high enough that after discounting we do at least as well as our fallback.\n\nRecall that if a deal is reached in round\u202f3 the discount is \u03b3^(3\u20131) = 0.98\u00b2 \u2248 0.9604. Therefore, to do at least as well as 396 we need a pre\u2010discount total of at least 396/0.9604 \u2248 412.5. Since our outcome values come in integer multiples we\u2019d want at least 413 \u201craw\u201d points by our measures.\n\nWe like items 4 and 5 (worth 97 and 66 each) very much and want to keep both units of each. That\u2019s 2\u00d797 + 2\u00d766 = 194 + 132 = 326. Then we\u2019d need at least an extra 413\u2013326 = 87 points from the \u201ccheaper\u201d items 1, 2, and 3. One promising allocation is to also get all 5 of item\u202f3 (5\u00d715 = 75) and 1 unit of item\u202f2 (1\u00d712 = 12). This gives a total of 75 + 12 = 87; adding that to 326 gives exactly 413. In other words, we secure for ourselves the allocation \n\u2003\u2003[0, 1, 5, 2, 2]\u2003\u2003\nwhich has a raw value of 0 + 12 + 75 + 194 + 132 = 413. If accepted in round 3 the discount brings our payoff to about 413\u00d70.9604 \u2248 396 \u2013 roughly matching our fallback (and hopefully, we might get slightly more if Player 1 prefers to avoid delay).\n\nSince any negotiated division is determined by how many units we offer to Player\u202f1 (with our share being the residue from the totals), note that with our desired allocation for ourselves [0,1,5,2,2] Player\u202f1 gets the remainder:\n\u2003Total \u2013 Our share = [1\u20130, 3\u20131, 5\u20135, 2\u20132, 2\u20132] = [1,2,0,0,0].\n\nThus our counteroffer (what we \u201cgive\u201d to Player\u202f1) is [1, 2, 0, 0, 0].\n\nBased on this reasoning, our action is as follows:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1,2,0,0,0]}",

At the same time the counteroffer must be \u201creasonable\u201d to Player\u202f1 so that they prefer the deal over waiting or walking away. \n\nMy valuation is very \u201cskewed\u201d: I get high value from item\u202f1 (61), item\u202f3 (53), and item\u202f5 (61) while item\u202f2 (2) and item\u202f4 (40) are relatively poor for me. In other words, I\u2019d like to keep most or all of the high\u2010value items for myself while conceding \u201ccheaper\u201d items to Player\u202f1. (Note that the totals for the items are: item\u202f1:1, item\u202f2:1, item\u202f3:4, item\u202f4:2, and item\u202f5:4.) \n\nPlayer\u202f1\u2019s offer, by giving me [0, 1, 3, 0, 1], would leave them with the complement [1, 0, 1, 2, 3]. (We don\u2019t know their private values, but since both players\u2019 values are drawn from similar distributions, we expect that on average they would care about \u201cfair\u2010splits\u201d at roughly the same overall numbers.) In our counteroffer we want to \u201cimprove\u201d our outcome significantly (i.e. ensure we get value above 345) while not \u201coutright\u201d robbing Player\u202f1 of a bundle that, by comparison with what they originally offered themselves, would seem very unattractive. \n\nAfter considering different options I decided on one that gives me an allocation of \n\u2003\u2003[ Total \u2013 Offer ] = [1, 0, 2, 0, 3],\nwhich yields a value for me of \n\u2003\u20031\u00d761 + 0\u00d72 + 2\u00d753 + 0\u00d740 + 3\u00d761 = 61 + 0 + 106 + 0 + 183 = 350.\nThis is safely above 345. \nAt the same time the offer I present (i.e. the bundle awarded to Player\u202f1) is \n\u2003\u2003[0, 1, 2, 2, 1].\nLet\u2019s check that it is \u201cfeasible\u201d (each number does not exceed the available items) and note that in the original proposal Player\u202f1 would have ended up with [1, 0, 1, 2, 3]. Here they would have a slightly different mix (getting the entire item\u202f2 and extra one unit of item\u202f3) but giving up a unit of item\u202f1 and two units of item\u202f5. (Since I know my own preferences very well but not theirs, this \u201ccompromise\u201d is intended to keep the deal on the table by ensuring that\u2014even if Player\u202f1\u2019s private values are roughly average\u2014the bundle they\u2019d get is in the same ball\u2010park as what they earlier implied for themselves.) \n\nThus, my counteroffer is to offer Player\u202f1 the bundle [0, 1, 2, 2, 1] (which means I would keep [1, 0, 2, 0, 3] for myself, with a present value of 350) and so this counteroffer beats my outside option while giving Player\u202f1 at least a comparable share to what they might hold out for.\n\nTherefore, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 2, 2, 1]}",

If your counteroffer is rejected then you risk ending with an outcome no better than your outside offer \u2013 and potentially at even higher discounting in later rounds.\n5. Given that the current offer values you at only \u2248257 versus your guaranteed outside value of 345, the rational action is to WALK away.\n\nThus, my answer is:\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

In addition, to induce Player\u202f1 to accept, I would have to give him a share that is competitive with what he would get from his own proposal\u2014which (given his initial offer) is quite generous. In his offer he is effectively keeping the remainder\u2014which is, for example, [5, 1, 1, 3, 2] (since totals are [9, 1, 2, 3, 2])\u2014a bundle that\u2014if he were to evaluate it roughly with average values\u2014is very attractive compared to what I would be proposing if I tried to capture even more of my high\u2010value items.\n\nGiven that I already get a value of 151 (without any discount) and my outside option is extremely low (4), I have little reason to risk a counteroffer that might lower the present value of my deal or lead to a delay.

You can secure at most 775 points (if you got all items) but you need to do better than your outside offer (632) now. In order for your deal to beat your outside offer, you must secure at least 632 points from your share. That means you can only concede at most 775 \u2013 632 = 143 points (in your own valuation).\n\nStep 3: Choose items to concede. In your own valuation, you want to give a \u201csweetener\u201d to Player 1 that is inexpensive for you but potentially valuable for them. Item 4 (worth 13 for you) and item 5 (worth 6 for you) are low in your value. In fact, if you give all 7 units of item4 and the single unit of item5 away, you concede 7\u00d713 + 1\u00d76 = 91 + 6 = 97 points\u2014well below your 143\u2010point threshold.\n\nStep 4: Formulate the counteroffer. In a counteroffer you specify what you are \u201cgiving\u201d to Player 1. The remaining items (totals minus the counteroffer amounts) go to you. One promising candidate is to give Player 1:\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 0 units (so you keep all 4 units)\n\u2003\u2003Item 2: 0 units (you keep all 4)\n\u2003\u2003Item 3: 0 units (you keep both)\n\u2003\u2003Item 4: 7 units (all of it)\n\u2003\u2003Item 5: 1 unit (all of it)\nThen your bundle becomes:\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 4 units, item 2: 4, item 3: 2, item 4: 7\u20137 = 0, item 5: 1\u20131 = 0.\nYour value is: 4\u00d739 + 4\u00d781 + 2\u00d799 = 156 + 324 + 198 = 678, which is above your outside option of 632.\nPlayer 1, while we do not know their private values, gets the entire stock of item4 and item5 (which you value low but they might value higher) and avoids having to risk waiting. This seems a reasonable concession.\n\nStep 5: Decide on the action.

In the current offer Player\u202f1 is proposing to give me [1,1,1,3,1] which\u2014using my private per\u2010unit values (39, 81, 99, 13, and 6 for items 1\u20135 respectively)\u2014yields an undiscounted value to me of \n\n\u2003\u20031\u00d739 + 1\u00d781 + 1\u00d799 + 3\u00d713 + 1\u00d76 = 39 + 81 + 99 + 39 + 6 = 264.\n\nBecause we\u2019re in round 2 the deal is multiplied by the discount factor 0.98 so my \u201cpresent\u2010value\u201d would be about 264\u00d70.98 \u2248 258.7. By comparison, my outside offer is 632 (which is not discounted and is available if negotiations end). \n\nI considered whether I could \u201ccounteroffer\u201d a division that would let me keep high\u2010value items (items 1\u20133) while \u201csacrificing\u201d lower\u2013value items (items 4 and 5) so that I\u2019d secure an allocation that\u2014after discounting\u2014gives me a value higher than 632. For instance, if I kept all of items 1,2 and 3 I\u2019d get \n\u2003\u20034\u00d739 + 4\u00d781 + 2\u00d799 = 156 + 324 + 198 = 678,\nand if I granted Player\u202f1 all of items 4 and 5 (which are, for me, only 7\u00d713 + 1\u00d76 = 91+6 = 97 in value) then my \u201closs\u201d would be 97 in my own value. In that case my deal would be worth 678 (undiscounted) or about 678\u00d70.98 \u2248 664.4 when discounted. While that is above 632, it would mean giving Player\u202f1 a bundle (all of item 4 and 5) that, by simple tally of numbers, is less than what they get in the offer they made ([3,3,1,4,0] gives them a total of 11 units compared with 8 units here) and (assuming they value items roughly similarly on average) might make them prefer waiting.\n\nI explored possible tweaks (sacrificing a bit more from my highly\u2013valued items) to \u201csweeten\u201d the deal for Player\u202f1, yet any shift that would increase their payoff enough would require me to give up too much of my high\u2013value items, dropping my own value below the threshold needed to beat my outside option. Since I can guarantee 632 by simply quitting negotiations (and 632 is far above the discounted ~259 I\u2019d get if I accepted the current offer), the risk of pushing for a counteroffer that might be rejected (to then fall back on my outside option) is not worth it.\n\nGiven that the safe outside guarantee of 632 is so much higher than what any counteroffer on the table now would yield me (once discounting and risk are considered), my best action is to WALK away.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Accepting won\u2019t meet our reservation.\n\nStep 2: When making a counteroffer, we propose a division of the items. The full set of items is:  \nItem 1: 4, Item 2: 3, Item 3: 3, Item 4: 5, Item 5: 4  \nIf we offer Player 1 a bundle x = [x1, x2, x3, x4, x5], then we get the remainder ([4 \u2013 x1, 3 \u2013 x2, 3 \u2013 x3, 5 \u2013 x4, 4 \u2013 x5]).

Our private values per item are:\n\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 88\u2003\u2003\u2003Item 2: 57\u2003\u2003\u2003Item 3: 25\u2003\u2003\u2003Item 4: 66\u2003\u2003\u2003Item 5: 46.\n3. Therefore, the value for each item in the offer is:\n\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 2 \u00d7 88 = 176\n\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 0 \u00d7 57 = 0\n\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 1 \u00d7 25 = 25\n\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 2 \u00d7 66 = 132\n\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 2 \u00d7 46 = 92\n\u2003Total value = 176 + 0 + 25 + 132 + 92 = 425.\n4. With a discount factor of gamma = 0.98 and being in round 1, the discount applied is gamma^(1-1)=1 so we receive the full 425.\n5. Our private outside offer is 262, significantly lower than the 425 offered.\n6. Counteroffering introduces delay and risk (including potential for a worse subsequent discount or breakdown of negotiation) and is unlikely to yield a better outcome for us, as we already have a very favorable offer.\n7.
