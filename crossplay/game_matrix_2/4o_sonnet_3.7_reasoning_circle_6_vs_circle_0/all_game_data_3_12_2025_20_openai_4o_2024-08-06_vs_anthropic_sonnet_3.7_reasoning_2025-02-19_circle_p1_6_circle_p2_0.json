                    "prompt": "\n    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\n    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\n    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\n    There are 6 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\n    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\n    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 101.\n    Your private values are 76 for item 1, 5 for item 2, 18 for item 3, 95 for item 4, 98 for item 5.\n    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to your total value of all items, which is 1327. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 1143. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1143. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 876 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 0, 4, 6, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    76 x 4 + 5 x 0 + 18 x 4 + 95 x 6 + 98 x 2\n    which is 1142 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1143. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To determine an optimal strategy, let's go through the steps as described:\n\n### 1) Analyze the Current Situation:\n- **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 1143.\n- **Values of the Items:**\n  - Item 1: 76 per unit\n  - Item 2: 5 per unit\n  - Item 3: 18 per unit\n  - Item 4: 95 per unit\n  - Item 5: 98 per unit\n- **Total Pool of Items:** There are 6 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5 available.\n- **Discount Factor Influence:** As the discount factor is 0.98, the longer the negotiation takes, the less valuable the outcome becomes. Therefore, a valuable offer sooner is preferable.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\nSince there is currently no offer on the table, we proceed to consider potential initial offers. First, let's calculate the value of keeping certain items and offering the rest:\n\n- **Counteroffer Consideration:**\n  Let's consider a scenario where I keep a significant portion of high-value items for me:\n  - Keeping: \n    - 3 units of item 1\n    - 1 unit of item 2\n    - 3 units of item 3\n    - 4 units of item 4\n    - 1 unit of item 5\n    \n  **Calculate Total Value:**\n  - Value from item 1: \\(3 \\times 76 = 228\\)\n  - Value from item 2: \\(1 \\times 5 = 5\\)\n  - Value from item 3: \\(3 \\times 18 = 54\\)\n  - Value from item 4: \\(4 \\times 95 = 380\\)\n  - Value from item 5: \\(1 \\times 98 = 98\\)\n  \n  **Total Value:** 228 + 5 + 54 + 380 + 98 = 765\n\nSince 765 is less than my outside offer of 1143, this is not a good offer for me. I must adjust to get a value greater than 1143.\n\nLet's calculate a configuration that moves closer to the outside offer value:\n\n- **Revised Offer:**\n  Keeping:\n  - 6 units of item 1\n  - 0 units of item 2\n  - 5 units of item 3\n  - 6 units of item 4\n  - 2 units of item 5\n\n**Calculate Total Value:**\n- Value from item 1: \\(6 \\times 76 = 456\\)\n- Value from item 2: \\(0 \\times 5 = 0\\)\n- Value from item 3: \\(5 \\times 18 = 90\\)\n- Value from item 4: \\(6 \\times 95 = 570\\)\n- Value from item 5: \\(2 \\times 98 = 196\\)\n\n**Total Value:** 456 + 0 + 90 + 570 + 196 = 1312\n\nThis value is higher than my outside offer, which indicates I am better off negotiating this division.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision:\nBased on the above calculations, I should propose a counteroffer that gives me a better value than my outside offer. I will offer Player 2 the least valuable allocation based on my calculations:\n\nOffer:\n- 0 units of item 1\n- 3 units of item 2\n- 0 units of item 3\n- 0 units of item 4\n- 0 units of item 5\n\nThis offer allows me to maximize the retained value with my items, while offering items that have less value to me.\n\n**My Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

If we wait for another round, the present value is multiplied by 0.98 again, making future offers slightly less valuable.\n\n### 2) Assess the value of offers:\n\n- **For the current offer [5, 0, 0, 5, 2]:**\n  - Value = \\(5 \\times 76 + 0 \\times 5 + 0 \\times 18 + 5 \\times 95 + 2 \\times 98\\)\n  - = 380 + 0 + 0 + 475 + 196\n  - = 1051\n  - Adjusted for the discount factor (0.98): \\(1051 \\times 0.98 = 1030\\)\n\n- **Compare the current offer to my outside offer:**\n  - The current offer value to me is 1030, which is less than my outside offer of 1143.\n\n- **Evaluate potential counteroffers:** \n  - In the previous round, I offered [0, 3, 0, 0, 0]. Let's consider keeping more high-value items.\n  - My optimal offer would keep the highest value for myself while ensuring it exceeds 1143.\n\n### 3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n\nConsidering my need to exceed my outside offer value of 1143 and maximize my value, let's create a competitive counteroffer.\n\n- **Proposed Counteroffer: [4, 3, 4, 0, 0]**\n  - My retained items: [2, 0, 1, 6, 2]\n  - Total value to me:\n    - \\(76 \\times 2 + 5 \\times 0 + 18 \\times 1 + 95 \\times 6 + 98 \\times 2\\)\n    - = 152 + 0 + 18 + 570 + 196\n    - = 936 + 196\n    - = 1132\n\nHowever, 1132 is just shy of my outside offer. Let's angle for a small adjustment:\n\nAdjusting again: **Propose Counteroffer: [5, 0, 3, 1, 0]**\n\n- My retained items: [1, 3, 2, 5, 2]\n- Total value to me:\n  - \\(76 \\times 1 + 5 \\times 3 + 18 \\times 2 + 95 \\times 5 + 98 \\times 2\\)\n  - = 76 + 15 + 36 + 475 + 196\n  - = 798\n  - - Calculate: \\( 798 \\times 0.98 \\approx 782 \\)\n\nThis is not in favor, thus after evaluating correct errors:\n\n**Counteroffer strategy** keeping a pivotal value:\n\n- Offer high reasoning and [6, 3, 0, 0, 0] a new counter with rationality applied:\n    - Units & value I retain: [0, 0, 5, 6, 2]\n    - Final value: \\(0 + 0 + 90 + 570 + 196\\)\n    - = 856; Value: \\(856 \\times 0.98 = 839 \\)\n\nCorrect counter below the needed outcome -\n\nWith negotiation for calculative results - Let's effectively readjust strategically in our next round optimization. A proposal solidifying:\n\n**Optimal for evaluated offer:**\n- A counter aligned: [0, 0, 5, 6, 2]\t\n\nTo rectify intent on influencing decision thus far does - aiming our gain preferable value.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [6, 3, 5, 6, 2]}}\n\\]",

                    "prompt": "\n    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\n    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\n    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\n    There are 1 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\n    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\n    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 101.\n    Your private values are 21 for item 1, 81 for item 2, 86 for item 3, 42 for item 4, 24 for item 5.\n    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to your total value of all items, which is 809. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 226. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 226. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 762 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 0, 0, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    21 x 1 + 81 x 1 + 86 x 0 + 42 x 0 + 24 x 5\n    which is 222 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 226. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Let's break this down step by step according to the questions provided:\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 226.\n   - My values for the items are: \n     - Item 1: 21\n     - Item 2: 81\n     - Item 3: 86\n     - Item 4: 42\n     - Item 5: 24\n   - Total pool of items is:\n     - Item 1: 1\n     - Item 2: 4\n     - Item 3: 4\n     - Item 4: 0\n     - Item 5: 5\n   - The discount factor (gamma = 0.98) reduces the value of future offers by a small percentage each round. This means if I delay the conclusion by one round, the value of the outcome for me will be multiplied by 0.98. \n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - There is currently no offer on the table.\n   - I need to consider potential counteroffers where the value I keep is greater than or equal to my outside offer of 226.\n\n3) Decision Making:\n   - Since there is no current offer, I'll make an initial offer that ensures my retained value is better than or equal to 226.\n   - Let's calculate a possible division of items that might give me the highest value:\n\nI start by maximizing my value by keeping items that carry the highest weight for me:\n\n1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 21 = 21\n2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 81 = 162 (half of item 2 pool)\n2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 86 = 172 (half of item 3 pool)\n5 units of item 5 = 5 \u00d7 24 = 120  (all units of item 5)\n\nTotal value I keep = 21 + 162 + 172 + 120 = 475\n\nBy calculating this division, we see that it gives me a total value of 475, which is significantly above my outside offer of 226.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 0, 0, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    21 x 1 + 81 x 1 + 86 x 0 + 42 x 0 + 24 x 5\n    which is 222 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 226. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 2, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 2, 0, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 2, 0, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 4, 0, 2, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    62 x 0 + 53 x 4 + 60 x 0 + 97 x 2 + 97 x 6\n    which is 988 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 990. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 2, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 2, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 2, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To decide on the appropriate action, let's go through the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value: 990\n   - Values of the items involved:\n     - Item 1: 62\n     - Item 2: 53\n     - Item 3: 60\n     - Item 4: 97\n     - Item 5: 97\n   - Total pool of items: 1 unit of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5\n   - The discount factor is 0.98, and we are in round 2, so the discount will apply at (r-1). Since it is still the second round, the impact is minimal in this round. It becomes more significant in further rounds.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer (given to me): [1, 1, 2, 2, 0]\n     - My total value if I accept:\n       - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 62 = 62\n       - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 53 = 53\n       - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 60 = 120\n       - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 97 = 194\n       - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 97 = 0\n     - Total value = 62 + 53 + 120 + 194 + 0 = 429\n   - After applying the discount factor for round 2 (0.98), the value is 429 \u00d7 0.98 = 420.42\n   - Compare 420.42 to my outside offer value of 990. Clearly, the current offer is much less valuable than walking away.\n\n3) Make a decision based on analysis:\n   - I should not accept the current offer because 420.42 is significantly less than my outside offer value of 990.\n   - Walking away would guarantee me a value of 990.\n   - I should propose a counteroffer with a value greater than or equal to my outside offer.\n\nLet's calculate a possible counteroffer:\n   - Suppose I keep: [1, 3, 0, 3, 6]\n   - Total value:\n     - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 62 = 62\n     - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159\n     - 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 60 = 0\n     - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291\n     - 6 units of item 5 = 6 \u00d7 97 = 582\n   - Total value = 62 + 159 + 0 + 291 + 582 = 1094\n   - 1094 > 990, so it's better than my outside offer.\n\nGiven this analysis, the counteroffer of [0, 1, 2, 0, 0] in the first round was quite low compared to my outside offer, but the new counteroffer should provide an outcome favorable to me.\n\nMy action is:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 2, 0, 0]}\n```",

Your value would be:\n    62 x 0 + 53 x 4 + 60 x 0 + 97 x 2 + 97 x 6\n    which is 988 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 990. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 2, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 2, 2, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 2, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 2, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 2, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 423. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 663 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

Start with a plan where I keep a significant portion of high-value items:\n\n- Keep 0 units of item 1 (value 0 to me, giving full advantage to Player 2 in this regard)\n- Keep 2 units of item 2 (2 x 19 = 38)\n- Keep 3 units of item 3 (3 x 83 = 249)\n- Keep 5 units of item 4 (5 x 80 = 400)\n- Keep 2 units of item 5 (2 x 31 = 62)\n\nCalculating my total value:\n\n\\[ \n\\text{Total Value} = 0 + 38 + 249 + 400 + 62 = 749 \n\\]\n\nThis value is above my outside offer of 423, which means it is a favorable offer for me.\n\nHence, the initial offer to Player 2 is the remaining items:\n\n- Offer 5 units of item 1 (all units of item 1)\n- Offer 6 units of item 2 (8 - 2 = 6)\n- Offer 1 unit of item 3 (4 - 3 = 1)\n- Offer 2 units of item 4 (7 - 5 = 2)\n- Offer 1 unit of item 5 (3 - 2 = 1)\n\nLet's propose this counteroffer and ensure it meets our objective:\n\n\\[\n\\text{{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [5, 6, 1, 2, 1]}}\n\\]",

                    "response": "To make a decision, let's go through the steps and analyze the situation.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n- **Outside offer value**: 871\n- **Values of the items to me**:\n  - Item 1: 96 per unit\n  - Item 2: 41 per unit\n  - Item 3: 14 per unit\n  - Item 4: 41 per unit\n  - Item 5: 42 per unit\n- **Total pool of items**: 4 of Item 1, 6 of Item 2, 4 of Item 3, 4 of Item 4, 3 of Item 5\n- **Discount factor influence**: The discount factor is 0.98; however, since this is the first round, we won't need to apply it immediately, but it's crucial to note that values will decrease slightly if the negotiation goes into a second round and further into the third round.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n- **Current offer on the table**: None, as this is the initial stage.\n- **Potential counteroffers**: I must propose a valid initial offer where the value to me is greater than 871 (my outside offer). \n\nLet's consider a distribution where I try to maximize my value:\n1. Keep all units of the highest value (Item 1), because even one unit is significant (96).\n2. Make a balanced split for the remaining items, but prioritize items in terms of value.\n\n#### Proposal:\n- **Items kept by me**: \n  - Item 1: 4 units (4 x 96 = 384)\n  - Item 2: 5 units (5 x 41 = 205)\n  - Item 3: 2 units (2 x 14 = 28)\n  - Item 4: 2 units (2 x 41 = 82)\n  - Item 5: 2 units (2 x 42 = 84)\n- **Items offered to Player 2**:\n  - Item 1: 0\n  - Item 2: 1\n  - Item 3: 2\n  - Item 4: 2\n  - Item 5: 1\n\n**Total value to me**: 384 (Item 1) + 205 (Item 2) + 28 (Item 3) + 82 (Item 4) + 84 (Item 5) = 783\n\nThis doesn't exceed the outside offer of 871, so we need to adjust further:\n\n#### Revised Proposal:\n- **Items kept by me**: \n  - Item 1: 4 units (4 x 96 = 384)\n  - Item 2: 4 units (4 x 41 = 164)\n  - Item 3: 3 units (3 x 14 = 42)\n  - Item 4: 3 units (3 x 41 = 123)\n  - Item 5: 1 unit (1 x 42 = 42)\n- **Items offered to Player 2**:\n  - Item 1: 0\n  - Item 2: 2\n  - Item 3: 1\n  - Item 4: 1\n  - Item 5: 2\n\n**Total value to me**: 384 + 164 + 42 + 123 + 42 = 755\n\nI need to keep changing allocations until my value is greater than 871 or respond with WALK if not possible, but it seems achievable based on the strategic allocation. Let's further adjust by reducing my share of the least valuables.\n\n### Final Proposal:\n- **Items kept by me**: \n  - Item 1: 4 units (4 x 96 = 384)\n  - Item 2: 4 units (4 x 41 = 164)\n  - Item 3: 2 units (2 x 14 = 28)\n  - Item 4: 3 units (3 x 41 = 123)\n  - Item 5: 2 units (2 x 42 = 84)\n- **Items offered to Player 2**:\n  - Item 1: 0\n  - Item 2: 2\n  - Item 3: 2\n  - Item 4: 1\n  - Item 5: 1\n\n**Total value to me**: 384 + 164 + 28 + 123 + 84 = 783\n\nGiven the challenge in reaching >871 strategically by round 2's constraints, my possible moves will be affected but ideally, an adjusted, astute offer should hit optimal thresholds by ensuing rounds with iterative shifting based on opposing party reactions.\n\n### Step 3: Decision\nThe final value calculated remains lower than 871; hence a WALK away approach seems viable given projected strategic shifts set in place subsequently beneficial for player cutbacks leveraging lower ranking item redistribution after initial cuts given inherent cost-basic offers.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 235. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 235. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 750 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    52 x 0 + 30 x 0 + 51 x 0 + 34 x 2 + 83 x 2\n    which is 234 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 235. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This means that if I accept the current offer in round 2, the value I get from it will be multiplied by gamma to the power of (2-1), which is 0.98.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n   - **Current Offer:** [5, 1, 1, 0, 1]\n     - Calculate the total value to me:\n       - Item 1: 5 \u00d7 52 = 260\n       - Item 2: 1 \u00d7 30 = 30\n       - Item 3: 1 \u00d7 51 = 51\n       - Item 4: 0 \u00d7 34 = 0\n       - Item 5: 1 \u00d7 83 = 83\n     - Total value = 260 + 30 + 51 + 0 + 83 = 424\n     - Discounted value in round 2 = 424 \u00d7 0.98 = 415.52\n   - Compare this to my outside offer of 235. The current offer is significantly better than my outside offer.\n   - Previous offer I made in round 1 to Player 2 was [2, 1, 3, 0, 1], which had a total value of:\n     - Item 1: 3 \u00d7 52 = 156\n     - Item 2: 0 \u00d7 30 = 0\n     - Item 3: 0 \u00d7 51 = 0\n     - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 34 = 68\n     - Item 5: 1 \u00d7 83 = 83\n     - Total value = 156 + 0 + 0 + 68 + 83 = 307\n     - Discounted value in round 2 = 307 \u00d7 0.98 = 300.86\n\n3) **Decision Making:**\n   - Accepting the current offer results in a value of 415.52, which is much greater than my outside offer of 235 and also greater than my offer from round 1. \n   - Therefore, the best course of action is to accept the current offer.\n\nBased on the analysis, it is optimal to accept the current offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 789. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 789. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 774 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 6, 2, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    14 x 2 + 98 x 6 + 24 x 2 + 43 x 1 + 79 x 1\n    which is 786 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 789. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To approach this negotiation, I'll start by analyzing the current situation based on the questions provided.\n\n1) Current Situation Analysis:\n   - **My outside offer value:** 789\n   - **Values of the items:**\n     - Item 1: 14\n     - Item 2: 98\n     - Item 3: 24\n     - Item 4: 43\n     - Item 5: 79\n   - **Total pool of items:** \n     - Item 1: 2 units\n     - Item 2: 7 units\n     - Item 3: 2 units\n     - Item 4: 1 unit\n     - Item 5: 3 units\n   - **Discount factor:** If the negotiation concludes in a later round, the value of the accepted offer will be multiplied by a discount factor depending on the number of rounds. Therefore, finalizing a beneficial offer in earlier rounds is advantageous.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Currently, there is no offer on the table that I can assess for acceptance.\n   - I need to make my initial offer, ensuring that the value I retain is greater than my outside offer of 789.\n\n3) Decision Making:\n\nGiven the information, I want to make an initial offer where my retained value is favorable compared to my outside offer. Let's calculate a potential offer for Player 2:\n\nLet's try offering Player 2 the following:\n- 0 units of Item 1\n- 3 units of Item 2\n- 0 units of Item 3\n- 0 units of Item 4\n- 1 unit of Item 5\n\nThis means I would keep:\n- 2 units of Item 1: Remaining value = 2 * 14 = 28\n- 4 units of Item 2: Remaining value = 4 * 98 = 392\n- 2 units of Item 3: Remaining value = 2 * 24 = 48\n- 1 unit of Item 4: Remaining value = 1 * 43 = 43\n- 2 units of Item 5: Remaining value = 2 * 79 = 158\n\nThe total value I retain = 28 + 392 + 48 + 43 + 158 = 669\n\nThis retained value of 669 is currently lower than my outside offer, so I need to retain more value.\n\nAdjusting the offer:\nLet's try keeping:\n- 2 units of Item 1\n- 5 units of Item 2\n- 2 units of Item 3\n- 1 unit of Item 4\n- 2 units of Item 5\n\nThis means offering Player 2:\n- 0 units of Item 1\n- 2 units of Item 2\n- 0 units of Item 3\n- 0 units of Item 4\n- 1 unit of Item 5\n\nThe value I would retain with this offer is:\n- 2 units of Item 1: Remaining value = 2 * 14 = 28\n- 5 units of Item 2: Remaining value = 5 * 98 = 490\n- 2 units of Item 3: Remaining value = 2 * 24 = 48\n- 1 unit of Item 4: Remaining value = 1 * 43 = 43\n- 2 units of Item 5: Remaining value = 2 * 79 = 158\n\nThe total value I retain = 28 + 490 + 48 + 43 + 158 = 767\n\nThe value 767 is still less than my outside offer value of 789. After adjusting, now let's make an optimal offer:\n\n- Keep all 7 units of Item 2:\n  - 7 * 98 = 686\n- Offer everything else (because Item 2 has the highest value to me), but still keep the minimum units possible from the others to maintain a high value offer.\n\nI will offer Player 2:\n- 0 Item 1\n- 0 Item 2\n- 0 Item 3\n- 0 Item 4\n- 2 Item 5\n  \nThe value I will retain:\n- 2 units of Item 1: 2 \u00d7 14 = 28\n- 7 units of Item 2: 7 \u00d7 98 = 686\n- 2 units of Item 3: 2 \u00d7 24 = 48\n- 1 unit of Item 4: 1 \u00d7 43 = 43\n- 1 unit of Item 5: 1 \u00d7 79 = 79\n\nTotal retained value = 28 + 686 + 48 + 43 + 79 = 884\n\nNow, this retained value of 884 is greater than my outside offer of 789.\n\nTherefore, my initial action is to propose this counteroffer with the breakdown below:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 2, 1, 2]}\n```",

Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 6, 2, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    14 x 2 + 98 x 6 + 24 x 2 + 43 x 1 + 79 x 1\n    which is 786 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 789. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 2, 1, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 3, 1, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 3, 1, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To determine the best course of action, let's break down the situation step-by-step as instructed:\n\n### 1) Analyze the Current Situation:\n\n- **Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer value is 789.\n\n- **Values of the Items**:\n  - Item 1: 14\n  - Item 2: 98\n  - Item 3: 24\n  - Item 4: 43\n  - Item 5: 79\n\n- **Total Pool of Items**:\n  - Item 1: 2 units\n  - Item 2: 7 units\n  - Item 3: 2 units\n  - Item 4: 1 unit\n  - Item 5: 3 units\n\n- **Discount Factor**: The discount factor, gamma = 0.98, means if we accept in this second round, our realized value will be multiplied by 0.98^1 = 0.98. Therefore, we need to consider this multiplier when comparing offers to our outside offer.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n\n- **Current Offer [1, 3, 1, 0, 1]**:\n  - My value for these items:\n    - Item 1: 1 \u00d7 14 = 14\n    - Item 2: 3 \u00d7 98 = 294\n    - Item 3: 1 \u00d7 24 = 24\n    - Item 4: 0 \u00d7 43 = 0\n    - Item 5: 1 \u00d7 79 = 79\n  - Total value = 14 + 294 + 24 + 0 + 79 = 411\n  - Discounted value (accounts for 0.98 discount factor) = 411 \u00d7 0.98 = 402.78\n\n- **Comparison to Outside Offer**:\n  - Current offer (discounted) = 402.78\n  - Outside offer = 789\n\nThe current offer is much lower than my outside offer, even with the discount factor applied.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision:\n\n- Since the current offer's value to me (402.78) is less than my outside offer (789), it would be a Mistake 4 to accept it.\n\n- Rejecting the current offer does not incur mistakes. However, any counteroffer I make should consider offering less than what I am willing to accept.\n\n- **Counteroffer**: I should propose a division that retains higher value for me than my outside offer. Let's try offering Player 2 fewer high-value items.\n\nExample counteroffer: I retain [2, 4, 2, 1, 2] for my value calculation:\n  - My value for keeping this split:\n    - Item 1: 0 \u00d7 14 = 0\n    - Item 2: 3 \u00d7 98 = 294\n    - Item 3: 0 \u00d7 24 = 0\n    - Item 4: 0 \u00d7 43 = 0\n    - Item 5: 1 \u00d7 79 = 79\n  - Total value I give: 0 + 294 + 0 + 0 + 79 = 373 (less than the current offer)\n\nEstimating values based on the negotiation strategy:\n\n**Propose a new offer to Player 2**: [0, 3, 0, 0, 1], giving them some but less than my earlier offers.\n\nAfter calculating various permutations and considering what's left for them to gain, propose a mid-range offer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 0, 0, 2]}\n```\n\nThis maximizes my value and improves the value for Player 2 on less items, as gauged by their offer preference.",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 1, 4, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    31 x 1 + 90 x 1 + 73 x 1 + 13 x 4 + 49 x 1\n    which is 295 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 296. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values.

Therefore, reaching a favorable agreement sooner is beneficial, provided it meets or exceeds my outside offer value of 296.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers\n- **Value of Keeping All Items:** Let\u2019s calculate my total if I kept all items:\n  - Total value = (4 \\* 31) + (2 \\* 90) + (2 \\* 73) + (5 \\* 13) + (3 \\* 49) = 124 + 180 + 146 + 65 + 147 = 662\n  \nSince the total value of all items is significantly higher than my outside offer, I can afford to give away some items while ensuring my total value stays above 296.\n\n- **Potential Counteroffers:**\n  - I should devise a counteroffer that keeps my value above 296. Here's an example of an offer where I try keeping fewer items to give Player 2 items they possibly value more:\n    - Offer [1 unit of Item 1, 1 unit of Item 2, 1 unit of Item 3, 3 units of Item 4, 2 units of Item 5] to Player 2.\n    - I keep [3 units of Item 1, 1 unit of Item 2, 1 unit of Item 3, 2 units of Item 4, 1 unit of Item 5].\n\n  Let's assess the value of keeping those units for myself:\n  - Value = (3 \\* 31) + (1 \\* 90) + (1 \\* 73) + (2 \\* 13) + (1 \\* 49)\n  - Value = 93 + 90 + 73 + 26 + 49 = 331\n\n  This value of 331 is above my outside offer of 296, ensuring that I do not propose a counteroffer worse than my outside offer.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision\nSince I have calculated a counteroffer that maintains my payoff above my outside offer value, I will proceed with this initial proposal, hoping it leads to a beneficial negotiation outcome. \n\nTherefore, my action is:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 3, 2]}\n```",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 296. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 296. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 768 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 1, 4, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    31 x 1 + 90 x 1 + 73 x 1 + 13 x 4 + 49 x 1\n    which is 295 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 296. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

I want to retain more value than my outside offer:\n\nAssume:\n- Offer [0, 1, 2, 2, 1] to Player 2:\n  - For me:\n    - Item 1: 2 \u00d7 53 = 106\n    - Item 2: 4 \u00d7 73 = 292\n    - Item 3: 1 \u00d7 67 = 67\n    - Item 4: 1 \u00d7 93 = 93\n    - Item 5: 0 \u00d7 57 = 0\n  - Total value for me = 558, which is less than 583.\n\nInstead, let's evaluate another one:\n\nOffer [0, 2, 1, 1, 0] to Player 2:\n- For me:\n  - Item 1: 2 \u00d7 53 = 106\n  - Item 2: 3 \u00d7 73 = 219\n  - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 67 = 134\n  - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 93 = 186\n  - Item 5: 1 \u00d7 57 = 57\n- Total value for me = 702, which is higher than 583.\n\nHence, the counteroffer is valid and beneficial.\n\n4) Make a decision based on the analysis:\nSince there is no existing offer on the table and our calculation yields a favorable offer, it is prudent to propose the offer to Player 2:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 1, 1, 0]}",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 5, 1, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    53 x 0 + 73 x 5 + 67 x 1 + 93 x 1 + 57 x 1\n    which is 582 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 583. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 1, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 2, 3, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 3, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "prompt": "\n    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\n    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\n    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\n    There are 6 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\n    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\n    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 101.\n    Your private values are 58 for item 1, 48 for item 2, 33 for item 3, 71 for item 4, 58 for item 5.\n    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to your total value of all items, which is 990. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 893. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 893. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 804 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [6, 3, 1, 1, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    58 x 6 + 48 x 3 + 33 x 1 + 71 x 1 + 58 x 5\n    which is 886 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 893. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Since this is round 1, the discount factor is not yet applied, but it will be important to consider for future rounds.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers\n- **Current offer:** None (no current offer to assess)\n- **Potential counteroffers:**\n  - I need to propose a division where the value to me is greater than 893 to avoid mistakes 2 and 5.\n  - Let's calculate the value to me if I propose keeping most of the higher value items.\n\nLet's propose a counteroffer where I keep the majority of items to maximize my value without exceeding the outside offer.\n\n**Counteroffer Proposal: [n1, n2, n3, n4, n5]** where n1, n2, n3, n4, and n5 represent the units I give to Player 2:\n- Units of items to Player 2:\n  - Item 1: 2\n  - Item 2: 1\n  - Item 3: 1\n  - Item 4: 0\n  - Item 5: 2\n\n**Units of items I keep:**\n- Item 1: 4\n- Item 2: 2\n- Item 3: 1\n- Item 4: 2\n- Item 5: 3\n\n**My total value:**\n- 58 * 4 = 232 (Item 1)\n- 48 * 2 = 96 (Item 2)\n- 33 * 1 = 33 (Item 3)\n- 71 * 2 = 142 (Item 4)\n- 58 * 3 = 174 (Item 5)\n\nTotal value = 232 + 96 + 33 + 142 + 174 = 677\n\n### 3) Make a Decision\nThe calculated total value for me (677) is less than my outside offer value (893), which would be a mistake to propose as a counteroffer. I need to adjust my division proposal to ensure my value exceeds 893.\n\nLet's revise my approach:\nAdjust units to increase my achieved value:\n- Item 1: 5 (to me)\n- Item 2: 2 (to me)\n- Item 3: 2 (to me)\n- Item 4: 2 (to me)\n- Item 5: 4 (to me)\n\n**Revised Offer (given to Player 2):**\n- Item 1: 1\n- Item 2: 1\n- Item 3: 0\n- Item 4: 0\n- Item 5: 1\n\n**Recalculated My Value:**\n- 58 * 5 = 290 (Item 1)\n- 48 * 2 = 96 (Item 2)\n- 33 * 2 = 66 (Item 3)\n- 71 * 2 = 142 (Item 4)\n- 58 * 4 = 232 (Item 5)\n\nRevised Total value = 290 + 96 + 66 + 142 + 232 = 826\n\nUnfortunately, this still does not meet or exceed my outside offer as calculated. Let's try focusing on maximizing high-value retention further. Keep all high-value items:\n\n- Item 1: 6 (to me)\n- Item 2: 3 (to me)\n- Item 3: 2 (to me)\n- Item 4: 1 (to me)\n- Item 5: 2 (to me)\n\n**Final Revised Offer (given to Player 2):**\n- Item 1: 0\n- Item 2: 0\n- Item 3: 0\n- Item 4: 1\n- Item 5: 3\n\n**Re-evaluate My Value:**\n- 58 * 6 = 348 (Item 1)\n- 48 * 3 = 144 (Item 2)\n- 33 * 2 = 66 (Item 3)\n- 71 * 1 = 71 (Item 4)\n- 58 * 2 = 116 (Item 5)\n\nNew Total value = 348 + 144 + 66 + 71 + 116 = 745 (less value than desirable, need to adjust. No clear matching strategy among current quick checks.)\n\nLet's adjust for counter proposals closer aligned over more allocations without complete category focus. Offer low-value surplus alternative high-importance coverage. \n\nUltimately, direct outcome preferred offer is resolving toward maximizing and adjustment with single alterations again per duplicated value, further cycle:\n\nI will propose the elemental unit offer:\n- Item 1: 0\n- Item 2: 0\n- Item 3: 0\n- Item 4: 0\n- Item 5: 0\n\nThis essentially resets systematic patterns; retains enforced availances as similarly respective, proven effective under priority.

It's important to consider this decrement when evaluating future offers versus the current offer.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer:**  \n  There is no current offer from Player 2, so we must make the initial offer.\n\n- **Potential Counteroffers:**  \n  Let's evaluate a few potential offers to see if they provide a better value than the outside offer. The goal is to keep as much value as possible while proposing a fair offer that Player 2 might accept.\n\n  1. **Offer: [0, 0, 1, 1, 0] to Player 2:**  \n     - You keep: [2, 5, 2, 4, 7]  \n     - Value:  \n       \\(2 \\times 33 + 5 \\times 34 + 2 \\times 83 + 4 \\times 65 + 7 \\times 34 = 66 + 170 + 166 + 260 + 238 = 900\\)  \n     - This value is greater than your outside offer value (842).\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nGiven that the offer [0, 0, 1, 1, 0] allows us to keep a portion of every item type and results in a total value of 900, which is greater than your outside offer of 842, it seems like a reasonable starting offer.\n\nThe proposed offer should be appealing enough for Player 2 but still maximize our retained value well above the outside option.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 5, 2, 3, 7] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    33 x 2 + 34 x 5 + 83 x 2 + 65 x 3 + 34 x 7\n    which is 835 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 842. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 3, 2, 1, 5]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 3, 2, 1, 5]\n\n    What is your action?

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    80 x 0 + 33 x 1 + 30 x 0 + 28 x 0 + 91 x 0\n    which is 33 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 50. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 3, 0, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 3, 5, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 3, 5, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

This means if the negotiation takes longer than one round, the value of the accepted offer will be multiplied by 0.98 for the second round and 0.9604 for the third round.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n\nCurrently, there is **no offer** from Player 2 on the table.\n\n#### Consider Potential Counteroffers:\n\nWe want to propose an initial offer for Player 2 to consider. We need to ensure this offer retains a total value to us greater than 261, which is our outside offer value, and potentially leave value for Player 2, enticing them to consider it.\n\nLet's first calculate retaining all items to see their total value for us:\n\n- Total Value = (2 * 86) + (5 * 23) + (2 * 14) + (1 * 8) + (4 * 86) \n               = 172 + 115 + 28 + 8 + 344 \n               = 667 \n\nSince keeping all items is worth 667, we definitely want to propose keeping at least a portion that retains more value than 261.\n\n### Propose a Reasonable Division as a Counteroffer:\n\nLet's propose giving Player 2 some items that we value less while keeping items that we value highly. For instance:\n\n- Let's give away 1 unit of Item 2 (value 23) and 2 units of Item 3 (value 14 each) to Player 2.\n- Summary of Items to Player 2: [0, 1, 2, 0, 0]\n\nCalculate our retained value from this proposal:\n- Retained of Item 1: 2 \u00d7 86 = 172 \n- Retained of Item 2: 4 \u00d7 23 = 92 \n- Retained of Item 3: 0 \u00d7 14 = 0 \n- Retained of Item 4: 1 \u00d7 8 = 8 \n- Retained of Item 5: 4 \u00d7 86 = 344 \n\nTotal retained value = 172 + 92 + 0 + 8 + 344 = 616\n\nSince 616 > 261, this offer is better than our outside option.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision:\n\nBased on the analysis, the suggested offer gives us a total value greater than our outside offer and avoids the outlined mistakes.\n\nHere is my action:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 2, 0, 0]}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 1, 7, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    89 x 0 + 46 x 1 + 67 x 1 + 23 x 7 + 21 x 0\n    which is 274 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 275. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [5, 2, 3, 5, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 2, 4, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 2, 4, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 559. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 969 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 0, 3, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    90 x 3 + 20 x 0 + 96 x 3 + 76 x 0 + 41 x 0\n    which is 558 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 559. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Your value would be:\n    90 x 3 + 20 x 0 + 96 x 3 + 76 x 0 + 41 x 0\n    which is 558 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 559. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 0, 2, 7]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 3, 0, 0, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 3, 0, 3]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [3, 3, 1, 0, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 3, 1, 0, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 11. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 11. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 552 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    17 x 0 + 12 x 0 + 24 x 0 + 82 x 0 + 49 x 0\n    which is 0 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 11. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "To determine the best action, we need to evaluate the situation following the provided strategic guidelines.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n- **Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer value is 11.\n- **Values of Items**: \n  - Item 1: 17 per unit\n  - Item 2: 12 per unit\n  - Item 3: 24 per unit\n  - Item 4: 82 per unit\n  - Item 5: 49 per unit\n- **Total Pool of Items**: \n  - Item 1: 3 units\n  - Item 2: 3 units\n  - Item 3: 2 units\n  - Item 4: 3 units\n  - Item 5: 3 units\n- **Discount Factor**: The discount factor gamma is 0.98. This affects the value of future offers. If negotiations go to rounds 2 and 3, the present value of those rounds is multiplied by gamma each subsequent round.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n- **Current Offer**: There is no offer currently on the table, therefore I cannot assess an acceptance or rejection.\n  \n- **Evaluate Potential Counteroffers**: I need to ensure that any offer proposal gives me a value greater than my outside offer of 11. It's also strategic to secure as much value as possible.\n\nFor example:\n- If I propose that I keep all items: \n  - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51\n  - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36\n  - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 24 = 48\n  - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246\n  - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147\n  - **Total Value = 528**\n\nGiven the requirement to not offer all items to myself (as it\u2019s deemed suboptimal), and the necessity to provide a meaningful initial offer while still securing a value above 11, I can look to divide the items strategically.\n\nTo ensure Player 2 also considers the offer, I must offer a combination where I'm still satisfied above my outside offer, but not to the point where the offer is unacceptable from Player 2's perspective.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\nCreate a balanced initial offer with respect to the valuations:\n\n- Offer Player 2 fewer units of the high-value item 4 and item 5, potentially giving up some of the lower-valued items from my perspective (such as item 2 and item 1).\n\n#### Example Offer:\n- Offer 1 unit of item 1\n- Offer 2 units of item 2\n- Offer 0 units of item 3\n- Offer 1 unit of item 4\n- Offer 2 units of item 5\n\n**Value if I Keep:**\n- Item 1: (3-1) \u00d7 17 = 34\n- Item 2: (3-2) \u00d7 12 = 12\n- Item 3: (2-0) \u00d7 24 = 48\n- Item 4: (3-1) \u00d7 82 = 164\n- Item 5: (3-2) \u00d7 49 = 49\n- **Total Value = 307**\n\n**Compare to Outside Offer**: This value is definitely higher than my outside offer (11), thus this offer stands as a solid initial counter with the aim to maximize my value beyond simply taking the guaranteed fallback option.\n\nI will go with this strategy for my initial proposal.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 0, 1, 2]}\n```",

For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    17 x 0 + 12 x 0 + 24 x 0 + 82 x 0 + 49 x 0\n    which is 0 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 11. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Based on the negotiation history, Player 1 seems to value items 1, 2, and 5, while I highly value items 1 and 2. Item 4 is worth very little to me (only 6 per unit), so I should be willing to give all of those up.\n\nLet me try to make a counteroffer that gives me at least as much value as my outside offer while being potentially acceptable to Player 1:\n\nI'll keep:\n- 2 units of item 1 (2 \u00d7 56 = 112)\n- 3 units of item 2 (3 \u00d7 64 = 192)\n- 1 unit of item 3 (1 \u00d7 29 = 29)\n- 0 units of item 4 (0 \u00d7 6 = 0)\n- 2 units of item 5 (2 \u00d7 37 = 74)\n\nTotal value for me: 407, which after discount is 407 \u00d7 0.98 = 398.86\n\nThis means I'd offer Player 1:\n- 1 unit of item 1\n- 0 units of item 2\n- 1 unit of item 3\n- 3 units of item 4\n- 1 unit of item 5\n\nHowever, the current offer from Player 1 is already quite good for me and better than this counteroffer would be (since we'd lose another round of discount).

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

Therefore, in the first round, the discount factor has the least impact on my decision as (gamma)^(r-1) = (0.98)^0 = 1.\n   \n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Currently, there is no offer to evaluate, as I'm the first player to make an offer.\n   - I need to propose a counteroffer where my value is greater than my outside offer of 300.\n   - I want to avoid mistakes 2 and 3, so I should not offer more than what would leave me with less than my outside offer, and I should avoid giving all or none of the items unless there's strategic reason.\n\nLet's propose an initial offer where my value exceeds 300 while considering the potential value priorities of the other player. I will start by keeping as many high-value items to myself and offer a reasonable distribution:\n\n- My proposal:\n  - Offer Player 2:\n    - 1 unit of item 1: 1 \u00d7 34 = 34\n    - 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 56 = 56\n    - 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 89 = 178\n    - 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 3 = 3\n    - 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 37 = 74\n\n  So, I receive:\n  - 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 34 = 68\n  - 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 56 = 112\n  - 3 units of item 3: 3 \u00d7 89 = 267\n  - 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 3 = 3\n  - 3 units of item 5: 3 \u00d7 37 = 111\n\n- My total value: 68 + 112 + 267 + 3 + 111 = 561\n\nThis value, 561, is greater than my outside offer value of 300, which means it's a better alternative for me.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 1, 2, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    34 x 0 + 56 x 1 + 89 x 1 + 3 x 2 + 37 x 4\n    which is 299 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 300. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 2, 1, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 2, 0, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 2, 0, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

This means there's a small pressure to make or accept beneficial offers sooner rather than later.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n   - There is no current offer to accept.\n   - To make the first offer, I need to ensure the value of items I keep is higher than my outside offer value of 601. Let's experiment with a few distributions:\n     - Let's start by trying to offer Player 2 a configuration and assessing its value:\n       ```\n       Offer to Player 2: [1, 5, 1, 2, 1]\n       ```\n       This means I keep [5, 4, 2, 3, 1].\n\n       Calculating the value to me:\n       - Value of item 1 = 5 x 65 = 325\n       - Value of item 2 = 4 x 94 = 376\n       - Value of item 3 = 2 x 56 = 112\n       - Value of item 4 = 3 x 62 = 186\n       - Value of item 5 = 1 x 20 = 20\n       - Total value = 325 + 376 + 112 + 186 + 20 = 1019\n\n   - 1019 is much higher than my outside offer value of 601.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 601. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 891 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 2, 3, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    65 x 0 + 94 x 3 + 56 x 2 + 62 x 3 + 20 x 1\n    which is 600 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 601. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 5, 1, 2, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 7, 2, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 7, 2, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

However, since I am receiving an offer of 879.06 whereas my counteroffer was rejected in round 1, Player 2 might not accept and we might end in a worse deal.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision Based on the Analysis\n\nGiven that my value from the current offer (879.06) is already much higher than my outside option and already better than most reasonable counteroffers I can hope to get without real evidence that player 2 will accept, it is rational for me to accept this offer.\n\nSo, my decision is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 25. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 873 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    97 x 0 + 19 x 1 + 91 x 0 + 17 x 0 + 67 x 0\n    which is 19 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 25. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "prompt": "\n    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\n    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\n    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\n    There are 6 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\n    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\n    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 101.\n    Your private values are 45 for item 1, 55 for item 2, 17 for item 3, 68 for item 4, 47 for item 5.\n    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to your total value of all items, which is 1158. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 222. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 222. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 696 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 3, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    45 x 0 + 55 x 0 + 17 x 1 + 68 x 3 + 47 x 0\n    which is 221 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 222. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 3, 0, 3, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 2, 1, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 1, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To make a decision, let's analyze the current situation and offers systematically:\n\n1) **Analyze the Current Situation:**\n   - **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer is valued at 222.\n   - **Values of Items Involved:**\n     - Item 1: 45 per unit\n     - Item 2: 55 per unit\n     - Item 3: 17 per unit\n     - Item 4: 68 per unit\n     - Item 5: 47 per unit\n   - **Total Pool of Items:**\n     - 6 units of Item 1, 5 units of Item 2, 1 unit of Item 3, 6 units of Item 4, 4 units of Item 5.\n   - **Discount Factor Influence:** Since it's round 2, the discount factor (gamma = 0.98) influences the total value by a multiplier of 0.98^1 = 0.98.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n   - **Current Offer:** [1, 2, 1, 2, 1]\n     - Total value if I accept it:\n       - Item 1: 1 x 45 = 45\n       - Item 2: 2 x 55 = 110\n       - Item 3: 1 x 17 = 17\n       - Item 4: 2 x 68 = 136\n       - Item 5: 1 x 47 = 47\n       - Total before discount = 355\n       - Total with discount = 355 x 0.98 = 348.9\n     Since 348.9 is greater than my outside offer of 222, this offer is better than walking away.\n\n   - **Potential Counteroffers:**\n     - Let's consider making a counteroffer that offers Player 2 a different set of item quantities, ensuring the value I retain is greater than my outside offer.\n     - I must avoid offering anything that results in a value less than 222 for myself and try improving the position further compared to the current offer value.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n   - The current offer already yields a total value of 348.9 after discount, which is better than my outside offer.\n   - It's important to recognize that improving the offer might be challenging, considering possible responses and the need to avoid mistakes like making an offer worse for myself than the current situation.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most advantageous action would be to accept the current offer, as it already provides a reasonable outcome compared to my outside option and ensures a satisfactory payoff.\n\nTherefore, my action is: \n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",
