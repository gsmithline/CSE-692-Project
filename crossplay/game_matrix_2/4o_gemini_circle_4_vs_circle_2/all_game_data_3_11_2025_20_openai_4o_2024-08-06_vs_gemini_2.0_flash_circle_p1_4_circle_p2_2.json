Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 606. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 639 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "To determine the best course of action, I'll walk through the steps provided:\n\n1) **Analyze the Current Situation:**\n   - **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 606.\n   - **Values of the Items Involved:**\n     - Item 1: 7 per unit\n     - Item 2: 88 per unit\n     - Item 3: 86 per unit\n     - Item 4: 20 per unit\n     - Item 5: 12 per unit\n   - **Total Pool of Items:**\n     - 5 units of Item 1\n     - 3 units of Item 2\n     - 5 units of Item 3\n     - 3 units of Item 4\n     - 4 units of Item 5\n   - **Discount Factor Influence:**\n     - Since it's round 1, any agreement reached would not be discounted (as \\( \\gamma^{0} = 1 \\)). Delaying acceptance or waiting for future offers will involve the discount factor in subsequent rounds.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n   - **Current Offer:** None, as it's the first round.\n   - As there is no current offer, I can't calculate a value for accepting it.\n   - **Potential Counteroffers:**\n     - I will consider a few potential allocations to explore my options:\n       - **Offer A: [1, 1, 2, 1, 1] offered to Player 2, therefore keeping 4 of Item 1, 2 of Item 2, 3 of Item 3, 2 of Item 4, 3 of Item 5 for myself:**\n         - Value to me = \\(4 \\times 7 + 2 \\times 88 + 3 \\times 86 + 2 \\times 20 + 3 \\times 12 = 28 + 176 + 258 + 40 + 36 = 538\\)\n         - This offer's value is less than my outside offer (538 < 606), so it's worse.\n       - **Offer B: [2, 1, 2, 1, 1] offered to Player 2, therefore keeping 3 of Item 1, 2 of Item 2, 3 of Item 3, 2 of Item 4, 3 of Item 5 for myself:**\n         - Value to me = \\(3 \\times 7 + 2 \\times 88 + 3 \\times 86 + 2 \\times 20 + 3 \\times 12 = 21 + 176 + 258 + 40 + 36 = 531\\)\n         - This offer's value is again less than my outside offer (531 < 606).\n\nSince both potential offers calculated result in a value less than my outside offer, I conclude that any initial counteroffer should be calibrated to exceed the 606 threshold to be a valid action. The goal would be to propose a division that ensures a fallback value greater than 606.\n\n3) **Make a Decision Based on the Analysis:**\n   - I shall propose an offer that ensures a division more favorable than my outside offer by doing some trial and error adjustment keeping higher-value items.\n   - **Propose the following counteroffer: [1, 0, 2, 0, 2]**\n     - Retaining 4 of Item 1, 3 of Item 2, 3 of Item 3, 3 of Item 4, 2 of Item 5 for myself:\n       - Value = \\(4 \\times 7 + 3 \\times 88 + 3 \\times 86 + 3 \\times 20 + 2 \\times 12 = 28 + 264 + 258 + 60 + 24 = 634\\)\n     - This is more than 606, so it meets the criteria.\n\nWith these calculations, I ensure I am not making Mistake 2 or Mistake 3, and I also retain a division that's clearly more favorable than my outside value.

My goal is to maximize my value, taking into account the discount factor in future rounds. Since this is the first round, the discount factor is 0.98^(1-1) = 1. I need to consider what a plausible counteroffer might be that Player 1 would accept.\n\nLet's calculate the total value of all items:\n(5 * 73) + (3 * 91) + (5 * 40) + (3 * 86) + (4 * 67) = 365 + 273 + 200 + 258 + 268 = 1364\n\nIf I offer Player 1 half of each item, it would be:\nItem 1: 2.5\nItem 2: 1.5\nItem 3: 2.5\nItem 4: 1.5\nItem 5: 2\n\nSince we can only offer whole units, let's try giving Player 1 [2, 1, 2, 1, 2].  This leaves me with [3, 2, 3, 2, 2].\nMy value would then be:\n(3 * 73) + (2 * 91) + (3 * 40) + (2 * 86) + (2 * 67) = 219 + 182 + 120 + 172 + 134 = 827\n\nSince 827 > 330, this counteroffer would be better than walking away if it is accepted.

This means the value of offers becomes slightly less favorable with each passing round because the overall multiplier for evaluating my net gain decreases slightly, affecting the net value of the deal.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n- **Current Offer to Me: [2, 1, 2, 1, 2]**\n\n  Calculating the total value if I accept the current offer:\n  - 2 units of Item 1 = 2 \u00d7 7 = 14\n  - 1 unit of Item 2 = 1 \u00d7 88 = 88\n  - 2 units of Item 3 = 2 \u00d7 86 = 172\n  - 1 unit of Item 4 = 1 \u00d7 20 = 20\n  - 2 units of Item 5 = 2 \u00d7 12 = 24\n  - Total value = 318\n\n  Since it's round 2, adjust for the discount:\n  - Total value with discount = 318 \u00d7 0.98 = 311.64\n\n- **Comparison to Outside Offer:** \n  - The current offer's value (311.64) is significantly lower than the outside offer value (606).\n\n- **Potential Counteroffers:** We need to propose an offer where the total value for me is greater than 606, while still being acceptable to Player 2.\n  - A possible counteroffer might be [1, 0, 2, 0, 2], the offer from Round 1. Reevaluate its value for reference:\n  - Keep: [4, 3, 3, 3, 2]\n  - Total value of keeping:\n      - 4 units of Item 1 = 4 \u00d7 7 = 28\n      - 3 units of Item 2 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264\n      - 3 units of Item 3 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258\n      - 3 units of Item 4 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60\n      - 2 units of Item 5 = 2 \u00d7 12 = 24\n  - Total value = 634\n\n  Adjusted for discount in round 2, the total = 634 \u00d7 0.98 = 621.32.\n\n### 3) Decision Making:\n- **Current Offer Value Consideration:** The current offer is less valuable than my outside offer (311.64 vs. 606).\n  \n- **Potential Counteroffer Consideration:** The counter from Round 1 yields a value of 621.32 with discount, which is better than the outside offer.\n\nBased on this analysis, the best action is to make a counteroffer that improves my position compared to the current offer and makes it better than my outside option.

Since 281.26 < 330, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away and taking my outside offer.\n\nNow, let's consider a counteroffer. I want to find an offer that Player 1 might accept, which also exceeds my outside offer of 330. I need to keep in mind Player 1's valuation, which is unknown to me.\n\nI will make a counteroffer that is slightly more favorable to me, compared to the initial offers, but still gives player 1 something.

                    "response": "To make an informed decision, let's carefully analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n### 1) Analyze the current situation:\n\n- **Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer value is 606. This is our guaranteed fallback option, which gives us a value of 606 if we choose to walk away.\n\n- **Values of the Items**:\n  - Item 1: 7 per unit\n  - Item 2: 88 per unit\n  - Item 3: 86 per unit\n  - Item 4: 20 per unit\n  - Item 5: 12 per unit\n\n- **Total Pool of Items**:\n  - 5 units of item 1\n  - 3 units of item 2\n  - 5 units of item 3\n  - 3 units of item 4\n  - 4 units of item 5\n\n- **Discount Factor**: We're at round 3, so while the discount rate is 0.98, the power applied here is \\(3-1 = 2\\). This makes future offers slightly less attractive due to this factor:\n\n  \\[\n  \\text{Discount Factor for Current Round (Round 3)} = 0.98^2 = 0.9604\n  \\]\n\n### 2) Assess the value of offers:\n\n- **Current Offer [1, 0, 2, 0, 1]**:\n  - Item 1: 1 unit \u00d7 7 = 7\n  - Item 2: 0 units \u00d7 88 = 0\n  - Item 3: 2 units \u00d7 86 = 172\n  - Item 4: 0 units \u00d7 20 = 0\n  - Item 5: 1 unit \u00d7 12 = 12\n  - Total Value = 7 + 0 + 172 + 0 + 12 = 191\n\n  Adjusted for Discount Factor:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Adjusted Value} = 191 \\times 0.9604 = 183.4284\n  \\]\n\n  Since 183.4284 is less than our outside offer of 606, accepting this offer is not favorable.\n\n- **Current Counteroffer**:\n  - Given we're in the last round, instead of countering, the priority is to accept or walk based on current values.\n\n### 3) Decision-making:\n\n- **Evaluate Accepting**: The adjusted current offer value is 183.4284, which is less than the outside offer of 606. Thus, accepting this offer would be a mistake (Mistake 4), as it delivers less value than walking away with the guarantee of 606.\n\n- **Evaluate Walking Away**: Secures me an offer of 606.\n\n- **Evaluate Counteroffering**: Since it's the last round, counteroffer is essentially a walk action.\n\nGiven this analysis and the parameters of the situation, walking away is the mechanically optimal decision as it avoids accepting a suboptimal offer and aligns with my interests.\n \nThus, the final decision is:\n  \n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 114. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player1, 2 units of each item (keeping 2 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 708 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the current offer and decide on the best action.\n\nThe current offer gives me:\n- 1 unit of item 1\n- 2 units of item 2\n- 1 unit of item 3\n- 1 unit of item 4\n- 1 unit of item 5\n\nMy values for these items are:\n- Item 1: 50\n- Item 2: 39\n- Item 3: 1\n- Item 4: 47\n- Item 5: 99\n\nSo the value of the current offer to me is:\n(1 * 50) + (2 * 39) + (1 * 1) + (1 * 47) + (1 * 99) = 50 + 78 + 1 + 47 + 99 = 275\n\nMy outside offer is 114.

Since I'm in Round 1, I'll consider a counteroffer that gives Player 1 slightly more than what they initially requested, while still giving me a good outcome.\nLet's try offering the following to Player 1:\n- 1 unit of item 1\n- 1 unit of item 2\n- 3 unit of item 3\n- 2 unit of item 4\n- 2 unit of item 5\n\nThis would leave me with:\n- 3 units of item 1\n- 2 units of item 2\n- 2 units of item 3\n- 1 units of item 4\n- 2 units of item 5\n\nMy value for this would be:\n(3 * 50) + (2 * 39) + (2 * 1) + (1 * 47) + (2 * 99) = 150 + 78 + 2 + 47 + 198 = 475\n\nNow, let me offer player1\n- 1 unit of item 1\n- 1 unit of item 2\n- 3 unit of item 3\n- 2 unit of item 4\n- 2 unit of item 5\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 3, 2, 2]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

                    "response": "To proceed, let's follow the outlined step-by-step analysis:\n\n### 1) Analyze the current situation:\n\n- **Outside offer value**: 1626\n- **Values of the items involved**:\n  - Item 1: 71 per unit\n  - Item 2: 99 per unit\n  - Item 3: 72 per unit\n  - Item 4: 66 per unit\n  - Item 5: 80 per unit\n\n- **Total pool of items**:\n  - Item 1: 7 units\n  - Item 2: 8 units\n  - Item 3: 2 units\n  - Item 4: 4 units\n  - Item 5: 5 units\n\n- **Discount factor**: The discount factor, gamma = 0.98, implies that the value of an offer in future rounds (r) is multiplied by 0.98^(r-1). Since we are currently in round 1, this does not affect the current offer immediately but must be considered for any future rounds.\n\n### 2) Assess the value of offers:\n\n- **Current offer**: There is no current offer on the table.\n- **Potential counteroffers**:\n  - Calculate the total value of keeping X units of each item:\n    - Full possession value: \n      - Item 1: 7 \u00d7 71 = 497\n      - Item 2: 8 \u00d7 99 = 792\n      - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 72 = 144\n      - Item 4: 4 \u00d7 66 = 264\n      - Item 5: 5 \u00d7 80 = 400\n      - Total value of all items: 2097\n\n- **Comparison with outside offer**:\n  - The item pool's full value is 2097 for me, more than my outside offer of 1626. Hence, it is potentially beneficial to negotiate.\n\n### 3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n\nI have no offer to consider, so I must propose an initial offer. The key is to propose a division of items in which the value received by me is more than my outside offer value (1626) and more than the current round's value considering the discount for any reasonable counteroffer that Player 2 might propose.\n\nTo ensure my strategy maximizes my payout while still, potentially, being acceptable to Player 2, I should aim to keep the total value of the items I retain above my outside offer while keeping my counteroffer reasonable.\n\nLet\u2019s calculate an initial counteroffer where I keep more valuable items, ensuring I don't fall into decision mistakes outlined:\n\nFor offer to Player 2:\n- Give 3 units of Item 1 (3 \u00d7 71 = 213 value retained by me)\n- Give 4 units of Item 2 (792 value retained by me as 4 units of Item 2 kept)\n- Give 0 units of Item 3 (144)\n- Give 2 units of Item 4 (132 value retained by me) \n- Give 3 units of Item 5 (160 value retained by me)\n\nCalculation of total retained value:\n- 4 units of Item 1 retained by me: 4 \u00d7 71 = 284\n- 4 units of Item 2 retained by me: 4 \u00d7 99 = 396\n- 2 units of Item 3 retained by me: 2 \u00d7 72 = 144\n- 2 units of Item 4 retained by me: 2 \u00d7 66 = 132\n- 2 units of Item 5 retained by me: 2 \u00d7 80 = 160\n- Total retained value: 284 + 396 + 144 + 132 + 160 = 1116\n\nThis offer allows me to retain a value of 1116, which is safe as it is significantly less than the total item pool value (2097), and could potentially be increased by further negotiations, accepting that the initial value is lower than my outside offer (1626), but positions me well to negotiate upwards in subsequent rounds.\n\nGiven this consideration, my initial action is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 4, 0, 2, 3]}\n```",

Therefore, I should either walk away or make a counteroffer.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. To maximize my value, I want to keep items 3 and 4 for myself, since they have the highest value. I also want to get as many units of each as possible.\n\nI have:\n- 7 units of item 1\n- 8 units of item 2\n- 2 units of item 3\n- 4 units of item 4\n- 5 units of item 5\n\nI could offer player 1 the items that I value the least, like items 1, 2 and 5. Let's calculate how much I would value keeping the maximum amount of items 3 and 4 for myself.\n\nIf I keep all the items 3 and 4 for myself, and offer all the items 1, 2 and 5 to Player 1, then my counteroffer would be [7, 8, 0, 0, 5]. This means I would be receiving: 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5. The value of this would be (0*25) + (0*32) + (2*62) + (4*66) + (0*32) = 0 + 0 + 124 + 264 + 0 = 388. This value is worse than my outside offer of 754.\n\nLet's try offering something more reasonable to Player 1. My outside option is 754, so the value of any counteroffer I make to Player 1 that I would accept would need to be better than that *discounted*, ie. at least (754)/(0.98) = 769.39 in Round 2.\n\nSuppose I offer Player 1 half the items. My counteroffer would be [3, 4, 1, 2, 2]. This means I receive [4, 4, 1, 2, 3].\nThe value to me is (4*25) + (4*32) + (1*62) + (2*66) + (3*32) = 100 + 128 + 62 + 132 + 96 = 518.\nSince 518 < 754, this is worse than walking away.\n\nI think the best course of action here is to walk away.\nI will choose to WALK.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

In this round, r = 1, so no discount applies.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n   - There is currently no offer on the table from Player 2, so I need to make an initial offer.\n   - I must ensure that the value I receive from any offer I propose exceeds my outside offer value of 239.\n   - If I keep more valuable items or a greater quantity of high-value items, the total value I end up with should surpass 239.\n\n3) **Make a Decision Based on the Analysis:**\n   - I need to propose an initial offer that allows me to receive a total value greater than 239.\n   - I will keep items with high values for me and propose giving Player 2 more of the lower-value items for me.\n   \nLet's calculate some potential divisions:\n\n- Allocate myself 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5, as these have the highest per-unit values for me and some units of lower-value items:\n  - My value for keeping:\n    - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 33 = 33\n    - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 74 = 148\n    - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 21 = 42\n    - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 66 = 132\n    - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 63 = 126\n  - Total value if I keep: 33 + 148 + 42 + 132 + 126 = 481\n  \nWith this proposed division, I keep items worth a total of 481 points, which is well above my outside offer value of 239.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the current offer and determine the best course of action.\n\nThe current offer on the table is [2, 1, 5, 1, 2], meaning I receive 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n\nLet's calculate the value of this offer to me:\n* Item 1: 2 * 9 = 18\n* Item 2: 1 * 17 = 17\n* Item 3: 5 * 27 = 135\n* Item 4: 1 * 18 = 18\n* Item 5: 2 * 84 = 168\nTotal value of the offer = 18 + 17 + 135 + 18 + 168 = 356\n\nMy outside offer is 490. Since the current offer (356) is less than my outside offer, I should not accept it immediately.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. To maximize my outcome, I want to obtain an offer that is significantly better than my outside offer, accounting for the discount factor in later rounds. Since this is Round 1, the discount factor doesn't heavily influence my decision yet. However, since there are 3 rounds, I need to factor it in.\n\nA potential strategy could be to aim for an equal split, where I receive half of the total available value.\n\nTotal available units:\nItem 1: 3\nItem 2: 3\nItem 3: 7\nItem 4: 3\nItem 5: 4\n\nMy values:\nItem 1: 9\nItem 2: 17\nItem 3: 27\nItem 4: 18\nItem 5: 84\n\nTotal value if I get all items: (3*9) + (3*17) + (7*27) + (3*18) + (4*84) = 27 + 51 + 189 + 54 + 336 = 657\n\nSo, I want to get more than 490. Let me try to make a counteroffer that is more favorable to me. I'll try to get all of item 5 and most of item 3. Let's offer Player 1 a little less than half of the resources.\n\nOffer: [2, 2, 4, 2, 0]\nThis means I would get:\nItem 1: 3-2=1\nItem 2: 3-2=1\nItem 3: 7-4=3\nItem 4: 3-2=1\nItem 5: 4-0=4\n\nMy value with this division:\n(1*9) + (1*17) + (3*27) + (1*18) + (4*84) = 9 + 17 + 81 + 18 + 336 = 461. This is still less than the outside offer.\n\nI need to be more aggressive to account for the potential discount in later rounds. I'll offer a counteroffer that gives me more.\n\nOffer: [1, 1, 3, 1, 0]\nI get:\nItem 1: 3-1=2\nItem 2: 3-1=2\nItem 3: 7-3=4\nItem 4: 3-1=2\nItem 5: 4-0=4\n\nMy value: (2*9) + (2*17) + (4*27) + (2*18) + (4*84) = 18 + 34 + 108 + 36 + 336 = 532\n\nThis offer of 532 is now higher than the outside offer of 490.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 3, 1, 0]}\n```",

As this is the first round, the discount factor doesn't apply yet. However, if the negotiation prolongs, this factor will reduce the effective value in subsequent rounds. \n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n1. **Current Offer**:\n   - There is no offer on the table currently.\n\n2. **Potential Counteroffers**:\n   - Since this is my initial move, I'll propose a division where my total value exceeds or is close to my outside offer (930), while still being reasonable for Player 2 to consider.\n\n3. **Comparison to Outside Offer**:\n   - To beat my outside offer, I must propose a division where my value exceeds 930 when no discount applies.\n\n### Step 3: Decision Making\n\n1. **Propose Counteroffer**:\n   - I'll calculate an offer that gives me a total value as high as possible, but keeping Player 2 in mind to ensure it's reasonable.\n   \n   **Allocation for maximized personal value**:\n   - Item 1: Keep 2 (2 x 58 = 116)\n   - Item 2: Keep 3, Give 1 to Player 2 (3 x 72 = 216), Total 288\n   - Item 3: Keep 2 (2 x 58 = 116)\n   - Item 4: Keep 3, Give 1 to Player 2 (3 x 100 = 300), Total 400\n   - Item 5: Keep 3, Give 2 to Player 2 (3 x 24 = 72), Total 120\n   \n   **My value for this offer**:\n   - 116 (Item 1) + 288 (Item 2) + 116 (Item 3) + 300 (Item 4) + 72 (Item 5) = 892\n   \n   Although 892 is slightly less than my outside offer of 930, it provides a reasonable initial negotiation position ensuring Player 2 receives something attractive.

I need to aim higher. I will give them a small piece of item 3 because I value it highly. I will concede on item 5, and item 2. I'll also give them half of item 4 and item 1.\n\n* Item 1: 1 unit\n* Item 2: 2 units\n* Item 3: 0 unit\n* Item 4: 2 units\n* Item 5: 4 units\n\nThis would leave me with:\n* Item 1: 1 unit\n* Item 2: 2 unit\n* Item 3: 2 units\n* Item 4: 2 units\n* Item 5: 1 unit\n\nMy value for this would be:\n* Item 1: 1 * 12 = 12\n* Item 2: 2 * 6 = 12\n* Item 3: 2 * 70 = 140\n* Item 4: 2 * 15 = 30\n* Item 5: 1 * 39 = 39\n* Total value: 12 + 12 + 140 + 30 + 39 = 233. Still too low. Let me offer them:\n\n* Item 1: 1 unit\n* Item 2: 3 units\n* Item 3: 0 unit\n* Item 4: 3 units\n* Item 5: 4 units\n\nThis would leave me with:\n* Item 1: 1 unit\n* Item 2: 1 unit\n* Item 3: 2 units\n* Item 4: 1 units\n* Item 5: 1 unit\n\nMy value for this would be:\n* Item 1: 1 * 12 = 12\n* Item 2: 1 * 6 = 6\n* Item 3: 2 * 70 = 140\n* Item 4: 1 * 15 = 15\n* Item 5: 1 * 39 = 39\n* Total value: 12 + 6 + 140 + 15 + 39 = 212. It appears I cannot get more than 250 easily.\n\nI will walk.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 653. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 762 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Therefore, it's important to consider immediate offers that satisfy or exceed my outside offer value.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n#### Current Offer:\n- There is no current offer on the table as this is round 1.\n\n#### Potential Counteroffers:\nTo ensure a counteroffer is worthwhile, I need the total value of items I keep to meet or exceed my outside offer value (653). I must decide how to divide the items so that this condition is met. \n\nLet's consider various divisions through some calculations:\n\n1. **Proposal 1: Strong initial offer to approach my outside offer value**\n   - Keep: [5 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5]\n   - Give: [2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5]\n\n   **Value Calculation**:\n   - 5 units of item 1: \\(5 \\times 47 = 235\\)\n   - 1 unit of item 2: \\(1 \\times 3 = 3\\)\n   - 2 units of item 3: \\(2 \\times 70 = 140\\)\n   - 3 units of item 4: \\(3 \\times 36 = 108\\)\n   - 1 unit of item 5: \\(1 \\times 98 = 98\\)\n   - Total value: \\(235 + 3 + 140 + 108 + 98 = 584\\)\n\nWith this higher offer, I'm considering the initial round's negotiation room to potentially adjust if necessary while attempting to maximize retained value before discounting in future rounds.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\n- I need a solution where my retained value is close to or exceeding my outside offer value due to the absence of a current offer. My initial counterproposal must be more valuable than my outside offer when adjusted for discount factor impacts and negotiation potential.\n- Proposal 2 does suit my objective better initially without risking immediate rejection.\n\nGiven the above considerations, my decision will be to propose a counteroffer structured to maximize my outcomes. \n\nMy decision is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 3, 2, 1]}\n``` \n\nThis offer balances keeping a significant portion of high-value items while considering negotiation strategy.",

My goal is to maximize my total value while ensuring it's better than my outside offer.\n   - I should avoid mistakes, especially offering less value than my outside offer.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - I will propose a division where the total value for me is greater than my outside offer (343) after considering the discount in future rounds.\n   - My strategy is to keep more units of higher-value items and propose an offer that secures a significant portion of the total value for myself while also not being unfavorable for Player 2.\n\nSince I don't have information on Player 2's values, I'll propose a balanced offer: \n\nLet's consider the following offer where I keep more units of the high-value items for myself:\n\n- Give Player 2: \n  - 1 unit of item 1\n  - 2 units of item 2\n  - 0 units of item 3\n  - 2 units of item 4\n  - 3 units of item 5\n\nLet's calculate my total value for the offer I'm proposing:\n\n- My total value:\n  - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 75 = 150 (I keep 2 out of 3)\n  - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 17 = 34 (I keep 2 out of 4)\n  - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 42 = 84 (I keep 2 out of 2)\n  - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (I keep 3 out of 5)\n  - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 6 = 12 (I keep 2 out of 5)\n\nTotal value for me = 150 + 34 + 84 + 138 + 12 = 418\n\n418 is greater than my outside offer of 343. Thus, this offer is preferable over my outside offer in the first round.\n\nSince there is no current offer to accept, I will make a counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 0, 2, 3]}\n```",

Let's calculate the value of this offer to me:\n\n*   Item 1: 1 * 98 = 98\n*   Item 2: 2 * 62 = 124\n*   Item 3: 0 * 15 = 0\n*   Item 4: 2 * 17 = 34\n*   Item 5: 3 * 70 = 210\n*   Total value: 98 + 124 + 0 + 34 + 210 = 466\n\nMy outside offer is 497.  Since 466 < 497, accepting the current offer would be worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. To do this effectively, I need to think about what Player 1 might value the items at. However, without knowing their values, I'll aim for a division that gives me more than my outside offer while being somewhat reasonable for Player 1.\n\nLet's try offering Player 1 half of each item (rounding up if necessary).\n* Item 1: Total 3, offer 2 to player 1.\n* Item 2: Total 4, offer 2 to player 1.\n* Item 3: Total 2, offer 1 to player 1.\n* Item 4: Total 5, offer 3 to player 1.\n* Item 5: Total 5, offer 3 to player 1.\n\nThis means I would have:\n* Item 1: 1 unit.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the current offer on the table. Player 1 is offering me [1, 1, 2, 4, 1] units of items 1 through 5, respectively. My values for these items are 94, 68, 87, 90, and 8. So the value of this offer to me is:\n\n(1 * 94) + (1 * 68) + (2 * 87) + (4 * 90) + (1 * 8) = 94 + 68 + 174 + 360 + 8 = 704\n\nSince this is round 1, the discount factor is 0.98^(1-1) = 1. Therefore, the present value of this offer is 704.\n\nMy outside offer is 1333. Since 704 < 1333, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. I have the following quantities of items: 2 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 8 of item 4, and 3 of item 5.\n\nI want to maximize my value, and I know the negotiation can last for 3 rounds with a discount factor of 0.98 each round.\n\nSince this is round 1, if I walk away I get 1333. If I make a counteroffer, Player 1 might accept it, or they might make another counteroffer in round 2. If we reach round 3, I will just walk away.\n\nTo decide on a counteroffer, I want to offer Player 1 an amount that would make them indifferent between accepting and making another counteroffer. However, I don't know Player 1's values, so this approach isn't feasible. Instead, I will make a counteroffer which is better than my walk away value, assuming that player 1 has values high enough to make them accept it. I'll start by proposing dividing the items evenly, rounding up to the nearest whole unit for player 1 (since I have a very high walk away value).\n\nSo, I offer Player 1:\nItem 1: 1 unit\nItem 2: 1 unit\nItem 3: 2 units\nItem 4: 4 units\nItem 5: 2 units\n\nThis means I keep:\nItem 1: 1 unit\nItem 2: 1 unit\nItem 3: 2 units\nItem 4: 4 units\nItem 5: 1 unit\n\nMy value from this counteroffer would be:\n(1 * 94) + (1 * 68) + (2 * 87) + (4 * 90) + (1 * 8) = 94 + 68 + 174 + 360 + 8 = 704\n\nIf I offer more to Player 1, say keeping nothing for myself:\nOffer to Player 1: [2, 2, 4, 8, 3]\nThen my total is 0, so that's bad.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer such that my value is higher than my walk away value (1333).\nIf Player 1 gets nothing, I get everything, and my value is:\n(2 * 94) + (2 * 68) + (4 * 87) + (8 * 90) + (3 * 8) = 188 + 136 + 348 + 720 + 24 = 1416\n\nOkay, so I want to make a counteroffer such that I get more than 1333. Let's start by giving nothing of value to Player 1. Offer Player 1 [0,0,0,0,0]. My value is 1416, which is higher than my walkaway, and maybe Player 1's walk away is not as high.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n",

It's generally better to try and conclude earlier to capture more value.\n\n2. **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n\n   - **Current Offer on the Table:** [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n     - Total value if I accept this: 0, which is certainly worse than my outside offer of 9.\n\n   - **Value of Original Offer (Round 1 Offer):** [1, 1, 2, 4, 1]\n     - Value to me = (1 \u00d7 8) + (1 \u00d7 3) + (2 \u00d7 10) + (4 \u00d7 65) + (1 \u00d7 23) = 8 + 3 + 20 + 260 + 23 = 314\n     - This offer was quite favorable compared to my outside offer.\n\n   - **Potential Counteroffers:**\n     Since my objective is to maximize the value of the outcome, I might want to aim for a division that brings me as close to the total value while being reasonable.\n\n     Let's propose a counteroffer where I keep most of the high-value items:\n     - Offer: [0, 0, 2, 4, 1]\n     - Calculating the value I keep from this offer:\n       - Total value to me = (2 \u00d7 8) + (2 \u00d7 3) + (2 \u00d7 10) + (4 \u00d7 65) + (2 \u00d7 23) = 16 + 6 + 20 + 260 + 46 = 348.\n\n3. **Make a Decision Based on the Analysis:**\n\n   - The current offer of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] is unacceptable since it yields a value of 0, far below my outside offer of 9.\n   - Rather than walk away, it makes sense to propose a counteroffer that respects my desire to maximize my value:\n     - The counteroffer [0, 0, 2, 4, 1] nets me a value of 348, which is significantly higher than my outside offer and my possible efficiency in subsequent rounds with discounting.\n\nBased on this analysis, here's the action I'll take:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 2, 4, 1]}\n```",

This means I get 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 4 of item 4, and 1 of item 5.\n\nMy values are:\n- Item 1: 94\n- Item 2: 68\n- Item 3: 87\n- Item 4: 90\n- Item 5: 8\n\nSo, the value of the current offer is:\n(0 * 94) + (0 * 68) + (2 * 87) + (4 * 90) + (1 * 8) = 0 + 0 + 174 + 360 + 8 = 542\n\nSince it is round 2, we need to discount this value. The discount factor is 0.98, so we multiply the value of the offer by 0.98^(2-1) = 0.98.\nDiscounted value = 542 * 0.98 = 531.16\n\nMy outside offer is 1333.\n\nSince 531.16 < 1333, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. I want to maximize my value, so I need to offer Player 1 something that they will accept but also leaves me with a value greater than 1333/0.98 = 1360.2.\n\nLet's see what a fair split would look like. We have:\n- Item 1: 2 units\n- Item 2: 2 units\n- Item 3: 4 units\n- Item 4: 8 units\n- Item 5: 3 units\n\nMy total value is: (2 * 94) + (2 * 68) + (4 * 87) + (8 * 90) + (3 * 8) = 188 + 136 + 348 + 720 + 24 = 1416\n\nIf I offer Player 1 half of everything, my value would be half of 1416, which is 708. Discounted value is 708 * 0.98 = 693.84 which is much less than the outside offer value.\n\nI need to get at least 1360.2 now. Therefore, I want to keep as much of the items as possible for myself.\n\nI'll try offering only a small amount, say [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. This means I keep 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 7 units of item 4 and 2 units of item 5.\nMy value for that would be (1 * 94) + (1 * 68) + (3 * 87) + (7 * 90) + (2 * 8) = 94 + 68 + 261 + 630 + 16 = 1069\nDiscounted, it becomes 1069*0.98 = 1047.62. This is still lower than my outside offer of 1333.\n\nIt seems impossible to make an offer Player 1 would accept that would be worth more than my outside offer to me. Therefore, I should just walk away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

The offer is [1, 2, 1, 1, 2], meaning I get 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n\nValue of offer:\n(1 * 64) + (2 * 72) + (1 * 31) + (1 * 18) + (2 * 21) = 64 + 144 + 31 + 18 + 42 = 299\n\nMy outside offer is 668. Since 299 is significantly less than 668, I should not accept the current offer.\n\nI need to decide between walking away and making a counteroffer. Since this is round 1, there's room for negotiation. I will make a counteroffer that gives Player 1 roughly equal value to my outside offer, but let's first estimate what division would give me a value of about 668.\n\nTotal items: 2 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 4 of item 4, and 5 of item 5.\nTotal value if I keep all: (2 * 64) + (4 * 72) + (4 * 31) + (4 * 18) + (5 * 21) = 128 + 288 + 124 + 72 + 105 = 717\n\nI need to give away value of about 717-668 = 49.\nI will try a counteroffer that gives the following to Player 1: [1, 0, 0, 0, 0].\nThis implies I keep [1, 4, 4, 4, 5]. Value to me: (1 * 64) + (4 * 72) + (4 * 31) + (4 * 18) + (5 * 21) = 64 + 288 + 124 + 72 + 105 = 653.\nSince this is close to my outside offer, it may not be accepted.\n\nI will try to give player 1 something more valuable to me, but potentially less valuable to them.\nFor example, item 4 is less valuable to me. So, giving more of that away might be a good strategy.\nLet's try [1, 0, 0, 2, 0]: (1 * 64) + (0 * 72) + (0 * 31) + (2 * 18) + (0 * 21) = 64 + 36 = 100.\nRemaining value for me:\nKeep [1, 4, 4, 2, 5]. This equals: (1 * 64) + (4 * 72) + (4 * 31) + (2 * 18) + (5 * 21) = 64 + 288 + 124 + 36 + 105 = 617.

I would never do this.\n\nLet's try to target an amount so that my remaining value is around 668.\nI will give player 1 items to make up to value around 49 (717 - 668): [0, 0, 1, 1, 0] gives a value of 31 + 18 = 49.\nRemaining = [2, 4, 3, 3, 5]: (2*64) + (4*72) + (3*31) + (3*18) + (5*21) = 128 + 288 + 93 + 54 + 105 = 668\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

This means the value of any future offers will be multiplied by gamma for each additional round. If we reach round 3 (the last round), the effective value of any agreement in that round would be multiplied by \\(0.98^2\\).\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\nSince there is currently no offer on the table, we need to consider potential offers:\n\n- **My Total Value for Keeping All Items:**\n  - \\(2 \\times 54 + 5 \\times 85 + 4 \\times 29 + 7 \\times 3 + 6 \\times 67 = 1072\\)\n\n- **Comparing Possible Offers to My Outside Offer:**\n  - My task is to maximize my value while ensuring it's at least higher than my outside offer value of 443.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision Based on the Analysis\n\n- **Criteria for Proposing a Counteroffer:**\n  - I need to provide a fair division that allows me to retain more than 443 in value when considering the discount factor.\n  - Ideally, since Player 2 also has an outside offer, I would try to balance the totals to maximize my share.\n\n- **Creating a Counteroffer:**\n\n  Let's try a division that ensures my remaining value exceeds 443:\n\n  - Give Player 2: 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5.\n\nCalculating my retained value:\n- For item 1: \\(2 \\times 54 = 108\\)\n- For item 2: \\(5 \\times 85 = 425\\)\n- For item 3: \\(2 \\times 29 = 58\\)\n- For item 4: \\(1 \\times 3 = 3\\)\n- For item 5: \\(6 \\times 67 = 402\\)\n\nTotal retained value = \\(108 + 425 + 58 + 3 + 402 = 996\\)\n\nSince 996 is more than 443 (my outside offer), this is a rational counteroffer that provides significant value while keeping in mind the discount factor.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 2, 6, 0]}\n```",

Given the goal to maximize my value and avoid mistakes, I should ensure that I propose a division that gives me a value significantly higher than my outside offer and leaves room for negotiation.\n   - Ideal scenario: I retain high-value items for myself to ensure my total value does not go below my outside offer.\n   - To construct a reasonable offer, let's try to keep most of the high-value items and propose a smaller share of other items.

One potential offer might be:\n- Offer Player 2 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n\nThis means I keep:\n- 2 units of item 1 (value = 186)\n- 3 units of item 2 (value = 174)\n- 1 unit of item 3 (value = 18)\n- 3 units of item 4 (value = 63)\n- 2 units of item 5 (value = 82)\n\nTotal value to me: 186 + 174 + 18 + 63 + 82 = 523\n\nThis offer ensures I have a total value much greater than my outside offer, while allowing room for negotiation.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 2, 3, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 2, 3, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\nThe current offer gives me:\n* Item 1: 0 units\n* Item 2: 1 unit\n* Item 3: 2 units\n* Item 4: 3 units\n* Item 5: 1 unit\n\nMy values are:\n* Item 1: 33\n* Item 2: 15\n* Item 3: 70\n* Item 4: 72\n* Item 5: 61\n\nThe value of the current offer to me is:\n(0 * 33) + (1 * 15) + (2 * 70) + (3 * 72) + (1 * 61) = 0 + 15 + 140 + 216 + 61 = 432\n\nMy outside offer is 382.\n\nSince the current offer (432) is better than my outside offer (382), I should consider accepting. However, this is only round 1, so there's a possibility of getting a better deal by making a counteroffer.\n\nLet's calculate the total value of all items to me:\n(2 * 33) + (4 * 15) + (3 * 70) + (6 * 72) + (3 * 61) = 66 + 60 + 210 + 432 + 183 = 951\n\nIf I were to offer Player 1 nothing, I would get a value of 951. So, any offer that gives me more than 382 is potentially better than walking away *right now*, but I also have to consider the discount factor in later rounds.\n\nTo determine my counteroffer, I should consider that the other player is rational and trying to maximize their value given their own private values and outside offer. I don't know what those are, so the best I can do is make a \"reasonable\" counteroffer, hoping the other player doesn't walk.\n\nSince my total value is 951 and the current offer is worth 432 to me, I'm essentially giving the other player items worth (951 - 432) = 519 to me. This is potentially a pretty unbalanced offer, so Player 1 is likely to counter.\n\nMy goal should be to offer slightly less than half the total items to player 1 so that I can keep a majority of the items and hopefully Player 1 will accept.\n\nLet's make a counteroffer where I give Player 1 the following:\n* Item 1: 1 unit\n* Item 2: 2 units\n* Item 3: 1 unit\n* Item 4: 3 units\n* Item 5: 1 unit\n\nThis leaves me with:\n* Item 1: 1 unit\n* Item 2: 2 units\n* Item 3: 2 units\n* Item 4: 3 units\n* Item 5: 2 units\n\nThe value of my counteroffer is:\n(1 * 33) + (2 * 15) + (2 * 70) + (3 * 72) + (2 * 61) = 33 + 30 + 140 + 216 + 122 = 541\n\nOkay, 541 is much higher than my outside offer, so this counteroffer is good for me.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 1, 3, 1]}\n```",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 7. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 7. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 921 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

It incentivizes concluding the negotiation early as prolonged negotiation decreases the present value of any accepted offer.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n- **Current Offer**: There is no current offer from Player 2.\n- **Potential Counteroffers**: \n  - I need to propose an initial offer that ensures I gain more than my outside offer value of 7.\n  - Let's consider an example counteroffer where I attempt to maximize my retained value: \n  \n    My values for keeping:\n  - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273\n  - 4 units of item 2 = 4 \u00d7 58 = 232\n  - 5 units of item 3 = 5 \u00d7 29 = 145\n  - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 46 = 46\n  - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 83 = 166\n  - Total value = 862\n\n  In this proposal, I keep more than half of the total available units for most items and ensure the total value exceeds my outside offer value comfortably.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision:\n- **Accept the Current Offer**: Not applicable as there is no offer yet.\n- **Walk Away**: This is not advisable as I can secure a higher value than my outside offer through an offer.\n- **Propose Counteroffer**:\n\nGiven the analysis above, my next step is to make an initial proposal offering a reasonable amount to Player 2 that secures a high value of items for me while allowing room for negotiation.

Since 855 < 871, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider a counteroffer. I want to maximize my value, and I know Player 1's values are between 1 and 101. I have:\n- 3 units of item 1\n- 4 units of item 2\n- 10 units of item 3\n- 2 units of item 4\n- 7 units of item 5\n\nI need to decide what to offer Player 1. Since it's round 1, there's a good chance for further negotiation. I'll aim for something slightly better than my outside offer. A split down the middle, adjusted for my higher value items would be ideal, but lets aim to secure at least my outside option with my first counter offer.\n\nLet's try to give Player 1 as little as possible while still making it worthwhile for them to accept. I'll offer them less of what I value highly and more of the others. Let's say I offer Player 1 [1, 2, 5, 1, 3]\n\nThis means I keep:\n- Item 1: 3 - 1 = 2\n- Item 2: 4 - 2 = 2\n- Item 3: 10 - 5 = 5\n- Item 4: 2 - 1 = 1\n- Item 5: 7 - 3 = 4\n\nMy value for this split would be:\n- Item 1: 2 * 16 = 32\n- Item 2: 2 * 72 = 144\n- Item 3: 5 * 92 = 460\n- Item 4: 1 * 30 = 30\n- Item 5: 4 * 73 = 292\nTotal Value = 32 + 144 + 460 + 30 + 292 = 958\n\nSince 958 > 871, this counteroffer is better than walking away *if* it gets accepted.\nNow I must consider if Player 1 will accept my offer, and if not, is making another offer worth it in later rounds.\n\nBased on the fact that my offer nets me significantly more than my outside offer, and leaves Player 1 with reasonable amounts of each item, I will make the above counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 5, 1, 3]}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

A counteroffer that performs better might be possible in future scenarios, especially considering any offers from Player 2. Making sure to avoid mistakes, I could make a strategic but rarely forceful proposition due to my high outside offer value.\n\nGiven this and applying careful judgment with known and potential allocations, my action is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```\nThis action ensures maximizing my guaranteed offer while avoiding any suboptimal negotiation steps.",

Therefore, there's no need to evaluate an existing offer.\n\n   - **For potential counteroffers:** Consider dividing the items such that I ensure my value exceeds the outside offer of 417.

Since 1012 > 751, accepting the offer is better than walking away *at this stage*. However, we should consider if a counteroffer could yield an even better result, keeping in mind the discount factor in future rounds.\n\nLet's explore a slightly greedy counteroffer and see if we can improve. Given that this is the first round and we have a discount factor of 0.98, it might be beneficial to push for a better deal. Let's try offering Player 1 slightly less than the initial offer. A good start would be to give them back item 4, and reducing item 2\n\nCounteroffer: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] - Let's start by offering nothing\n\nValue calculation:\n\nMy values for these items are:\n- Item 1: 55\n- Item 2: 60\n- Item 3: 59\n- Item 4: 33\n- Item 5: 89\nI would receive:\n- Item 1: 8 - 0 = 8 units\n- Item 2: 5 - 0 = 5 units\n- Item 3: 3 - 0 = 3 units\n- Item 4: 4 - 0 = 4 units\n- Item 5: 1 - 0 = 1 unit\n\nSo, the total value of this offer to me is:\n(8 * 55) + (5 * 60) + (3 * 59) + (4 * 33) + (1 * 89) = 440 + 300 + 177 + 132 + 89 = 1138\n\nIf player 1 accepts, this is great. But if we go to the next round, 1138 *.98 = 1115. It still beats our current best offer.\n\nLet's try the counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

                    "response": "To determine the optimal action, let's go through the analysis step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **Outside Offer Value:** Your outside offer value is 439.\n- **Values of the Items Involved:**\n  - Item 1: 36 per unit\n  - Item 2: 22 per unit\n  - Item 3: 28 per unit\n  - Item 4: 7 per unit\n  - Item 5: 48 per unit\n\n- **Total Pool of Items:**\n  - 5 units of item 1\n  - 3 units of item 2\n  - 4 units of item 3\n  - 6 units of item 4\n  - 2 units of item 5\n\n- **Discount Factor:** The discount factor, gamma, is 0.98. If we reach round 3, the value of any deal will be multiplied by this factor.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer:** [2, 1, 2, 3, 1]\n  - Value of Item 1: 2 units \u00d7 36 = 72\n  - Value of Item 2: 1 unit \u00d7 22 = 22\n  - Value of Item 3: 2 units \u00d7 28 = 56\n  - Value of Item 4: 3 units \u00d7 7 = 21\n  - Value of Item 5: 1 unit \u00d7 48 = 48\n  - **Total Value:** 72 + 22 + 56 + 21 + 48 = 219\n\n- **Comparison to Outside Offer:**\n  - Current offer value (219) is less than the outside offer value (439).\n  - Thus, accepting the current offer would be worse than walking away, as it does not meet or exceed the value of the outside offer.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\n- **Should You Accept?** No, since the total value of the current offer (219) is lower than your outside offer (439).\n- **Should You Walk Away?** The current offer is not attractive compared to the outside offer.\n- **Should You Propose a Counteroffer?** Yes, propose a counteroffer that yields a higher value than your outside offer while being reasonable enough to potentially convince Player 2.\n\nLet's create a sensible counteroffer. Aim for a total value over 439, considering both total yield and fairness:\n\nFor example, propose keeping:\n- 4 units of item 1: 4 \u00d7 36 = 144\n- 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 22 = 44\n- 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 28 = 56\n- 4 units of item 4: 4 \u00d7 7 = 28\n- 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 48 = 48\n\nIn this scenario, you'd offer Player 2:\n- Giving 1 unit of item 1\n- Giving 1 unit of item 2\n- Giving 2 units of item 3\n- Giving 2 units of item 4\n- Giving 1 unit of item 5\n\nThis counteroffer yields a total value of 320, which does not meet your outside offer threshold of 439. Reconfigure the counteroffer to ensure a total higher than the outside offer. Let's offer 0 of items you value least and adjust others to balance higher value items:\n\nConfirm an offer meets your value without errors:\n4 units item 1, 3 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 3 of item 4, 1 of item 5:\n- 4 units of item 1: 4 \u00d7 36 = 144\n- 3 units of item 2: 3 \u00d7 22 = 66\n- 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 28 = 56\n- 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 7 = 21\n- 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 48 = 48\nTotal for you: 144 + 66 + 56 + 21 + 48 = 335\n\nRetain more to equate objectives \u2013 but change course:\nPropose all items kept while committing a mistake (limited steps). Calculate more staying, at least meeting or only just below 439.

                    "response": "Let's go through the step-by-step analysis:\n\n### Step 1: Current Situation Analysis\n\n- **Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer is valued at 439.\n- **Values of the Items**:\n  - Item 1: 36 per unit\n  - Item 2: 22 per unit\n  - Item 3: 28 per unit\n  - Item 4: 7 per unit\n  - Item 5: 48 per unit\n- **Total Pool of Items**:\n  - Item 1: 5 units\n  - Item 2: 3 units\n  - Item 3: 4 units\n  - Item 4: 6 units\n  - Item 5: 2 units\n- **Discount Factor**: Since it's round 3, the discount factor applies as \\( \\gamma^{r-1} = \\gamma^2 = 0.98^2 = 0.9604 \\).\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer from Player 2**: [2, 1, 1, 3, 1]\n  - Calculation of Value:\n    - 2 units of item 1: \\(2 \\times 36 = 72\\)\n    - 1 unit of item 2: \\(1 \\times 22 = 22\\)\n    - 1 unit of item 3: \\(1 \\times 28 = 28\\)\n    - 3 units of item 4: \\(3 \\times 7 = 21\\)\n    - 1 unit of item 5: \\(1 \\times 48 = 48\\)\n    - Total value = 72 + 22 + 28 + 21 + 48 = 191\n  - Value with discount factor = 191 * 0.9604 = 183.42\n\n- **Comparison with Outside Offer**:\n  - The current offer's value of 183.42 is much less than my outside offer of 439.\n\n### Step 3: Decision Making\n\n- **Should I accept the current offer?**\n  - No, because the value with the discount factor (183.42) is far less than my outside offer (439).\n  \n- **Should I walk away and take my outside offer?**\n  - Given the current offer's lower value, walking away ensures I receive a value of 439, which is significantly higher.\n\n- **Propose a specific counteroffer?**\n  - It's round 3, so I must weigh if a counteroffer could result in a better value than walking away. A counteroffer can be risky unless I am confident it will be accepted in subsequent rounds. Since this is the final round, proposing a counteroffer at this stage would not provide any opportunity for negotiation, and there's no guarantee Player 2 would accept a new offer.\n\nTherefore, given the negotiation circumstances and the need to avoid mistakes such as accepting a poor offer or proposing a weaker counteroffer, the logical decision is to walk away and secure the outside offer, which is more favorable than the current table offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 986. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 986. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 891 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 986. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 891 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 0, 1, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 3, 0, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 3, 0, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

Since 440 < 857, accepting the offer would be worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. I have:\n- 5 units of item 1\n- 1 unit of item 2\n- 2 units of item 3\n- 8 units of item 4\n- 3 units of item 5\n\nI need to decide how many units of each item to offer Player 1 to maximize my potential gain, taking into account the discount factor in later rounds. Since this is round 1, the discount factor doesn't affect the current round's calculations.\n\nI want to make a counteroffer that Player 1 is likely to accept, while also significantly improving my outcome compared to walking away. Since I don't know Player 1's values, I will make a reasonable counteroffer and hope it's good enough.\n\nLet's consider offering Player 1 half of everything, rounding up. That would be:\n- Item 1: 3\n- Item 2: 1\n- Item 3: 1\n- Item 4: 4\n- Item 5: 2\nThis leaves me with:\n- Item 1: 2\n- Item 2: 0\n- Item 3: 1\n- Item 4: 4\n- Item 5: 1\n\nThe value of this to me is:\n(2 * 53) + (0 * 43) + (1 * 33) + (4 * 54) + (1 * 75) = 106 + 0 + 33 + 216 + 75 = 430\n\nThis is still significantly less than my outside offer. However, if I offer player 1 a worse deal than their initial offer, they'll likely reject.\n\nLet's try offering player 1 something slightly better than what they offered me. If their values are similar to mine, it should be a good deal for them.\nPlayer 1 initially received [2,1,1,2,2]. Let's instead offer them [2,0,0,2,1]. That would leave me with [3,1,2,6,2].\nMy value would be (3*53)+(1*43)+(2*33)+(6*54)+(2*75) = 159+43+66+324+150=742. Still less than my outside option.\n\nLet's offer something that gives me significantly more, and hope player 1 is willing to negotiate. Let's try offering Player 1 one unit of each item: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1].\n\nThis leaves me with:\n- Item 1: 4\n- Item 2: 0\n- Item 3: 1\n- Item 4: 7\n- Item 5: 2\n\nMy value is:\n(4 * 53) + (0 * 43) + (1 * 33) + (7 * 54) + (2 * 75) = 212 + 0 + 33 + 378 + 150 = 773. Still below the outside offer, but closer.\n\nSince it is the first round, let's just stick to the outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",
