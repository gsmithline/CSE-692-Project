Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 79. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 79. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 273 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 1, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    1 x 0 + 5 x 3 + 52 x 1 + 11 x 1 + 22 x 0\n    which is 78 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 79. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

                    "response": "Step\u2010by\u2010step reasoning:\n1. First we compute the value (to us) of the current proposal. The current offer gives us:\n\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 2 units * 51 = 102  \n\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 6 units * 47 = 282  \n\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 1 unit * 86 = 86  \n\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 1 unit * 7 = 7  \n\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 1 unit * 3 = 3  \n\u2003Total = 102 + 282 + 86 + 7 + 3 = 480.\nSince we receive a discount factor of \u03b3^(r\u20131) = 1 in round 1, this deal is worth 480 to us.\n\n2. Our outside offer is 837, which is considerably higher than 480. Thus accepting the current offer would be worse than taking our guaranteed outside offer.\n\n3. In a counteroffer we can propose any valid division. In our formulation a counteroffer is given as a list [n1, n2, n3, n4, n5] which denotes the number of units of each item given to Player 1; we would receive what remains (Total \u2013 offered).\n\n4. Our total available items and our values per unit are:\n\u2003\u2013 Item 1: 3 units at 51 each  \n\u2003\u2013 Item 2: 9 units at 47 each  \n\u2003\u2013 Item 3: 5 units at 86 each  \n\u2003\u2013 Item 4: 2 units at 7 each  \n\u2003\u2013 Item 5: 3 units at 3 each  \ngiving a full total value of 1029.\n\n5. To get a deal that we prefer over our outside offer, our share must be worth at least 837. We could try to \u201cextract\u201d as much as possible by keeping the high\u2010value items for us. For our valuation the order of \u201cdesirability\u201d is: item 3 (86), item 1 (51), and then item 2 (47). The items that have low (or low incremental) value for us are item 4 (7) and item 5 (3), so we are willing to offer those entirely to the other side, hoping to \u201cbuy\u201d acceptance.\n\n6. The total maximum of our value is 1029, so if we take everything we net 1029. But we know we must give Player 1 something such that they find the deal at least as attractive as their own outside offer. Without knowing Player 1\u2019s private valuations, a prudent strategy is to \u201cconcede\u201d mostly in the items we value little. If we were to give them all of item 4 (2 units) and all of item 5 (3 units), that is a \u201closs\u201d from our perspective of 2\u00d77 + 3\u00d73 = 14 + 9 = 23 in our total surplus. We then need to give up an additional roughly (1029 \u2013 837 = 192) \u2013 23 = 169 worth of value from the items that matter more. With item 2 worth 47 per unit, this amounts to about 169/47 \u2248 3.6 units. Rounding to the nearest integer, giving them 3 units of item 2 (which \u201ccosts\u201d us 3\u00d747 = 141) would leave us with a total of 1029 \u2013 (23 + 141) = 1029 \u2013 164 = 865 value. This is above our outside option and not excessively greedy.\n\n7. In our counteroffer we thus propose to give Player 1:\n\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 0 units (we keep all 3, since they are high\u2010value to us)\n\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 3 units (so we keep 9 \u2013 3 = 6 units)\n\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 0 units (we keep all 5)\n\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 2 units (all of item 4)\n\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 3 units (all of item 5)\nOur resulting allocation gives us:\n\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 3 units \u2192 3\u00d751 = 153\n\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 6 units \u2192 6\u00d747 = 282\n\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 5 units \u2192 5\u00d786 = 430\nAdding up: 153 + 282 + 430 = 865.\nThis is above our 837 outside offer but does not \u201coverreach\u201d so much that Player 1 might balk, since they receive some items\u2014and notably all the low\u2010value items for us.\n\n8. Since 865 > 837, we obtain a slight improvement over our fallback. Although we cannot know Player 1\u2019s private values, this offer is constructed in a way to retain our most valuable items while conceding in areas we care less about. This should serve as a credible counteroffer.\n\nBased on this reasoning, our action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 0, 2, 3]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 147. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 924 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 1, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    65 x 0 + 47 x 1 + 99 x 1 + 52 x 0 + 45 x 0\n    which is 146 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 147. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

In thinking about counteroffers I must recall that whenever I propose a division I effectively \u201cchoose\u201d what I give to Player 1 \u2013 my share then is whatever remains. Since I must have at least 750 of 808 in my own valuation, I could only \u201cconcede\u201d at most 58 in my value. Yet the numbers dictate that if I try to give Player 1 even a minimal number of units (even from my cheapest\u2010valued items, item 2 at 20 per unit), the number of units given would be far too few to be attractive to them. (In expectation, Player 1\u2019s private values are around 51 per unit, and a rational counterpart would compare any offer\u2019s expected value to their own outside option, which\u2014given their total value over items\u2014is likely much higher than a handful of units.) In other words, any division that gives me at least 750 utility leaves Player 1 with only a very small fraction of the total \u201ccake\u201d (roughly 7% of the full 808 in my view) while Player 1\u2019s outside offer is drawn from a range that typically implies a much higher value. \n\nThus, although I could propose a counteroffer, any allocation that gives me at least 750 in my value would give Player 1 a bundle likely far worse in expectation than their own outside offer. Given this incompatibility\u2014I'm \"priced in\" to get almost all of the items by my private values while Player 1 would not accept such a small amount\u2014it is optimal for me not to negotiate further.\n\nTherefore, my action is to WALK away. \n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Evidently, the current offer is far below what you\u2019d guarantee yourself by walking away.\n\nStep 2: Consider a counteroffer.\nSince you won\u2019t accept an offer that gives you less than your outside offer (670) and you\u2019d prefer to improve on that if possible, you must propose a division that nets you at least 670 in your private value.\nOne natural idea is to \u201ctake\u201d your strongest items. Your highest\u2010value items are item 1 and item 4 (both valued at 77 per unit). There are 3 units of item 1 and 6 units of item 4. Taking them all yields:\n\u20033\u00d777 + 6\u00d777 = 231 + 462 = 693,\nwhich is above your outside offer.\nWith that in mind, you can offer Player\u00a01 the remaining items:\n\u2003\u2013 For item 1, offer 0 (so you keep all 3)  \n\u2003\u2013 For item 2, offer all 2 units  \n\u2003\u2013 For item 3, offer its single unit  \n\u2003\u2013 For item 4, offer 0 (keep all 6)  \n\u2003\u2013 For item 5, offer all 5 units  \nThus your counteroffer is to give Player\u00a01 the allocation:\n\u2003[0, 2, 1, 0, 5].\nIn return, you get the complementary bundle:\n\u2003Item 1: 3 units, Item 2: 0, Item 3: 0, Item 4: 6, Item 5: 0,\nyielding your value of 693.\n\nStep 3: Balancing incentives.\nNote that by \u201cclaiming\u201d all of your high\u2010value items you secure more than your reservation value (693 > 670). From Player\u00a01\u2019s perspective (with unknown private values) obtaining items 2, 3, and 5 might be less valuable on average. However, given this is round\u00a01 (no discount yet) and if they are cautious about the discounting in later rounds, they may be inclined to accept a deal that, while not optimal from their uncertain perspective, avoids delay.\nAs Player\u00a02 you must improve on the 358 you\u2019d get from accepting and, at worst, if it fails you\u2019ll have the outside offer worth 670. So with 693 in hand, there is an incentive for you to propose this counteroffer even if Player\u00a01 might demand a little more.\nThere is little \u201cwiggle room\u201d because any attempt to add even one unit from one of your prized items (item 1 or item 4) would cost you 77 points\u2014dropping your payoff way below 670.\n\nStep 4: Decision.\nBecause the current offer is far below your reservation (358 < 670) and your best counteroffer yields you 693 (while offering Player\u00a01 the remainder), your best action in round\u00a01 is to counteroffer with the division:\n\u2003Offer to Player\u00a01: [0, 2, 1, 0, 5].\n\nThus, my action is as follows:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 1, 0, 5]}",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 0, 0, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    38 x 3 + 49 x 0 + 48 x 0 + 86 x 0 + 36 x 2\n    which is 186 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 187. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 4, 3, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    52 x 3 + 74 x 4 + 52 x 3 + 93 x 2 + 71 x 2\n    which is 936 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 940. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "I need to develop a strong initial offer that maximizes my value while being strategic about what I offer to the other player. Let me analyze this carefully.\n\n## 1. Analyzing the situation\n\nMy outside offer value: 940\nMy item values: \n- Item 1: 52 per unit (3 units total)\n- Item 2: 74 per unit (4 units total)\n- Item 3: 52 per unit (3 units total)\n- Item 4: 93 per unit (2 units total)\n- Item 5: 71 per unit (3 units total)\n\nTotal pool of items: [3, 4, 3, 2, 3]\n\nTotal maximum value: 52\u00d73 + 74\u00d74 + 52\u00d73 + 93\u00d72 + 71\u00d73 = 156 + 296 + 156 + 186 + 213 = 1007\n\nThe discount factor (0.98) means any offer I make now is worth more than waiting for future rounds.\n\n## 2. Calculating value efficiency per item\n\nTo make a strategic offer, I should calculate the value per unit for each item:\n- Item 1: 52 value per unit\n- Item 2: 74 value per unit\n- Item 3: 52 value per unit\n- Item 4: 93 value per unit (highest value per unit)\n- Item 5: 71 value per unit\n\nSince I want to keep my highest value items, I should prioritize keeping Item 4, then Item 2, then Item 5, and be more willing to give up Items 1 and 3.\n\n## 3. Designing my first offer\n\nLet me try giving up small amounts of my lower-valued items while keeping high-value ones:\n\nIf I offer: [1, 1, 1, 0, 1] - meaning I keep [2, 3, 2, 2, 2]\nMy value would be: 52\u00d72 + 74\u00d73 + 52\u00d72 + 93\u00d72 + 71\u00d72 = 104 + 222 + 104 + 186 + 142 = 758\n\nThis is too low compared to my outside offer of 940.\n\nLet me try being more aggressive:\nIf I offer: [0, 0, 1, 0, 0] - meaning I keep [3, 4, 2, 2, 3]\nMy value would be: 52\u00d73 + 74\u00d74 + 52\u00d72 + 93\u00d72 + 71\u00d73 = 156 + 296 + 104 + 186 + 213 = 955\n\nThis exceeds my outside offer, so it's acceptable.\n\nLet me try a slightly different offer to see if I can improve:\nIf I offer: [1, 0, 1, 0, 0] - meaning I keep [2, 4, 2, 2, 3]\nMy value would be: 52\u00d72 + 74\u00d74 + 52\u00d72 + 93\u00d72 + 71\u00d73 = 104 + 296 + 104 + 186 + 213 = 903\n\nThis is below my outside offer of 940, so I'll discard it.\n\n## 4. Final decision\n\nI'll make the offer [0, 0, 1, 0, 0], which means:\n- I keep all 3 units of Item 1\n- I keep all 4 units of Item 2\n- I offer 1 unit of Item 3 (keeping 2)\n- I keep all 2 units of Item 4\n- I keep all 3 units of Item 5\n\nThis gives me a value of 955, which is above my outside offer of 940.\n\nThis is round 1, so I'm starting with a strong offer that significantly favors me. I'm only giving up 1 unit of my lowest-value item, which leaves room for negotiation in future rounds if needed.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]}",

My outside offer is 62, so the current proposal (98) is clearly better than walking away.\n3. Although I might try to ask for more of the items that I value (especially item\u202f2 or extra of item\u202f3), doing so would risk prolonging the negotiation. With a discount factor of 0.98 per round, any delay will lower the present value of my eventual outcome.\n4. In round\u202f1 the discounting is minimal (discount factor 1) and I already secure a good utility (98). Trading some of that value in hopes of a slightly better division might not be worth the risk given the unknowns regarding Player\u202f1\u2019s private item values.\n5.

The current offer from Player\u00a01 gives me [1, 1, 0, 2, 1] which for me totals:\n\u2003\u2003item1: 1\u00d749 = 49  \n\u2003\u2003item2: 1\u00d760 = 60  \n\u2003\u2003item3: 0\u00d79  = 0  \n\u2003\u2003item4: 2\u00d782 = 164  \n\u2003\u2003item5: 1\u00d778 = 78  \n\u2003\u2003Total \u2248 351.\nThis is far below my outside offer of 623.\n\n3. As Player\u00a02 my \u201creservation value\u201d is 623. To do any better than walking I would need to craft a counteroffer that gives me (when I receive the remaining items) a deal worth worth more than 623 (when discounting is not yet an issue in round 1) and (ideally) gives Player\u00a01 a bundle that is at least as good as his own outside option. I considered many variants.\n\n4. In a counteroffer I would specify what items I \u201cgive\u201d to Player\u00a01, with the understanding that what remains go to me. Because my total value is 819, if my \u201cown share\u201d is V, then I\u2019ve conceded (819\u2013V) in my own\u2010value \u201ccost.\u201d To guarantee V \u2265 623 I can only \u201cspend\u201d at most 196 points (in my own evaluation).\n\n5. I then explored a \u201cconcession trade\u2013off\u201d: I can cheaply give up items that I value little (like item 3 at 9 per unit) so that I lose little personally but may be giving something that Player\u00a01 (with unknown but roughly uniform values on [1,101]) could find attractive. However, even if I \u201cbuy\u201d as many units as possible with 196 points (for example, giving all 3 units of item 3 which costs me 27 points, and then using most of the remaining \u201cbudget\u201d on the cheapest items \u2013 e.g. item 1 at 49 each), the maximum number of extra units I can concede comes to only about 6 total units. From the perspective of an opponent who, on average, might value each unit around 51 points, this bundle would \u201clook like\u201d roughly 6\u00d751 \u2248 306 points. That is much lower than the likely outside offer value for Player\u00a01 (which, given his random draw from [1, his full\u2011value ~about 765], is expected to be around 380 points or more).\n\n6. In effect, if I try to secure a deal for myself worth even a bit above 623 (my outside option) then I cannot afford to \u201cpay\u201d Player\u00a01 enough \u201cunits\u201d (even optimally chosen ones) to have his share come close to what his disagreement (outside) value might be. In other words, any division that nets me more than 623 almost inevitably leaves Player\u00a01 with an unattractive bundle relative to what he might get by walking away. (The current offer \u2013 giving him a handful of items \u2013 leaves him far less than his likely outside offer.)\n\n7. Faced with a current offer that gives me only 351 and with no counteroffer seeming likely to produce a mutually acceptable deal (one giving me above 623 while also giving Player\u00a01 a share competitive with his outside offer), my best guarantee is what I already have: an outside offer of 623.\n\nTherefore, my rational move is not to accept the low offer and not to risk a counteroffer that will eventually fall through (since if no deal is reached we both get our outside offers). Given I can guarantee myself 623 by walking away, I choose to WALK.\n\nMy action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 921. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 921. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 546 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [7, 2, 2, 11, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    13 x 7 + 76 x 2 + 10 x 2 + 40 x 11 + 43 x 5\n    which is 918 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 921. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "I need to analyze this negotiation carefully to maximize my value while avoiding mistakes.\n\n## Step 1: Analyze the current situation\n\n- My outside offer value: 921\n- My private values per item:\n  - Item 1: 13 per unit (7 units total)\n  - Item 2: 76 per unit (2 units total)\n  - Item 3: 10 per unit (5 units total)\n  - Item 4: 40 per unit (11 units total)\n  - Item 5: 43 per unit (5 units total)\n- Total pool of items: [7, 2, 5, 11, 5]\n- Discount factor: 0.98 (reducing value in later rounds)\n\nTotal possible value for me if I kept everything:\n7\u00d713 + 2\u00d776 + 5\u00d710 + 11\u00d740 + 5\u00d743 = 91 + 152 + 50 + 440 + 215 = 948\n\n## Step 2: Calculate potential offers\n\nSince my outside offer is 921, I need to ensure I keep enough value for myself. Any offer I make should leave me with at least 921 value.\n\nIf I want to make a strong initial offer, I should try to keep most of the high-value items (especially item 2) while being willing to give up more of the lower-value items (like item 3).\n\nLet me try an initial offer where I give:\n- 2 units of item 1 (keeping 5)\n- 0 units of item 2 (keeping all 2)\n- 4 units of item 3 (keeping 1)\n- 3 units of item 4 (keeping 8)\n- 1 unit of item 5 (keeping 4)\n\nValue I keep: 5\u00d713 + 2\u00d776 + 1\u00d710 + 8\u00d740 + 4\u00d743 = 65 + 152 + 10 + 320 + 172 = 719\n\nThat's too low compared to my outside offer. Let me adjust:\n\nLet me try keeping more of item 4 which has good total value:\n- 2 units of item 1 (giving 5)\n- 0 units of item 2 (giving 0)\n- 4 units of item 3 (giving 1)\n- 1 unit of item 4 (giving 10)\n- 1 unit of item 5 (giving 4)\n\nValue I keep: 5\u00d713 + 2\u00d776 + 1\u00d710 + 10\u00d740 + 4\u00d743 = 65 + 152 + 10 + 400 + 172 = 799\n\nStill too low. Let me try again:\n\nLet me try:\n- 2 units of item 1 (giving 5)\n- 0 units of item 2 (giving 0)\n- 3 units of item 3 (giving 2)\n- 0 units of item 4 (giving 0)\n- 0 units of item 5 (giving 0)\n\nValue I keep: 5\u00d713 + 2\u00d776 + 3\u00d710 + 11\u00d740 + 5\u00d743 = 65 + 152 + 30 + 440 + 215 = 902\n\nStill below my outside offer. Let me try one more approach:\n\nLet's try:\n- 1 unit of item 1 (giving 6)\n- 0 units of item 2 (giving 0)\n- 2 units of item 3 (giving 3)\n- 0 units of item 4 (giving 0)\n- 0 units of item 5 (giving 0)\n\nValue I keep: 6\u00d713 + 2\u00d776 + 3\u00d710 + 11\u00d740 + 5\u00d743 = 78 + 152 + 30 + 440 + 215 = 915\n\nStill not enough. Let me try a minimal offer:\n\nLet's try:\n- 0 units of item 1 (giving 0)\n- 0 units of item 2 (giving 0)\n- 2 units of item 3 (giving 3)\n- 0 units of item 4 (giving 0)\n- 0 units of item 5 (giving 0)\n\nValue I keep: 7\u00d713 + 2\u00d776 + 2\u00d710 + 11\u00d740 + 5\u00d743 = 91 + 152 + 20 + 440 + 215 = 918\n\nStill below my outside offer. Actually, I need to rethink my strategy. Since my outside offer (921) is so close to the total value of all items (948), I need to be very strategic.\n\nLet me try just giving a tiny amount:\n- 0 units of item 1 (giving 0)\n- 0 units of item 2 (giving 0)\n- 0 units of item 3 (giving 0)\n- 0 units of item 4 (giving 0)\n- 0 units of item 5 (giving 0)\n\nBut that would be Mistake 3 (offering nothing). I need to offer something.\n\nLet me try:\n- 0 units of item 1 (giving 0)\n- 0 units of item 2 (giving 0)\n- 3 units of item 3 (giving 3)\n- 0 units of item 4 (giving 0)\n- 0 units of item 5 (giving 0)\n\nValue I keep: 7\u00d713 + 2\u00d776 + 2\u00d710 + 11\u00d740 + 5\u00d743 = 91 + 152 + 20 + 440 + 215 = 918\n\nThat's still below my outside offer. Let me try giving up one unit of the lowest value item:\n\n- 0 units of item 1 (giving 0)\n- 0 units of item 2 (giving 0)\n- 3 units of item 3 (giving 3)\n- 0 units of item 4 (giving 0)\n- 0 units of item 5 (giving 0)\n\nValue I keep: 7\u00d713 + 2\u00d776 + 2\u00d710 + 11\u00d740 + 5\u00d743 = 91 + 152 + 20 + 440 + 215 = 918\n\nMy situation is challenging because my outside offer is so close to the total value. I need to make a strategic decision.\n\n## Step 3: Make a decision\n\nGiven that:\n1. My outside offer is 921\n2. The total value of all items is 948\n3. Almost any meaningful offer will leave me with less than my outside offer\n\nI should consider walking away, but I'll try making a minimal offer since this is only round 1. I'll give Player 2 just item 3, which is my lowest valued item:\n\n- 0 units of item 1 (giving 0)\n- 0 units of item 2 (giving 0)\n- 5 units of item 3 (giving all of item 3)\n- 0 units of item 4 (giving 0)\n- 0 units of item 5 (giving 0)\n\nValue I keep: 7\u00d713 + 2\u00d776 + 0\u00d710 + 11\u00d740 + 5\u00d743 = 91 + 152 + 0 + 440 + 215 = 898\n\nThis is still below my outside offer, but it's the closest I can get while making a meaningful offer. Given the discount factor, if we reach an agreement in round 1, there's no discount, but waiting costs me value. This is my best strategic move to start the negotiation.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 5, 0, 0]}",

For example, consider giving you:\n\u2003\u2022 4 units of item\u00a01 (out of 7)\n\u2003\u2022 1 unit of item\u00a02 (out of 2)\n\u2003\u2022 2 units of item\u00a03 (out of 5)\n\u2003\u2022 3 units of item\u00a04 (out of 11)\n\u2003\u2022 2 units of item\u00a05 (out of 5)\nThen your allocation would be [4, 1, 2, 3, 2] and I would get the remainder:\n\u2003\u2022 Item1: 7\u20134 = 3,\n\u2003\u2022 Item2: 2\u20131 = 1,\n\u2003\u2022 Item3: 5\u20132 = 3,\n\u2003\u2022 Item4: 11\u20133 = 8,\n\u2003\u2022 Item5: 5\u20132 = 3.\nMy total value would then be:\n\u2003Item1: 3\u00d734 = 102,\n\u2003Item2: 1\u00d728 = 28,\n\u2003Item3: 3\u00d750 = 150,\n\u2003Item4: 8\u00d790 = 720,\n\u2003Item5: 3\u00d743 = 129,\nfor a total of 102 + 28 + 150 + 720 + 129 = 1129.\nThis is well above my outside offer (726), and while it gives you some allocation it leaves me with the bulk of item\u00a04 which is particularly valuable to me.\n\nGiven that the current offer is very unfavorable (only 250 in my eyes), and my counteroffer secures me a high value (1129) while offering you a share that might be acceptable, my action in round 1 will be to COUNTEROFFER this division.\n\nThus, my response will be:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 1, 2, 3, 2]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 921. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 546 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [7, 2, 2, 11, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    13 x 7 + 76 x 2 + 10 x 2 + 40 x 11 + 43 x 5\n    which is 918 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 921. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 5, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [4, 1, 2, 3, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [4, 1, 2, 3, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

They seem to want more of items 1, 3, and potentially 5. \n\nIf I offer them:\n[1, 0, 5, 1, 1] - meaning I keep [6, 2, 0, 10, 4]\n\nMy value would be:\n- 6 units of item 1: 6 \u00d7 13 = 78\n- 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 76 = 152\n- 0 units of item 3: 0 \u00d7 10 = 0\n- 10 units of item 4: 10 \u00d7 40 = 400\n- 4 units of item 5: 4 \u00d7 43 = 172\n\nTotal value to me: 802\n\nWith discount factor (0.98): 802 \u00d7 0.98 = 785.96\n\nThis is still lower than my outside offer. I need to keep more high-value items.\n\nLet's try another offer:\n[0, 0, 5, 3, 0] - meaning I keep [7, 2, 0, 8, 5]\n\nMy value would be:\n- 7 units of item 1: 7 \u00d7 13 = 91\n- 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 76 = 152\n- 0 units of item 3: 0 \u00d7 10 = 0\n- 8 units of item 4: 8 \u00d7 40 = 320\n- 5 units of item 5: 5 \u00d7 43 = 215\n\nTotal value to me: 778\n\nWith discount factor (0.98): 778 \u00d7 0.98 = 762.44\n\nStill below my outside offer.\n\nOne more approach - I'll try to give away items I value less:\n[1, 0, 5, 2, 0] - meaning I keep [6, 2, 0, 9, 5]\n\nMy value would be:\n- 6 units of item 1: 6 \u00d7 13 = 78\n- 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 76 = 152\n- 0 units of item 3: 0 \u00d7 10 = 0\n- 9 units of item 4: 9 \u00d7 40 = 360\n- 5 units of item 5: 5 \u00d7 43 = 215\n\nTotal value to me: 805\n\nWith discount factor (0.98): 805 \u00d7 0.98 = 788.9\n\nThis is still below my outside offer of 921.\n\nGiven that I can't create a reasonable counteroffer that exceeds my outside offer value (even without considering the discount factor), and the current offer is significantly below my outside offer, walking away is my best option.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

However, given the uncertainty about Player 1\u2019s private values and outside offer, and the risk that further negotiation (and possible counteroffers) might lead to discounting or even a failed deal, any counteroffer I propose must be significantly more favorable than the current offer to be worth the risk.\n\u2022 Given that my fallback (703) exceeds what I would get today from the current offer or a marginally improved counteroffer that might not be accepted, I have a strong incentive not to settle for a deal below my secure outside option.\n\nStep 4 \u2013 Decision:\n\u2022 Since the current offer (262) is much lower than my safe alternative of 703, and because entering into counteroffer negotiations risks ending up with a discounted (or failed) deal, my best risk\u2010avoiding move is to WALK away.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 5, 0, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    57 x 2 + 71 x 5 + 4 x 0 + 68 x 1 + 27 x 3\n    which is 618 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 619. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

That means your eventual allocation will be whatever remains.\n\u2022\u2003The items available are:\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: total 7 units,\n\u2003\u2003Item 2: total 2,\n\u2003\u2003Item 3: total 3,\n\u2003\u2003Item 4: total 3,\n\u2003\u2003Item 5: total 4.\n\u2022\u2003Your private per\u2010unit values are:\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 14,\u2003Item 2: 73,\u2003Item 3: 86,\u2003Item 4: 96,\u2003Item 5: 5.\n\u2022\u2003If you offer Player 1 an amount \u201cx\u201d (a vector [x1, x2, x3, x4, x5]), your final allocation becomes:\n\u2003\u2003Item i: (total[i] \u2013 x[i]).\n\u2022\u2003Thus your total value is:\n\u2003\u2003810 \u2013 (14\u00b7x1 + 73\u00b7x2 + 86\u00b7x3 + 96\u00b7x4 + 5\u00b7x5)\n\u2003\u2003(since the total undiscounted value of all items is 810).\n\nStep 3: Guaranteeing Your Reservation Value\n\u2022\u2003You want your value to be at least your outside offer of 632. Therefore you need:\n\u2003\u2003810 \u2013 (14\u00b7x1 + 73\u00b7x2 + 86\u00b7x3 + 96\u00b7x4 + 5\u00b7x5) \u2265 632,\n\u2003\u2003which implies 14\u00b7x1 + 73\u00b7x2 + 86\u00b7x3 + 96\u00b7x4 + 5\u00b7x5 \u2264 810 \u2013 632 = 178.\n\u2022\u2003At the same time you would like to give Player 1 a \u201cgenerous\u201d enough share so they are likely to accept instead of playing on (and because you\u2019re in round 1, you want to avoid needless delay and discounting later).\n\nStep 4: Constructing a Specific Counteroffer\n\u2022\u2003Items on which you have less to lose are those you value less. In your case, Item 1 (14 per unit) and Item 5 (5 per unit) are \u201ccheap\u201d for you.\n\u2022\u2003A natural idea is to offer Player 1 the full amounts of item 1 and item 5, if possible:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Set x1 = 7 (all of Item 1) and x5 = 4 (all of Item 5).\n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003The cost to you: 7\u00d714 + 4\u00d75 = 98 + 20 = 118.\n\u2022\u2003\u2022\u2003This leaves room (178 \u2013 118 = 60) to \u201cbuy back\u201d some value from one of the remaining items to give Player 1 additional beneficial items without dropping your own total below 632.\n\u2022\u2003Notice that offering even 1 unit of Item 2 (worth 73 for you) would cost 73. That\u2019s too high if added to 118 (total becomes 191), which would mean your value would be 810 \u2013 191 = 619 (<632). However, you could \u201ctrade\u201d one unit of item 1 for one unit of item 2.\n\u2022\u2003That is, if you offer slightly less of Item 1 and add 1 unit of Item 2:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Set x1 = 6 instead of 7 (saving 14 cost points) and x2 = 1 (adding 73 cost points). \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 New cost from Items 1 and 2: 6\u00d714 + 1\u00d773 = 84 + 73 = 157.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Then add fully Item 5: x5 = 4 \u2192 cost = 4\u00d75 = 20.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Total \u201ccost\u201d = 157 + 20 = 177, which is \u2264 178.\n\u2022\u2003Your allocation in that case is:\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 7 \u2212 6 = 1,\n\u2003\u2003Item 2: 2 \u2212 1 = 1,\n\u2003\u2003Item 3: 3 \u2212 0 = 3,\n\u2003\u2003Item 4: 3 \u2212 0 = 3,\n\u2003\u2003Item 5: 4 \u2212 4 = 0.\n\u2022\u2003Your own total value then is:\n\u2003\u20031\u00d714 + 1\u00d773 + 3\u00d786 + 3\u00d796 + 0\u00d75 = 14 + 73 + 258 + 288 = 633,\n\u2003\u2003which is safely above your outside offer of 632.\n\u2022\u2003Player 1 would receive: [6, 1, 0, 0, 4]. Though you do not know their exact per\u2010unit values, this offer gives them all of item 1 and item 5, and 1 unit of item 2 (which might be attractive since these items may be relatively more valuable for them).\n\nStep 5: Conclude Your Action \n\u2022\u2003Since the current offer is far below your outside value and you can propose a counteroffer that guarantees you at least 632 (in this case, 633) while likely making it appealing for Player 1, your optimal action is to COUNTEROFFER.\n\nFinal Action Response in the required format is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [6, 1, 0, 0, 4]}",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 1, 3, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This suggests that Player 2 values items 3 and 4 highly, and possibly item 2 as well.\n\n## Step 4: Formulate a counteroffer\nLet me create a counteroffer that's better than my outside offer but potentially agreeable to Player 2:\n\nI'll keep:\n- 1 unit of item 1 (giving 6 to Player 2)\n- 2 units of item 2 (giving 0 to Player 2)\n- 1 unit of item 3 (giving 2 to Player 2)\n- 3 units of item 4 (giving 0 to Player 2)\n- 2 units of item 5 (giving 2 to Player 2)\n\nMy value would be:\n- 1 \u00d7 3 = 3\n- 2 \u00d7 46 = 92\n- 1 \u00d7 7 = 7\n- 3 \u00d7 23 = 69\n- 2 \u00d7 17 = 34\n\nTotal: 3 + 92 + 7 + 69 + 34 = 205\nWith discount: 205 \u00d7 0.98 = 200.9\n\nThis is significantly better than my outside offer (157) and better than the current offer on the table.\n\nThe counteroffer I'd make is [6, 0, 2, 0, 2] (what I give to Player 2).\n\n## Step 5: Final decision\nThis counteroffer gives me a value of approximately 200.9, which is better than my outside offer of 157. It also gives Player 2 the items they seem to value (based on their previous offer), particularly items 1 and 3, while I keep the items that are more valuable to me (items 2 and 4).\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [6, 0, 2, 0, 2]}",

                    "response": "Step\u2010by\u2010step reasoning:\n\n1. We note that our private values (per unit) are: item1 = 14, item2 = 73, item3 = 86, item4 = 96, item5 = 5, so that if we got all items we\u2019d obtain 7\u00d714 + 2\u00d773 + 3\u00d786 + 3\u00d796 + 4\u00d75 = 810. Our outside option is 632 (and it is not subject to discounting); in comparison an agreement reached in round 2 is worth the agreed\u2010upon \u201craw\u201d value multiplied by 0.98.\n\n2. The current offer from Player 1 is that we receive [6, 0, 2, 0, 2]. Calculating our value from this offer:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item1: 6\u00d714 = 84\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item2: 0\u00d773 = 0\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item3: 2\u00d786 = 172\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item4: 0\u00d796 = 0\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item5: 2\u00d75  = 10\n\u2003\u2003Total = 84 + 172 + 10 = 266.\n\u2003\u2003After applying the round-2 discount, 266 \u00d7 0.98 \u2248 260.7, which is far below 632. So accepting it is clearly poor for us.\n\n3. Being Player2 in round 2 we have the option to counteroffer. We want a final allocation (after discount) that exceeds 632. That means our \u201craw\u201d share must be at least 632/0.98 \u2248 645.\n\n4. Looking at our item values, we highly prize items 2 (73), 3 (86) and 4 (96). In fact, obtaining all of items2,3, and 4 would yield:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item2: 2\u00d773 = 146\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item3: 3\u00d786 = 258\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item4: 3\u00d796 = 288\n\u2003\u2003Summing to 146 + 258 + 288 = 692 \u2014 which exceeds our needed 645.\n\u2003\n5. A natural idea is to \u201cclaim\u201d all of our high\u2010value items (2, 3, and 4) and offer the rest (which we value low) to Player 1. The remaining items, item1 (7 units) and item5 (4 units), give us very little (7\u00d714 + 4\u00d75 = 98+20 = 118) and are less attractive to us. Although we do not know Player 1\u2019s private values exactly, given that Player 1\u2019s values are drawn uniformly from [1,101] the expected per\u2010unit value is roughly 51. Thus the bundle [7,0,0,0,4] is expected to be attractive to Player 1.\n\n6. In this counteroffer our allocation would be:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 We get: item1: 0, item2: 2, item3: 3, item4: 3, item5: 0 (raw value = 692, and discounted value \u2248692\u00d70.98 \u2248 678, which improves upon our outside option of 632).\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Player 1 gets: item1: 7, item2: 0, item3: 0, item4: 0, item5: 4.\n\u2003\n7. This counteroffer is valid and meets our personal threshold while giving an expected attractive package to Player 1. (Note that if Player 1 rejects this counteroffer the game will go to round 3 where our options are even more limited as a counteroffer by Player 2 would count as a WALK. So it is advantageous for us to propose a reasonable division now.)\n\nThus, our action is to counteroffer by offering Player 1 the bundle corresponding to [7, 0, 0, 0, 4] (which means we keep the remaining items for ourselves).\n\nOur response in the required JSON format is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [7, 0, 0, 0, 4]}",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 1, 3, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    3 x 0 + 46 x 1 + 7 x 1 + 23 x 3 + 17 x 2\n    which is 156 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 157. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 0, 2, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    77 x 0 + 67 x 3 + 18 x 0 + 67 x 2 + 11 x 1\n    which is 346 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 350. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Although I don\u2019t know their private values, items 1 and 2 are relatively \u201ccheap\u201d for me and likely attractive if Player 1\u2019s private values are on average higher.

Since Player 2 seems to prefer items 3, 4, and 5, I could offer them more of those while keeping most of the high-value items 1, 2, and 4 for myself.\n\nLet me try a counteroffer: [1, 1, 2, 0, 1]\nThis would leave me with: [3, 2, 0, 2, 0]\nValue to me: (3 \u00d7 77) + (2 \u00d7 67) + (0 \u00d7 18) + (2 \u00d7 67) + (0 \u00d7 11)\n         = 231 + 134 + 134\n         = 499\n\nThis value (499) is still significantly better than my outside offer (350), and gives Player 2 more of what they seem to value while preserving most of my value compared to the current offer (509). \n\nLet me consider one more option, offering [0, 1, 2, 0, 1]:\nThis would leave me with: [4, 2, 0, 2, 0]\nValue to me: (4 \u00d7 77) + (2 \u00d7 67) + (0 \u00d7 18) + (2 \u00d7 67) + (0 \u00d7 11)\n         = 308 + 134 + 134\n         = 576\n\nThis is better for me than both the current offer and my previous counteroffer consideration.\n\nSince this counteroffer gives me 576, which is better than the current offer of 509, I'll make this counteroffer to Player 2.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 2, 0, 1]}",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 0, 2, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    77 x 0 + 67 x 3 + 18 x 0 + 67 x 2 + 11 x 1\n    which is 346 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 350.

This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [6, 5, 4, 1, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    95 x 6 + 25 x 5 + 48 x 4 + 17 x 1 + 4 x 2\n    which is 912 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 914. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "I need to analyze this negotiation carefully to determine my best opening move.\n\n## Step 1: Analyzing the current situation\n\n- My outside offer value: 914\n- My item values: 95 for item 1, 25 for item 2, 48 for item 3, 17 for item 4, 4 for item 5\n- Total pool of items: 6 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 4 units of item 5\n- Total value of all items for me: (6\u00d795) + (5\u00d725) + (5\u00d748) + (1\u00d717) + (4\u00d74) = 570 + 125 + 240 + 17 + 16 = 968\n- Discount factor: 0.98 (which means each round reduces value by 2%)\n\n## Step 2: Assessing potential offers\n\nI need to make an initial offer that lets me keep most of the high-value items while offering enough to seem reasonable. Item 1 is by far my most valuable at 95 per unit, followed by item 3 at 48 per unit. Items 2, 4, and 5 are lower value for me.\n\nLet me calculate a potential opening offer where I give Player 2:\n- 0 units of item 1 (keeping all 6 for myself)\n- 3 units of item 2 (keeping 2 for myself)\n- 1 unit of item 3 (keeping 4 for myself)\n- 1 unit of item 4 (giving away the only unit)\n- 3 units of item 5 (keeping 1 for myself)\n\nValue of what I keep:\n- 6 units of item 1 = 6 \u00d7 95 = 570\n- 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 25 = 50\n- 4 units of item 3 = 4 \u00d7 48 = 192\n- 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 17 = 0\n- 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 4 = 4\n\nTotal value I keep: 570 + 50 + 192 + 0 + 4 = 816\n\nThis is actually less than my outside offer of 914, so this won't work. I need to keep more high-value items.\n\nLet me recalculate with a better offer:\n- 0 units of item 1 (keeping all 6 for myself)\n- 2 units of item 2 (keeping 3 for myself)\n- 0 units of item 3 (keeping all 5 for myself)\n- 1 unit of item 4 (giving away the only unit)\n- 3 units of item 5 (keeping 1 for myself)\n\nValue of what I keep:\n- 6 units of item 1 = 6 \u00d7 95 = 570\n- 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75\n- 5 units of item 3 = 5 \u00d7 48 = 240\n- 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 17 = 0\n- 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 4 = 4\n\nTotal value I keep: 570 + 75 + 240 + 0 + 4 = 889\n\nThis is still below my outside offer of 914. I need to keep even more value.\n\nLet's try a more aggressive offer:\n- 0 units of item 1 (keeping all 6 for myself)\n- 1 unit of item 2 (keeping 4 for myself)\n- 0 units of item 3 (keeping all 5 for myself)\n- 1 unit of item 4 (giving away the only unit)\n- 3 units of item 5 (keeping 1 for myself)\n\nValue of what I keep:\n- 6 units of item 1 = 6 \u00d7 95 = 570\n- 4 units of item 2 = 4 \u00d7 25 = 100\n- 5 units of item 3 = 5 \u00d7 48 = 240\n- 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 17 = 0\n- 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 4 = 4\n\nTotal value I keep: 570 + 100 + 240 + 0 + 4 = 914\n\nThis exactly matches my outside offer value! But I should try to do slightly better to account for the discount factor.\n\nLet's adjust one more time to get above my outside offer:\n- 0 units of item 1 (keeping all 6 for myself)\n- 1 unit of item 2 (keeping 4 for myself)\n- 0 units of item 3 (keeping all 5 for myself)\n- 0 units of item 4 (keeping the only unit)\n- 3 units of item 5 (keeping 1 for myself)\n\nValue of what I keep:\n- 6 units of item 1 = 6 \u00d7 95 = 570\n- 4 units of item 2 = 4 \u00d7 25 = 100\n- 5 units of item 3 = 5 \u00d7 48 = 240\n- 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 17 = 17\n- 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 4 = 4\n\nTotal value I keep: 570 + 100 + 240 + 17 + 4 = 931\n\nThis is better than my outside offer of 914.\n\n## Step 3: Making a decision\n\nThe offer I'm proposing gives Player 2:\n- 0 units of item 1\n- 1 unit of item 2\n- 0 units of item 3\n- 0 units of item 4\n- 3 units of item 5\n\nThis keeps my value at 931, which is above my outside offer of 914. This is a fairly aggressive opening offer, but it still gives something to Player 2 to start the negotiation. I'm keeping all of my highest-value items (items 1 and 3), but offering them some of the lower-value items.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 0, 3]}",

Trying to counteroffer introduces risk and might prolong negotiations, potentially resulting in a discounted outcome in later rounds if a deal is reached\u2014or worse, the negotiation might collapse.\n\nStep 4: Decision. The current offer not only exceeds your outside option by a healthy margin, but it is also early in the negotiation with no discount incurred. Although you might hope to 'grab' a slightly more favorable split by negotiating for a better division (for example, demanding more of your high\u2010valued item2), without knowing Player\u00a01\u2019s private values you risk the possibility that your counteroffer might be rejected, leading you to a discounted outcome later.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

                    "response": "Step\u2010by\u2010step reasoning:\n\n1. Our total value (if we got every unit) is 824, and our privately drawn outside offer guarantees us 709 if we walk away. This means that from our point of view any deal must yield us at least 709 (adjusted for discounting) in our own evaluation in order to be preferable.\n\n2. The current offer from Player 1 gives us the items [2, 1, 0, 1, 3]. When we calculate our value from that allocation using our unit values (85, 12, 55, 7, 63), we get:\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 2\u00d785 = 170\n\u2003\u2003Item 2: 1\u00d712 = 12\n\u2003\u2003Item 3: 0\u00d755 = 0\n\u2003\u2003Item 4: 1\u00d77 = 7\n\u2003\u2003Item 5: 3\u00d763 = 189\n\u2003\u2003Total = 170 + 12 + 0 + 7 + 189 = 378.\n\u2003This 378 is far below our outside offer of 709.\n\n3. In proposing a counteroffer we have two competing considerations. On one side, we want to \u201cclaim\u201d as many high\u2010value items as possible so that our share is at least 709. Since our maximum value is 824, this leaves us only a margin of 824 \u2013 709 = 115 (in our valuation) to concede. On the other side, if we concede very little to Player 1 then his share will be very low compared to what his own outside offer (drawn from his total value) might be. In effect, if we try to keep nearly everything for ourselves so our value is above 709, any counteroffer would likely offer Player 1 far less than his expected alternative; hence he would reject it and, by choosing to walk away, realize his own outside offer.\n\n4. Given that the current offer gives us only 378, and that a counteroffer aiming to secure at least 709 on our side would be extremely stingy from Player 1\u2019s perspective (and likely be rejected by him in favor of his outside option), our best course is to secure our guaranteed outside offer.\n\n5. Therefore, in round 1 our best action is to WALK away so that we secure our outside offer value of 709 rather than risk receiving a final deal that provides us with much less.\n\nHence, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1095. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 924 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 5, 1, 4, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    79 x 4 + 84 x 5 + 74 x 1 + 42 x 4 + 29 x 4\n    which is 1094 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1095. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

In effect you can \u201cgive up\u201d at most 1291 \u2013 1111 = 180 in value from the full pie.\n\nStep 3. Choose which items you prefer to keep. Notice that your per\u2010unit values vary:\n \u2022 Items 1, 2, and 3 are very valuable for you.\n \u2022 Item 4 is low (17 each) and item 5 is moderate (56 each).\nA good strategy is to concede mostly the lower\u2013valued items. For example, if you give Player 1 all 5 units of item 4, you lose 5\u00d717 = 85 of your potential value, leaving you with 1291 \u2013 85 = 1206. You can still concede a little more if needed. Giving up 1 unit of item 5 costs you 56. That brings your total concession to 85+56 = 141, leaving you with 1291 \u2013 141 = 1150, which is comfortably above your outside offer of 1111.\n\nStep 4. Formulate the counteroffer. Interpret the counteroffer format correctly: the list indicates how many units of each item you \u201cgive to\u201d Player 1. Thus, if you propose to give Player 1 no units of items 1\u20133, all 5 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5, then you keep:\n \u2022 Item 1: 6-0 = 6 units\n \u2022 Item 2: 5-0 = 5 units \n \u2022 Item 3: 1-0 = 1 unit \n \u2022 Item 4: 5-5 = 0 units\n \u2022 Item 5: 4-1 = 3 units\nYour value from this resulting allocation is:\n\u2003\u20036\u00d772 + 5\u00d793 + 1\u00d785 + 0\u00d717 + 3\u00d756 = 432 + 465 + 85 + 0 + 168 = 1150\n\nThis outcome is better than your outside option. It also minimizes the \u201cconcession cost\u201d on items you value highly.\n\nStep 5. Conclude your action.\nYou want to counter rather than accept the poor offer (202) or walk away (which would net you 1111). Your counteroffer is:\n\u2003\u2003[0, 0, 0, 5, 1]\n\nThus, the response in the required format is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 5, 1]}",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 5, 1, 4, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    79 x 4 + 84 x 5 + 74 x 1 + 42 x 4 + 29 x 4\n    which is 1094 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1095. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 2, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 5, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 5, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "I need to analyze this situation carefully to make the best decision.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the current situation\n\n- My outside offer value: 1095\n- My item values:\n  - Item 1: 79 per unit (6 units total)\n  - Item 2: 84 per unit (5 units total)\n  - Item 3: 74 per unit (1 unit total)\n  - Item 4: 42 per unit (5 units total)\n  - Item 5: 29 per unit (4 units total)\n- Discount factor: 0.98 (we're currently in round 2, so any deal would be worth 0.98^(2-1) = 0.98 of its face value)\n\n### Step 2: Assess the current offer from Player 2\n\nPlayer 2 has offered me [0, 0, 0, 5, 1], meaning I would keep:\n- Item 1: 6 units (all)\n- Item 2: 5 units (all)\n- Item 3: 1 unit (all)\n- Item 4: 0 units (none)\n- Item 5: 3 units\n\nValue calculation:\n- 6 \u00d7 79 = 474 (item 1)\n- 5 \u00d7 84 = 420 (item 2)\n- 1 \u00d7 74 = 74 (item 3)\n- 0 \u00d7 42 = 0 (item 4)\n- 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (item 5)\n\nTotal value = 1055\n\nWith discount factor: 1055 \u00d7 0.98 = 1033.9\n\nThis is less than my outside offer of 1095, so accepting would be a mistake.\n\n### Step 3: Consider Player 2's preferences based on their offer\n\nPlayer 2 is offering me all of item 4 and only 1 unit of item 5. This suggests they value item 5 more than item 4. My first offer was to give them 2 units of item 4 and 3 units of item 5, which they countered by asking for none of item 4 and only 1 unit of item 5.\n\nThey also didn't ask for any of items 1, 2, or 3, which suggests they might value these less than items 4 and 5.\n\n### Step 4: Formulate a counteroffer\n\nI should keep enough value to exceed my outside offer of 1095, even after applying the discount factor.\n\nLet me try keeping all of items 1, 2, and 3 (which are my highest value items), and make some concessions on items 4 and 5:\n\n- Keep all of item 1: 6 \u00d7 79 = 474\n- Keep all of item 2: 5 \u00d7 84 = 420\n- Keep all of item 3: 1 \u00d7 74 = 74\n- Keep 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 42 = 126\n- Keep 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 29 = 29\n\nTotal: 474 + 420 + 74 + 126 + 29 = 1123\n\nWith discount: 1123 \u00d7 0.98 = 1100.54, which exceeds my outside offer.\n\nThis means I would offer Player 2:\n- 0 units of item 1\n- 0 units of item 2\n- 0 units of item 3\n- 2 units of item 4\n- 3 units of item 5\n\nThis is exactly my original offer. Let me try a slight adjustment to see if I can find a better counteroffer that still meets my needs.\n\nWhat if I keep all of items 1, 2, and 3, but give them 3 units of item 4 and 2 units of item 5:\n- Keep all of item 1: 6 \u00d7 79 = 474\n- Keep all of item 2: 5 \u00d7 84 = 420\n- Keep all of item 3: 1 \u00d7 74 = 74\n- Keep 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 42 = 84\n- Keep 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 29 = 58\n\nTotal: 474 + 420 + 74 + 84 + 58 = 1110\n\nWith discount: 1110 \u00d7 0.98 = 1087.8, which is slightly less than my outside offer of 1095.\n\nLet me try one more option:\n- Keep all of item 1: 6 \u00d7 79 = 474\n- Keep all of item 2: 5 \u00d7 84 = 420\n- Keep all of item 3: 1 \u00d7 74 = 74\n- Keep 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 42 = 126\n- Keep 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 29 = 58\n\nTotal: 474 + 420 + 74 + 126 + 58 = 1152\n\nWith discount: 1152 \u00d7 0.98 = 1128.96, which exceeds my outside offer.\n\nThis means I would offer Player 2:\n- 0 units of item 1\n- 0 units of item 2\n- 0 units of item 3\n- 2 units of item 4\n- 2 units of item 5\n\n### Step 5: Make a decision\n\nSince the current offer from Player 2 gives me a value (1033.9) less than my outside offer (1095), I should not accept it. \n\nI should counteroffer with [0, 0, 0, 2, 2], which gives me a value of 1128.96 after discount, exceeding my outside offer while making a small concession from my original offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 2, 2]}",

That gives me an undiscounted value of \n\u2003\u20032\u00d717 + 2\u00d756 = 34 + 112 = 146,\nand after the round-2 discount (0.98) only about 143.\n\n\u2022 My outside option is 1111 (and if I walk I get that full amount, with no discount). In order to agree on a deal in round 2 rather than walk away, I\u2019d need a deal that (even when discounted by 0.98) beats 1111. That means, undiscounted, I would need a bundle worth at least 1111/0.98 \u2248 1134. Given that my total value if I got everything would be 1291, I only have a \u201clucky\u201d margin of roughly 157 points. \n\n\u2022 In any counteroffer I make, I must offer Player 1 enough items so that his expected value (given his unknown private numbers but an average around 51 per point) is at least as high as what he already implied by his current offer \u2013 roughly around an expected value of 867. To guarantee that while retaining enough to be worth 1134 for me is essentially impossible as I would have to \u201csacrifice\u201d many units from items that I highly value (items 1, 2, and 3) and items I don\u2019t mind giving away (e.g. item 4) alone cannot supply enough of a concession without greatly reducing my own potential total. A rough \u201coptimization\u201d shows that any division that gives him a comparable payoff would force me to sacrifice too much (losing at least 17 points per item in the best\u2010case scenario, and since I must concede, in total almost certainly more than 157 points of value).\n\n\u2022 In short, the current offer is far below my reservation value and any counteroffer I might propose that will entice Player 1 to agree (given his current offer in round 2) would leave me with a value far below my own outside offer.\n\nTherefore, it is best for me to WALK away and secure my outside offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Item 5: 37 per unit\n\nLet me construct an initial offer that gives away some of my lower-valued items while keeping enough to exceed my outside offer value of 1226.\n\nIf I try to keep:\n- All of item 1 (6 units): 6 \u00d7 86 = 516\n- All of item 2 (4 units): 4 \u00d7 86 = 344\n- All of item 3 (5 units): 5 \u00d7 91 = 455\n- All of item 4 (2 units): 2 \u00d7 69 = 138\n- None of item 5 (0 units): 0 \u00d7 37 = 0\n\nThis would give me a total value of 516 + 344 + 455 + 138 = 1453, which exceeds my outside offer of 1226.\n\nSo I could offer all 6 units of item 5 to Player 2 and keep all the rest. But that might not be appealing to them. Let me refine the offer to include some other items:\n\nIf I keep:\n- 5 units of item 1: 5 \u00d7 86 = 430\n- 4 units of item 2: 4 \u00d7 86 = 344\n- 5 units of item 3: 5 \u00d7 91 = 455\n- 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 69 = 69\n- 0 units of item 5: 0 \u00d7 37 = 0\n\nMy total value would be 430 + 344 + 455 + 69 = 1298, which still exceeds my outside offer of 1226.\n\nThis means I could offer:\n- 1 unit of item 1\n- 0 units of item 2\n- 0 units of item 3\n- 1 unit of item 4\n- 6 units of item 5\n\nThis seems like a reasonable starting offer that keeps most of my high-value items while giving Player 2 some items to work with.\n\n### Step 4: Verify the offer is better than my outside option\nMy value from keeping the items specified would be 1298, which is greater than my outside offer of 1226.\n\nTherefore, I will make a counteroffer where I give the following to Player 2:\n[1, 0, 0, 1, 6]\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 1, 6]}",

In round\u202f1 I have a good chance to \u201credirect\u201d the allocation to capture more of the high\u2010value items (in my case, item\u202f3) while \u201coffering\u201d Player\u202f1 items that are less central for me (like some or all of item\u202f2 and portions of item\u202f1 or item\u202f4). \n\nStep 3: I can propose a counteroffer. Remember, when I propose a counteroffer I state what I give to Player\u202f1; my own share then is the leftover. My idea is to ask for all of item\u202f3 so I may enjoy its 5 units \u00d7 98 = 490 points, while giving Player\u202f1 \u201cthe rest\u201d for each item. For example, consider if I propose to give Player\u202f1 the following:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u202f1: 3 units (so I keep 6 \u2013 3 = 3 units, value 3\u00d750 = 150)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u202f2: 4 units (I keep 0, but my value per unit is lower at 27)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u202f3: 0 units (I keep all 5, value 5\u00d798 = 490)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u202f4: 1 unit (so I keep 2 \u2013 1 = 1 unit, value 1\u00d762 = 62)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u202f5: 6 units (so I keep 6 \u2013 6 = 0 units; note that although item\u202f5\u2019s value is 46 a unit, I\u2019m ready to \u201clet it go\u201d for negotiating reasons)\nThen my total value becomes 150 + 490 + 62 = 702. I am countering the very uneven current offer (which left me 0 of the high\u2010value item3) with one that gives me a much higher present value.\n\nStep 4: Even though I must be mindful that Player\u202f1\u2019s private values are unknown and they might use a similar reasoning, the fact that my current alternative (388) is far worse than 702 (if they accept immediately) makes this a promising counteroffer. Waiting also introduces a discount so it is beneficial to \u201csettle\u201d in a high\u2010value round if possible.\n\nThus, my action in round 1 is to make a counteroffer with the offer vector: [3, 4, 0, 1, 6].\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3,4,0,1,6]}",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 4, 5, 1, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    86 x 2 + 86 x 4 + 91 x 5 + 69 x 1 + 37 x 5\n    which is 1225 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1226. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 1, 6]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 4, 0, 1, 6]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 4, 0, 1, 6]\n\n    What is your action?

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 472. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 472. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 666 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 4, 1, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    15 x 3 + 54 x 4 + 56 x 1 + 20 x 0 + 77 x 2\n    which is 471 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 472. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Make a strategic split on mid-value items (2, 4)\n\nLet me try an initial offer where I give Player 2:\n- 4 units of item 1 (I keep 1): I give up 24, keep 6\n- 2 units of item 2 (I keep 3): I give up 96, keep 144\n- 1 unit of item 3 (I keep 3): I give up 98, keep 294\n- 2 units of item 4 (I keep 3): I give up 118, keep 177\n- 1 unit of item 5 (I keep 3): I give up 81, keep 243\n\nMy total value from this split: 6 + 144 + 294 + 177 + 243 = 864\n\nThis is significantly better than my outside offer of 318, so this offer makes sense for me.\n\n## 3) Decision\n\nI'll make a counteroffer giving Player 2 [4,2,1,2,1], meaning I keep [1,3,3,3,3].\n\nThis offer gives me a total value of 864, which is well above my outside offer of 318. It also leaves some room for negotiation in future rounds if necessary, while giving the other player a reasonable portion of the items.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4,2,1,2,1]}",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 1, 5, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    91 x 2 + 20 x 0 + 37 x 1 + 65 x 5 + 45 x 0\n    which is 544 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 545. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

I have no direct access to their private values but I know that each item\u2019s per\u2013unit value for them is drawn from U(1,101) (so the average is around 51). Thus, to give them \u201cgood value\u201d from their own perspective I want to allocate more units in those items where my value is low compared to the average. For me the cheapest is item\u20093 (value 18 per unit) and next item\u20091 (value 34 per unit). Conceding these units costs me little while \u2013 in expectation \u2013 giving Player\u20091 roughly 51 per unit.\n\nFor example, if I were to \u201csacrifice\u201d (i.e. offer to P1)\n\u2003\u2013 all 3 units of item 3\u2003(cost = 3\u00d718 = 54)\nand additionally 5 units of item 1\u2003(cost = 5\u00d734 = 170),\nthe total \u201closs\u201d to me would be 54 + 170 = 224.\nThat would leave me with \n\u20031043 \u2013 224 = 819,\nwhich is above my outside offer of 798. (If I gave even more, I\u2019d lose too much; if I gave less, Player\u20091 might be tempted to keep walking since on average an offered unit is \u201cworth\u201d about 51 for them.) \n\nThus one natural counteroffer is to request for myself:\n\u2003\u2013 From item\u20091: I keep 7\u20135 = 2 units.\n\u2003\u2013 From item\u20092: I give 0 (keeping all 2 units).\n\u2003\u2013 From item\u20093: I keep 3\u20133 = 0 units.\n\u2003\u2013 From item\u20094: I keep all 5 units.\n\u2003\u2013 From item\u20095: I keep all 4 units.\nAnd give Player\u20091:\n\u2003\u2013 Item\u20091: 5, item\u20092: 0, item\u20093: 3, item\u20094: 0, item\u20095: 0.\n(Checking my own total value: 2\u00d734 + 2\u00d770 + 0\u00d718 + 5\u00d755 + 4\u00d784 = 68+140+0+275+336 = 819.)\n\nThis counteroffer gives me 819 (a clear improvement over 798) while offering Player\u20091 5\u2009units of item\u20091 and all 3 units of item\u20093 (for an expected \u201cmarket\u2010value\u201d of about 5\u00d751 + 3\u00d751 \u2248 408).

(Any deal in round\u20091 has no discount so this offer must pass the \u201cno\u2013deal\u201d threshold for me.)\n\nThus, my action is to make a counteroffer with offer vector [5, 0, 3, 0, 0].\n\nMy answer in the required JSON format is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [5, 0, 3, 0, 0]}",

                    "prompt": "\n    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\n    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\n    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\n    There are 7 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\n    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\n    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 101.\n    Your private values are 91 for item 1, 20 for item 2, 37 for item 3, 65 for item 4, 45 for item 5.\n    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to your total value of all items, which is 1293. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 545. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 545. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 774 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 1, 5, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    91 x 2 + 20 x 0 + 37 x 1 + 65 x 5 + 45 x 0\n    which is 544 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 545. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Based on my values:\n- Item 3 has the lowest value (12 per unit)\n- Items 1 and 5 have moderate value (54 and 23 per unit)\n- Items 2 and 4 have the highest value (62 per unit)\n\nLet me create an offer that gives away most of the low-value items while keeping most of the high-value ones:\n\nPotential offer to Player 2: [1, 1, 7, 0, 3]\n- Keeping for myself: [3, 4, 1, 3, 1]\n\nValue of what I keep:\n- Item 1: 3 \u00d7 54 = 162\n- Item 2: 4 \u00d7 62 = 248\n- Item 3: 1 \u00d7 12 = 12\n- Item 4: 3 \u00d7 62 = 186\n- Item 5: 1 \u00d7 23 = 23\n- Total value: 631\n\nThis is significantly higher than my outside offer of 210, so it's a good starting offer.\n\n## Step 4: Avoid the five mistakes\n- This offer is my first one, so Mistake 1 doesn't apply\n- The value of what I keep (631) is higher than my outside offer (210), so Mistake 2 is avoided\n- I'm not offering no items or all items, so Mistake 3 is avoided\n- Mistakes 4 and 5 aren't applicable for the initial offer\n\nThis offer is strategic because:\n1. I'm giving away most of my lowest-value item (Item 3)\n2. I'm keeping all of my high-value Item 4\n3. I'm keeping most of my high-value Item 2\n4. I'm offering a fair amount of Item 5, which isn't very valuable to me\n5. The value to me (631) is well above my outside offer (210)\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 7, 0, 3]}",

In order to do better than my fallback, I need a deal that gives me more than 378 points (remember discount in round 1 is just 1). Without knowing Player 1\u2019s private values we must try to make a proposal that is \u201cfair\u201d from my perspective so that they\u2019re (hopefully) at least as well off as taking their outside option. One standard idea is to aim for a 50\u201350 split of the total available value. (My total value if I obtained everything would be 823, so an equal split for me would be about 411\u2013412.) \n\nI value item types very differently (my per\u2010unit values are: 66, 28, 14, 49, 40). Because I place high value on items 1, 4, and 5 and lower value on items 2 and especially 3, I prefer to keep items 1, 4, and 5 for myself while conceding the \u201ccheaper\u201d items (2 and 3) to Player 1. One natural division is for me to take everything in items 1, 4, and 5 and give away all of items 2 and 3. In that case my allocation would be:\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: all 4 units (4 \u2013 0)\n\u2003\u2003Item 2: none (5 \u2013 5)\n\u2003\u2003Item 3: none (8 \u2013 8)\n\u2003\u2003Item 4: all 3 units (3 \u2013 0)\n\u2003\u2003Item 5: none (4 \u2013 4)\nThis yields me a total value of 66\u00d74 + 49\u00d73 = 264 + 147 = 411, which is clearly above my outside offer (and reasonably close to a \u201cfair\u201d 50\u201350 split from my perspective).\n\nI now propose to offer Player 1 exactly the complementary division: give them everything in items 2, 3, and 5, and keep items 1 and 4 for myself. In our protocol a counteroffer is expressed as the quantities offered to the other player. The totals available are [4, 5, 8, 3, 4], so giving Player 1 items 2, 3, and 5 means my counteroffer is:\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 0 units,\n\u2003\u2003Item 2: 5 units,\n\u2003\u2003Item 3: 8 units,\n\u2003\u2003Item 4: 0 units,\n\u2003\u2003Item 5: 4 units.\n\nThis is a valid offer and gives me a present value of 411 which beats my outside option while (I hope) leaving Player 1 with a competitive alternative relative to their own outside offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 5, 8, 0, 4]}",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 3, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    54 x 0 + 62 x 0 + 12 x 0 + 62 x 3 + 23 x 1\n    which is 209 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 210. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 7, 0, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 5, 8, 0, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 5, 8, 0, 4]\n\n    What is your action?

Evaluating Current Offer\n\nPlayer 2 is offering me: [0, 5, 8, 0, 4]\nLet me calculate what I would get:\n- 0 units of item 1: 0 \u00d7 54 = 0\n- 5 units of item 2: 5 \u00d7 62 = 310\n- 8 units of item 3: 8 \u00d7 12 = 96\n- 0 units of item 4: 0 \u00d7 62 = 0\n- 4 units of item 5: 4 \u00d7 23 = 92\n- Total value: 498\n- Discounted value (round 2): 498 \u00d7 0.98 = 488.04\n\nThis is significantly better than my outside offer of 210.\n\n## 3. Analyzing Player 2's Preferences\n\nBased on Player 2's offer, they seem to value:\n- Item 1 highly (keeping all 4 units)\n- Item 4 highly (keeping all 3 units)\n- Items 2, 3, and 5 less (offering all of these to me)\n\n## 4. Evaluating My Previous Offer\n\nMy previous offer to Player 2 was [1, 1, 7, 0, 3], meaning I wanted to keep:\n- 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 54 = 162\n- 4 units of item 2: 4 \u00d7 62 = 248\n- 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 12 = 12\n- 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 62 = 186\n- 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 23 = 23\n- Total value: 631\n\n## 5. Decision Making\n\nPlayer 2's offer gives me a value of 488.04, which is much better than my outside offer of 210.\n\nI could make a counteroffer to try to get a better deal, but there's a risk Player 2 might walk away in the final round. Given that Player 2 is keeping exactly what they seem to value most (items 1 and 4), this appears to be a favorable division based on our different preferences.\n\nSince this offer:\n1. Is significantly better than my outside offer\n2. Gives me all of the items that Player 2 seems to value less\n3.

It gives Player 2 some of each item type, which seems fair, while keeping more of my high-value item 4.\n\nFor my first offer to Player 2, I will propose:\n[1, 2, 3, 1, 3]\n\nThis means I'm offering Player 2:\n- 1 unit of item 1\n- 2 units of item 2\n- 3 units of item 3\n- 1 unit of item 4\n- 3 units of item 5\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 3, 1, 3]}",

Our private per\u2011unit values are: item 1 = 47, item 2 = 42, item 3 = 88, item 4 = 31, and item 5 = 77. Thus, the value if we accept is:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 1 \u00d7 47 = 47\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 2 \u00d7 42 = 84\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 3 \u00d7 88 = 264\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 1 \u00d7 31 = 31\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 3 \u00d7 77 = 231\n\u2003Total = 47 + 84 + 264 + 31 + 231 = 657.\n\n2. Note that our private outside offer (the \u201cdisagreement value\u201d) is 1210, which is far higher than 657. Since if you walk away you secure 1210 for sure, any deal that gives less than 1210 in our own evaluation is strictly worse than our fallback.\n\n3. Even if we consider making a counteroffer, we run into a strategic problem. The total available items, if allocated entirely to us, give us a maximum of 1211 (since 2\u00d747 + 4\u00d742 + 5\u00d788 + 4\u00d731 + 5\u00d777 = 1211). In order to make any counteroffer acceptable to Player 1, we would have to concede some items. However, conceding even one unit (even of our \u201cleast\u2010valuable\u201d item, item 4 at 31 per unit) would drop our total below 1210. For example, giving up 1 unit of item 4 would leave us with a value of 1211 \u2013 31 = 1180, which is worse than our guaranteed 1210 outside offer.\n\n4. Thus, any counteroffer that makes Player 1 whole would force us to lose too much value. Accepting the current offer gives 657 and any counteroffer that concedes even minimally would yield us less than our disagreement payoff.\n\n5. Therefore, the best action available is to walk away from negotiations and secure our outside offer of 1210.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 513. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 444 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 3, 1, 4, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    13 x 3 + 43 x 3 + 8 x 1 + 18 x 4 + 66 x 4\n    which is 512 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 513. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Because of the discounting and the fact that Player\u00a01\u2019s outside option is also unknown (but likely competitive), any counteroffer that doesn\u2019t approximately preserve their nearly \u201cfull\u201d share will be turned down. \n\nThus, since the current offer gives me a much lower payoff (78) than my fallback (229) and I cannot credibly re-divide without hurting Player\u00a01\u2019s incentive to accept (and risk further delay with discounting), my best action is to WALK away. \n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",
