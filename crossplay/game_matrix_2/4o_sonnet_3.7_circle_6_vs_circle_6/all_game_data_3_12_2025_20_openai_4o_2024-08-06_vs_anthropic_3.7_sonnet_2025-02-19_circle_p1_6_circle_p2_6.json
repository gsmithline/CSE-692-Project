Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 662. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 662. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 450 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 0, 1, 13, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    20 x 4 + 5 x 0 + 57 x 1 + 32 x 13 + 36 x 3\n    which is 661 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 662. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To decide the best course of action, let's break down the situation step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 662.\n  \n- **Value of the Items:**\n  - Item 1: 6 units, value per unit = 20\n  - Item 2: 3 units, value per unit = 5\n  - Item 3: 1 unit, value per unit = 57\n  - Item 4: 13 units, value per unit = 32\n  - Item 5: 4 units, value per unit = 36\n  - Total value if I receive all items = (6*20) + (3*5) + (1*57) + (13*32) + (4*36) = 752\n\n- **Total Pool of Items:** [6, 3, 1, 13, 4]\n\n- **Discount Factor:** The discount factor (gamma) is 0.98. Since this is round 1, I should focus on getting more than my outside offer without worrying about gamma right now, as its effect is stronger in later rounds.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer:** There is no current offer.\n\n- **Potential Counteroffers:**\n  I need to construct an offer that gives me more than my outside offer value of 662. \n\n  A practical division strategy would be to start by taking most of the high-value items and see if the total exceeds my outside offer:\n\n  Suppose I offer Player 2 the following items: [2, 3, 0, 0, 2].\n  - I keep: [4, 0, 1, 13, 2]\n  - My value for this division:\n    - Item 1: 4 * 20 = 80\n    - Item 2: 0 * 5 = 0\n    - Item 3: 1 * 57 = 57\n    - Item 4: 13 * 32 = 416\n    - Item 5: 2 * 36 = 72\n  - Total Value = 80 + 0 + 57 + 416 + 72 = 625\n\n  This offer didn't work as it results in 625, which is less than 662.\n\n  Trying another division: [2, 2, 0, 1, 1]\n  - I keep: [4, 1, 1, 12, 3]\n  - My calculations:\n    - Item 1: 4 * 20 = 80\n    - Item 2: 1 * 5 = 5\n    - Item 3: 1 * 57 = 57\n    - Item 4: 12 * 32 = 384\n    - Item 5: 3 * 36 = 108\n  - Total Value = 80 + 5 + 57 + 384 + 108 = 634\n\n  Adjusting further: [1, 2, 0, 3, 1]\n  - I keep: [5, 1, 1, 10, 3]\n  - My calculations:\n    - Item 1: 5 * 20 = 100\n    - Item 2: 1 * 5 = 5\n    - Item 3: 1 * 57 = 57\n    - Item 4: 10 * 32 = 320\n    - Item 5: 3 * 36 = 108\n  - Total Value = 100 + 5 + 57 + 320 + 108 = 590\n\n  Finally: [1, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n  - I keep: [5, 2, 1, 12, 3]\n  - My value:\n    - Item 1: 5 * 20 = 100\n    - Item 2: 2 * 5 = 10\n    - Item 3: 1 * 57 = 57\n    - Item 4: 12 * 32 = 384\n    - Item 5: 3 * 36 = 108\n  - Total Value = 100 + 10 + 57 + 384 + 108 = 659\n\n  Further adjusting to: [1, 1, 0, 0, 2]\n  - I keep: [5, 2, 1, 13, 2]\n  - My value:\n    - Item 1: 5 * 20 = 100\n    - Item 2: 2 * 5 = 10\n    - Item 3: 1 * 57 = 57\n    - Item 4: 13 * 32 = 416\n    - Item 5: 2 * 36 = 72\n  - Total Value = 100 + 10 + 57 + 416 + 72 = 655\n\nTrying once more: [1, 0, 0, 2, 1]\n  - I keep: [5, 3, 1, 11, 3]\n  - My value:\n    - Item 1: 5 * 20 = 100\n    - Item 2: 3 * 5 = 15\n    - Item 3: 1 * 57 = 57\n    - Item 4: 11 * 32 = 352\n    - Item 5: 3 * 36 = 108\n  - Total Value = 100 + 15 + 57 + 352 + 108 = 632\n\nRefining further: [1, 0, 0, 0, 3]\n  - I keep: [5, 3, 1, 13, 1]\n  - My value:\n    - Item 1: 5 * 20 = 100\n    - Item 2: 3 * 5 = 15\n    - Item 3: 1 * 57 = 57\n    - Item 4: 13 * 32 = 416\n    - Item 5: 1 * 36 = 36\n  - Total Value = 100 + 15 + 57 + 416 + 36 = 624\n\nAfter layout out several proposals, an optimal way must include me retaining the maximum possible value without going below 662 in total. I need to recalibrate and optimize further to reach a value beyond 662.\n\nCounteroffer: [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n- I keep: [5, 2, 1, 13, 4]\n- My value:\n  - Item 1: 5 * 20 = 100\n  - Item 2: 2 * 5 = 10\n  - Item 3: 1 * 57 = 57\n  - Item 4: 13 * 32 = 416\n  - Item 5: 4 * 36 = 144\n- Total Value = 100 + 10 + 57 + 416 + 144 = 727\n\n### Step 3: Decision\n\nBased on the above calculations, I propose the counteroffer [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]. This allocation maximizes my share to a greater value than my outside offer, ensuring a successful negotiation outcome for me, while offering a small, likely palatable portion to Player 2.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 0, 1, 13, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    20 x 4 + 5 x 0 + 57 x 1 + 32 x 13 + 36 x 3\n    which is 661 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 662. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [5, 2, 0, 10, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [5, 2, 0, 10, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To decide my action, let's analyze the current situation step by step.\n\n### 1) Analyze the Current Situation:\n\n- **My Outside Offer Value:** 662\n- **My Values for Items:**\n  - Item 1: 20\n  - Item 2: 5\n  - Item 3: 57\n  - Item 4: 32\n  - Item 5: 36\n- **Total Pool of Items:**\n  - 6 units of Item 1\n  - 3 units of Item 2\n  - 1 unit of Item 3\n  - 13 units of Item 4\n  - 4 units of Item 5\n\nI've been offered: [5, 2, 0, 10, 1] (total value for me):\n  - 5 units of Item 1 = 5 \u00d7 20 = 100\n  - 2 units of Item 2 = 2 \u00d7 5 = 10\n  - 0 units of Item 3 = 0 \u00d7 57 = 0\n  - 10 units of Item 4 = 10 \u00d7 32 = 320\n  - 1 unit of Item 5 = 1 \u00d7 36 = 36\n  - **Total value of current offer = 466**\n\n- **Discount factor influence:** Since it is round 2, if we end negotiations now by accepting, there will be a reduced value since gamma = 0.98. However, since it is in my best interest to compare offers after considering the discount, immediate comparison to my outside offer helps as well.\n\n### 2) Assess the value of offers:\n\n- **Current offer's value to me (before discount): 466**\n- **My outside offer value:** 662\n\nThe current offer (466) is considerably worse than my outside offer value (662). Accepting it would be a mistake. I must attempt to propose a counteroffer that brings my value up near or above my outside offer value.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision Based on Analysis:\n\nTo avoid the five highlighted mistakes, I should determine a counteroffer where my retained value exceeds my outside offer. A potential counteroffer is based on splitting items to maximize my interests:\n\nA potential counteroffer offering [1, 1, 0, 5, 0] to Player 2:\n- I keep [5, 2, 1, 8, 4]\n  - 5 units of Item 1 = 5 \u00d7 20 = 100\n  - 2 units of Item 2 = 2 \u00d7 5 = 10\n  - 1 unit of Item 3 = 1 \u00d7 57 = 57\n  - 8 units of Item 4 = 8 \u00d7 32 = 256\n  - 4 units of Item 5 = 4 \u00d7 36 = 144\n  - **Total value for me = 567**\n\n567 is still below my outside offer value of 662, which means this is not favorable. I would not be able to propose a valid counteroffer unless I can get above this total value. Therefore, taking the outside offer seems the best option without proceeding below my outside offer and making critical mistakes.\n\nGiven the situation, my best move is to walk away from the negotiation.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Therefore, it can be more beneficial to settle sooner rather than later if a satisfactory offer is on the table.\n\n2) **Assess the value of potential offers:**\n\n   Since there is no current offer from Player 2, we should evaluate potential offers that I could make to Player 2.\n\n   Let's start by considering a fair initial offer while ensuring that what I retain provides a value greater than my outside offer of 559.\n\n   If I aim to maximize my value while still making a feasible offer to Player 2, I need to calculate and propose a division of items.\n\n3) **Decision-making based on analysis:**\n\n   I'll propose offering a modest number of items to Player 2 to start, ensuring my retained value is above my outside offer. Let's calculate one potential counteroffer:\n\n   Suppose I propose to keep the following units: \n   - Item 1: 0 units (none available)\n   - Item 2: 4 units (leaving 4 for Player 2)\n   - Item 3: 3 units (leaving 3 for Player 2)\n   - Item 4: 2 units (leaving 2 for Player 2)\n   - Item 5: 2 units (leaving 2 for Player 2)\n\n   My retained value calculation:\n   - Item 2: 4 units x 19 = 76\n   - Item 3: 3 units x 86 = 258\n   - Item 4: 2 units x 54 = 108\n   - Item 5: 2 units x 25 = 50\n\n   Total retained value: 76 + 258 + 108 + 50 = 492\n\n   This retained value is less than my outside offer of 559. Let's try a new allocation to ensure the total value retained is greater.\n\n   New consideration:\n   - Item 1: 0 units (none available)\n   - Item 2: 7 units (leaving 1 for Player 2)\n   - Item 3: 5 units (leaving 1 for Player 2)\n   - Item 4: 4 units (leaving 0 for Player 2)\n   - Item 5: 2 units (leaving 2 for Player 2)\n\n   New retained value calculation:\n   - Item 2: 7 units x 19 = 133\n   - Item 3: 5 units x 86 = 430\n   - Item 4: 4 units x 54 = 216\n   - Item 5: 2 units x 25 = 50\n\n   Total retained value: 133 + 430 + 216 + 50 = 829\n\nThis allocation gives a retained value of 829, which is well above my outside offer of 559.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 2, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    59 x 0 + 70 x 0 + 10 x 2 + 66 x 0 + 52 x 0\n    which is 20 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 25. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 1, 0, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 1, 0, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 62. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 62. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 831 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 3, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    66 x 0 + 86 x 0 + 19 x 3 + 53 x 0 + 53 x 0\n    which is 57 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 62. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 3, 0, 0, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 3, 0, 0, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 727. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 727. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 798 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 5, 3, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    47 x 1 + 54 x 1 + 61 x 5 + 100 x 3 + 4 x 5\n    which is 726 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 727. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 0, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 1, 3, 2, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [4, 1, 3, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [4, 1, 4, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [4, 1, 4, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Analyze the Current Situation:\n- **My outside offer value:** 942\n- **Values of the items involved:**\n  - Item 1: 33 per unit\n  - Item 2: 26 per unit\n  - Item 3: 22 per unit\n  - Item 4: 73 per unit\n  - Item 5: 65 per unit\n- **Total pool of items:**\n  - 7 units of item 1\n  - 2 units of item 2\n  - 3 units of item 3\n  - 8 units of item 4\n  - 4 units of item 5\n- **Discount factor influence:** The longer the negotiation goes on, the value of the received offer is slightly decreased due to the discount factor (gamma = 0.98).\n\n### 2. Assess the Value of Offers:\n- **Current offer value to me:** There is no current offer on the table.\n- **Potential counteroffers:** I must consider offers where the value I'll receive is at least the outside offer value of 942.\n\nFor example, if I consider keeping all items:\n- 7 \u00d7 33 = 231 (Item 1)\n- 2 \u00d7 26 = 52 (Item 2)\n- 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (Item 3)\n- 8 \u00d7 73 = 584 (Item 4)\n- 4 \u00d7 65 = 260 (Item 5)\n- Total = 1193\n\nSince I need to propose an initial offer, I should find one where my total value is slightly above or close to my outside offer, considering the game can go for additional rounds.\n\nFor example, if I propose:\n- Offer the opponent 3 items of item 1, 1 item of item 2, 1 item of item 3, 2 items of item 4, 1 item of item 5.\n\nThe values I would receive are:\n- 4 \u00d7 33 = 132 (Item 1)\n- 1 \u00d7 26 = 26 (Item 2)\n- 2 \u00d7 22 = 44 (Item 3)\n- 6 \u00d7 73 = 438 (Item 4)\n- 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (Item 5)\n- Total value = 835, which is lower than my outside offer. Therefore, this isn't a viable option.\n\nLet's adjust proportions. I will try another configuration where I keep more valuable items:\n- Offer the opponent 2 items of item 1, 0 items of item 2, 1 item of item 3, 2 items of item 4, 1 item of item 5.\n\nValues I would receive:\n- 5 \u00d7 33 = 165 (Item 1)\n- 2 \u00d7 26 = 52 (Item 2)\n- 2 \u00d7 22 = 44 (Item 3)\n- 6 \u00d7 73 = 438 (Item 4)\n- 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (Item 5)\n- Total value = 894, which is still below my outside offer.\n\nReevaluate and try with:\n- Offer the opponent 2 items of each type except keep all items 4.\n\nValues I would receive:\n- 33 \u00d7 5 = 165 (Item 1)\n- 26 \u00d7 2 = 52 (Item 2)\n- 22 \u00d7 1 = 22 (Item 3)\n- 73 \u00d7 8 = 584 (Item 4)\n- 65 \u00d7 2 = 130 (Item 5)\n- Total value = 953, which is above my outside offer of 942.\n\nAs its value is above my outside offer, I will propose this as my initial offer.\n\n### 3. Make a Decision\nGiven the analysis above, I'll propose the counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 1, 0, 2]}\n```\n\nThis offer keeps my value at a sufficient level above my outside offer.",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 58. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 594 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 5, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    16 x 0 + 65 x 0 + 85 x 0 + 6 x 5 + 26 x 1\n    which is 56 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 58. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 1, 0, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 0, 1, 0, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 623. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1023 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 1, 3, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    99 x 0 + 47 x 1 + 89 x 1 + 22 x 3 + 84 x 5\n    which is 622 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 623. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Hence, concluding in earlier rounds is preferred.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\nSince there is currently no offer on the table, I will consider potential offers I could make. I should aim to retain items such that their total value exceeds my outside offer of 623. \n\nConsider retaining most valuable items and part of less valuable ones:\n\n#### Potential Offer 1: [3, 1, 2, 1, 2] to Player 2 (I keep [3, 2, 3, 2, 3])\n\n- Calculating value for myself by keeping:\n  - Items 1: 3 units = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297\n  - Items 2: 2 units = 2 \u00d7 47 = 94\n  - Items 3: 3 units = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267\n  - Items 4: 2 units = 2 \u00d7 22 = 44\n  - Items 5: 3 units = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252\n\n- **Total value = 297 + 94 + 267 + 44 + 252 = 954**\n\nThis offer is better than my outside offer (954 > 623).\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nGiven that my potential counteroffer's value is greater than my outside offer, and it leaves us with a reasonable division to potentially entice Player 2, it's a valid first offer.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 3, 0, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    22 x 0 + 46 x 0 + 69 x 3 + 75 x 0 + 20 x 3\n    which is 267 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 268. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 3, 0, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    22 x 0 + 46 x 0 + 69 x 3 + 75 x 0 + 20 x 3\n    which is 267 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 268. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 2, 3, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 2, 3, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 2, 3, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",

As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To analyze the current situation, let's break down the specifics:\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 1067.\n   - My values per unit of the items are:\n     - Item 1: 46\n     - Item 2: 74\n     - Item 3: 56\n     - Item 4: 58\n     - Item 5: 94\n   - The total pool of items is:\n     - 4 units of item 1\n     - 7 units of item 2\n     - 3 units of item 3\n     - 3 units of item 4\n     - 1 unit of item 5\n   - The discount factor gamma is 0.98. This means that if the negotiation extends to additional rounds, the value of any deal is reduced. Specifically, in round 1, the discount factor effect is negligible as gamma^0 = 1.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Currently, there's no offer on the table to accept, so I need to make an initial offer that maximizes my value compared to my outside offer of 1067.\n   - Let's consider potential divisions that could exceed my outside offer. One approach is to keep the majority of items with higher value per unit and try to offer fewer of those to Player 2.\n\n3) Make a decision:\n   - I need to make an initial offer ensuring that the ended value is greater than 1067. Here's one way to do it:\n     - Keep all units of item 5 due to its high value to me (94).\n     - Offer a division on other items that don't significantly lower my total value.\n   \n   Let's calculate a potential offer:\n   - Offering 0 units of item 5, 3 units of item 4, 2 units of item 3, 5 units of item 2, 2 units of item 1 to Player 2, allowing me to keep:\n     - Item 1: 2 units \u00d7 46 = 92\n     - Item 2: 2 units \u00d7 74 = 148\n     - Item 3: 1 unit \u00d7 56 = 56\n     - Item 4: 2 units \u00d7 58 = 116\n     - Item 5: 1 unit \u00d7 94 = 94\n\n   Calculating the value of what I keep under this offer:\n   - Total value = 92 + 148 + 56 + 116 + 94 = 506\n\n   Since 506 is less than my outside offer, this division is too conservative. I'll attempt another offer where I aim to better my outcome.\n\n   Let's try suggesting:\n   - Offer 1 unit of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5 to Player 2, keeping:\n     - Item 1: 3 units \u00d7 46 = 138\n     - Item 2: 4 units \u00d7 74 = 296\n     - Item 3: 2 units \u00d7 56 = 112\n     - Item 4: 3 units \u00d7 58 = 174\n     - Item 5: 1 unit \u00d7 94 = 94\n\n   Total value = 138 + 296 + 112 + 174 + 94 = 814\n\n   This attempt still falls short. I need to further adjust the split to target a value above 1067 to make a meaningful counteroffer. Let's try to keep more of the higher value item:\n\n   I'm proposing the following counteroffer to Player 2:\n   - Offer 0 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5 to Player 2, keeping:\n     - Item 1: 4 units \u00d7 46 = 184\n     - Item 2: 5 units \u00d7 74 = 370\n     - Item 3: 2 units \u00d7 56 = 112\n     - Item 4: 3 units \u00d7 58 = 174\n     - Item 5: 1 unit \u00d7 94 = 94\n     \n   Total value = 184 + 370 + 112 + 174 + 94 = 934\n   \n   This is still short of the target. Perhaps a more extreme distribution:\n\n   Let's try offering:\n   - Offer 0 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5 to Player 2, keeping:\n     - Item 1: 4 units \u00d7 46 = 184\n     - Item 2: 3 units \u00d7 74 = 222\n     - Item 3: 3 units \u00d7 56 = 168\n     - Item 4: 3 units \u00d7 58 = 174\n     - Item 5: 1 unit \u00d7 94 = 94\n\n   Total value = 184 + 222 + 168 + 174 + 94 = 842\n\n   Given this exercise, it seems I cannot achieve higher with a straightforward allocation. My understanding may still require adjustment to the full scenario, which cannot achieve in the model here.\n\n   However, for now, observing calculations, I'm not better off than initial expectations on the initiatives.\n\n   Nonetheless, based on reevaluating what I've assessed and basis forward indication, I shall counteroffer based on conclusions of values practiced:\n\n   Offering:\n   - Offer 0 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, and the splitting the rest more generously being strategic.\n\n   In essence, grounded from data demonstrated with an example of model:\n\n   {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 4, 3, 2, 0]}",

They don't seem to value items 1 and 3 much as they're giving all units to me.\n\n## 4) Decision Making\n\nThe current offer is worth 409 to me, which is far better than my outside offer of 80. However, since this is only round 1, I could try to improve my position with a counteroffer that keeps more of the high-value items for me (especially item 5) while still being attractive to Player 1.\n\nLet me consider a counteroffer where I try to get item 5 (my highest value item), keep all of item 3 (my second highest value), and make some concessions on the lower-value items:\n\nMy counteroffer to Player 1:\n- Item 1: 3 units (keeping 1 for myself)\n- Item 2: 5 units (keeping 2 for myself)\n- Item 3: 0 units (keeping all 3 for myself)\n- Item 4: 3 units (keeping 0 for myself)\n- Item 5: 0 units (keeping 1 for myself)\n\nValue for me if this offer is accepted:\n- 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 17 = 17\n- 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 9 = 18\n- 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285\n- 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 10 = 0\n- 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 98 = 98\n\nTotal value for me: 17 + 18 + 285 + 0 + 98 = 418\n\nThis counteroffer would give me a value of 418, which is higher than the current offer (409) and much higher than my outside offer (80).\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 5, 0, 3, 0]}",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 1067. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1067. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 984 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 6, 3, 3, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    46 x 4 + 74 x 6 + 56 x 3 + 58 x 3 + 94 x 1\n    which is 1064 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1067. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "To make an informed decision, let's walk through the analysis step-by-step:\n\n### 1) Analyze the Current Situation:\n- **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 1067.\n- **Values of the Items:**\n  - Item 1: 46 per unit\n  - Item 2: 74 per unit\n  - Item 3: 56 per unit\n  - Item 4: 58 per unit\n  - Item 5: 94 per unit\n- **Total Pool of Items:**\n  - 4 units of item 1\n  - 7 units of item 2\n  - 3 units of item 3\n  - 3 units of item 4\n  - 1 unit of item 5\n- **Discount Factor Influence:** The discount factor is 0.98. After round 2, any accepted deal will be multiplied by 0.98 to get the present value.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n- **Current Offer (from Player 2): [3, 5, 0, 3, 0]**\n  - My allocation under this offer: [1, 2, 3, 0, 1]\n  - Total value if I accept:\n    - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 46 = 46\n    - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 74 = 148\n    - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168\n    - 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 58 = 0\n    - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 94 = 94\n    - Total = 456\n  - After considering the discount factor for round 2 (gamma^1 = 0.98), the value = 456 * 0.98 = 446.88\n\n- **Comparison with Outside Offer:** My outside offer value is 1067, which is much higher than 446.88, so accepting this offer wouldn't make sense.\n\n- **Previous Offers:**\n  - My initial offer in round 1 was [4, 4, 3, 2, 0], with a value to me of 968 before discounting.\n\n- **Potential High-Value Counteroffer:** Propose [0, 5, 2, 2, 0] to Player 2 and see its value to me:\n  - Allocation to me: [4, 2, 1, 1, 1]\n  - Total value for this allocation:\n    - 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 46 = 184\n    - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 74 = 148\n    - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 56 = 56\n    - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 58 = 58\n    - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 94 = 94\n    - Total = 540\n  - After discount: 540 * 0.98 = 529.2\n\nSince the counteroffer still does not exceed my outside offer of 1067 in value, I will propose one more iteration. This time, let's avoid mistake 2 and propose more advantageous offers until we approach our outside offer.\n\nHere's an adjusted counteroffer: [0, 4, 2, 3, 0]\n- Allocation to me: [4, 3, 1, 0, 1]\n- Total value for this allocation:\n  - 4 x 46 + 3 x 74 + 1 x 56 + 0 x 58 + 1 x 94 = 500\n- After discount: 500 * 0.98 = 490\n\nEven this value is less than the outside offer, but it's still higher than previous counteroffers presented, which justifies an attempt at bargaining.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision:\nSince accepting the current offer results in receiving a total present value of 456.88 which is substantially lower than my outside offer, and my improved counteroffer is more optimal (strategically closer to 1067 after more revisions), I am willing to risk push one more attempt.\n\nHere's my decision in the stipulated format:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 4, 2, 3, 0]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 946. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 885 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 1, 5, 1, 8] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    13 x 2 + 79 x 1 + 42 x 5 + 94 x 1 + 67 x 8\n    which is 945 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 946. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To determine the best course of action, I'll break down the situation step by step:\n\n1) **Analysis of the Current Situation**:\n\n   - **Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer value is 946.\n   - **Values of Items**:\n     - Item 1: 13\n     - Item 2: 79\n     - Item 3: 42\n     - Item 4: 94\n     - Item 5: 67\n   - **Total Pool of Items**:\n     - 6 units of Item 1\n     - 5 units of Item 2\n     - 5 units of Item 3\n     - 2 units of Item 4\n     - 8 units of Item 5\n   - **Discount Factor**: The discount factor is 0.98, meaning that the value of each round's offers decreases slightly if delayed. This incentivizes finding a suitable agreement sooner rather than later.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers**:\n\n   No current offer is on the table, so I need to consider potential counteroffers that meet or exceed my outside offer value of 946.\n\n   Let's calculate potential counteroffers:\n\n   I need a total value greater than 946. Let's try giving Player 2 the following offer:\n\n   - Offer [3, 2, 2, 1, 4] (giving Player 2 three units of Item 1, two units of Item 2 and 3, one unit of Item 4, and four units of Item 5).\n     - This means I keep [3, 3, 3, 1, 4].\n     - Value for me:\n       - Item 1: 3 \u00d7 13 = 39\n       - Item 2: 3 \u00d7 79 = 237\n       - Item 3: 3 \u00d7 42 = 126\n       - Item 4: 1 \u00d7 94 = 94\n       - Item 5: 4 \u00d7 67 = 268\n     - Total Value for me = 764\n\n   This value of 764 is less than my outside offer of 946, so the proposal needs adjustment.\n\n   Adjust the offer to [3, 0, 0, 0, 2] (keeping the majority of valuable Items 2 and 4):\n\n   - This means I keep [3, 5, 5, 2, 6].\n   - Value for me:\n     - Item 1: 3 \u00d7 13 = 39\n     - Item 2: 5 \u00d7 79 = 395\n     - Item 3: 5 \u00d7 42 = 210\n     - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 94 = 188\n     - Item 5: 6 \u00d7 67 = 402\n   - Total Value for me = 1234\n\nThis value exceeds my outside offer, so I have a solid basis for a strong offer. \n\n3) **Decision**:\n   \n   Since I have no current offer from Player 2 and my calculated counteroffer yields a total value greater than my outside offer, this is a rational first proposal.\n\nBased on this analysis, I will proceed with making the counteroffer as outlined:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 0, 0, 0, 2]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 1, 5, 1, 8] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    13 x 2 + 79 x 1 + 42 x 5 + 94 x 1 + 67 x 8\n    which is 945 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 946. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 0, 0, 0, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 1, 0, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 1, 0, 3]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To determine my action, let's analyze the current situation step by step:\n\n### 1) Analyze the Current Situation:\n\n- **My Outside Offer Value**: 946\n- **Values of the Items to Me**: \n  - Item 1: 13\n  - Item 2: 79\n  - Item 3: 42\n  - Item 4: 94\n  - Item 5: 67\n\n- **Total Pool of Items**:\n  - 6 units of item 1\n  - 5 units of item 2\n  - 5 units of item 3\n  - 2 units of item 4\n  - 8 units of item 5\n\n- **Current Offer from Player 2**: `[0, 0, 1, 0, 3]` This means I would receive 1 unit of item 3 and 3 units of item 5.\n\n- **Value of Current Offer to Me**:\n  - 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 13 = 0\n  - 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 79 = 0\n  - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 42 = 42\n  - 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 94 = 0\n  - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201\n\n  Total value = 42 + 201 = 243\n\n- **Discount Factor Influence**: The current offer value to me, even if adjusted for future rounds' discount, is significantly less than my outside offer value.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Counteroffers:\n\nI need to find a division that provides a value more than my outside offer of 946. Here's a step-by-step consideration:\n\n1. **Initial Division Idea**: Let's explore various combinations to surpass my outside offer.\n  \n2. **Example Counteroffer Calculations**:\n   - Suppose I keep `[3, 3, 2, 2, 5]`, and offer Player 2 `[3, 2, 3, 0, 3]`:\n     - Value = 3 * 13 + 3 * 79 + 2 * 42 + 2 * 94 + 5 * 67 = 39 + 237 + 84 + 188 + 335 = 883\n\n   - Adjust strategy to improve my retained value:\n     - Let\u2019s modify to `[4, 3, 3, 1, 4]`, and offer `[2, 2, 2, 1, 4]`:\n     - Value = 4 * 13 + 3 * 79 + 3 * 42 + 1 * 94 + 4 * 67 = 52 + 237 + 126 + 94 + 268 = 777\n\n   - Continuing to find a higher value:\n     - If I keep `[5, 4, 2, 2, 5]` and offer `[1, 1, 3, 0, 3]`:\n     - Value = 5 * 13 + 4 * 79 + 2 * 42 + 2 * 94 + 5 * 67 = 65 + 316 + 84 + 188 + 335 = 988\n\n   This last division gets me to a value of 988, which is higher than my outside offer. Therefore, it presents a feasible counteroffer that meets my goal.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision:\n\nBased on the calculations, I should propose a counteroffer that maximizes my value while still being reasonable for Player 2:\n\n- **Counteroffer**: [1, 1, 3, 0, 3]\n\nThus, my action will be:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 3, 0, 3]}\n```",

Here's one such potential division:\n\n- [1, 1, 4, 0, 2] to give to Player 2, meaning you keep [5, 4, 1, 2, 6].\n- Value for you:\n  - 5 units of item 1 = 5 \u00d7 13 = 65\n  - 4 units of item 2 = 4 \u00d7 79 = 316\n  - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 42 = 42\n  - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 94 = 188\n  - 6 units of item 5 = 6 \u00d7 67 = 402\n- Total value = 1013\n- Present value (considering discount factor) = 1013 \u00d7 0.98^2 = 974.65\n\nSince 974.65 is more than your outside offer, this proposed division is superior to walking away.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision:\n\n- Accept the current offer? No, as its present value is much lower than your outside offer.\n- Walk away? No, as there\u2019s room to propose a division yielding higher value.\n- Propose Counteroffer? Yes, propose a counteroffer where [1, 1, 4, 0, 2] is offered to Player 2.\n\nBased on this analysis, I should propose the counteroffer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 4, 0, 2]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1492. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1005 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [6, 3, 5, 1, 8] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    84 x 6 + 92 x 3 + 71 x 5 + 50 x 1 + 38 x 8\n    which is 1489 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1492. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 269. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 894 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 1, 4, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    72 x 0 + 96 x 1 + 16 x 1 + 14 x 4 + 100 x 1\n    which is 268 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 269. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [4, 2, 6, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [4, 2, 6, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

I'll try to keep the high-value items for myself (especially items 2 and 5) while offering items I value less (especially items 3 and 4).\n\nLet me try an offer where I give Player 1:\n[1, 0, 5, 4, 0]\n\nThis means I keep:\n- 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216\n- 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 96 = 192\n- 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 16 = 16\n- 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 14 = 0\n- 5 units of item 5 = 5 \u00d7 100 = 500\n- Total value = 924\n\nThis is significantly higher than both my outside offer (269) and the current offer (576).\n\n## 5) Decision\n\nWhile I could accept Player 1's initial offer which is already good for me (576 > 269), I believe I can do better with a counteroffer. Player 1 seems to value items 4 and 5, but I particularly value item 5 (100 per unit) and item 2 (96 per unit). \n\nI'll offer a counteroffer that gives them all of items 3 and 4 (which I don't value much), some of item 1, but keeps the high-value items 2 and 5 for myself.

Future rounds would involve a discount, which would impact the present value of future negotiations. Therefore, reaching an agreement earlier, if favorable, is generally advantageous.\n\n### 2) Assess the value of offers:\n- **Current offer**: None on the table. Therefore, we need to make the initial offer.\n- **Potential counteroffer**:\n  Let\u2019s start by calculating potential counteroffers that result in a value higher than the outside offer value of 44 for myself, ensuring we do not fall into Mistake 2 (offering worse than the outside offer).\n\n  We will consider offering less valuable items in larger proportions to Player 2 to maximize the value of what we keep:\n  1.

Only keep items of lesser value that would increase my total to above 44.\n\n- **Example Offer Calculation**:\n  - Offer 7 units of Item 1 to Player 2\n  - Offer 0 units of Item 2\n  - Offer 0 units of Item 3\n  - Offer 2 units of Item 4\n  - Offer 0 units of Item 5\n\n  Let's calculate the value of keeping the remaining units:\n  - Keep Item 1: 0 units \u2192 Value: 0\n  - Keep Item 2: 3 units \u2192 Value: \\(3 \\times 37 = 111\\)\n  - Keep Item 3: 3 units \u2192 Value: \\(3 \\times 57 = 171\\)\n  - Keep Item 4: 3 units \u2192 Value: \\(3 \\times 42 = 126\\)\n  - Keep Item 5: 2 units \u2192 Value: \\(2 \\times 46 = 92\\)\n\n  Total value for me: \\(0 + 111 + 171 + 126 + 92 = 500\\), which is much higher than the outside offer of 44.\n\n### 3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n- Since there is no current offer, and our potential offer provides a high value of 500 (well above the 44 fallback outside offer value), it is advantageous to propose the counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [7, 0, 0, 2, 0]}\n```\n\nThis offer avoids all described mistakes and maximizes our gained value within the constraints.",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1132. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 864 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [7, 1, 3, 5, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    63 x 7 + 54 x 1 + 91 x 3 + 67 x 5 + 13 x 2\n    which is 1129 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1132. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 392. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 657 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 3, 3, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    15 x 0 + 87 x 0 + 35 x 3 + 67 x 3 + 15 x 5\n    which is 381 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 392. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\n### 1) Analyze the Current Situation:\n\n- **Outside Offer Value**: 392\n\n- **Values of Items to Me**:\n  - Item 1: 15 per unit\n  - Item 2: 87 per unit\n  - Item 3: 35 per unit\n  - Item 4: 67 per unit\n  - Item 5: 15 per unit\n\n- **Total Pool of Items**:\n  - 2 units of item 1\n  - 0 units of item 2\n  - 3 units of item 3\n  - 3 units of item 4\n  - 5 units of item 5\n\n- **Discount Factor Influence**: Since this is round 1 and hence \\(r - 1 = 0\\), the discount factor doesn't reduce the current round's value for any accepted offer.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n\n- **Current Offer**: None\n\n- **Potential Counteroffers**:\n  - Let\u2019s evaluate the potential value if we keep various combinations:\n\n  To avoid \"Mistake 2\" (making offers worse than the outside offer), we need to calculate offers ensuring that my remaining value exceeds 392.\n\n  Below is a proposal in which I maintain as much value as possible but still ensure that the proposed division gives me a value better than the outside offer.\n  \n  Example Offer:\n  - Give Player 2:\n    - 0 units of item 1\n    - 0 units of item 2\n    - 0 units of item 3\n    - 2 units of item 4\n    - 5 units of item 5\n\n  My total value if this offer is accepted:\n  - Item 1: 2 \\(*\\) 15 = 30\n  - Item 2: 0 \\(*\\) 87 = 0\n  - Item 3: 3 \\(*\\) 35 = 105\n  - Item 4: 1 \\(*\\) 67 = 67\n  - Item 5: 0 \\(*\\) 15 = 0\n\n  **Total value**: 30 + 0 + 105 + 67 + 0 = 202\n  \n  The above offer value is lower than my outside offer of 392. Therefore, it's crucial to adjust my proposal to improve my value up to or exceeding 392 before considering proposing it. Let's modify it to propose keeping a more significant portion of higher-value items. \n\n  Revised Offer considering my outside offer:\n  - Offer Player 2:\n    - 0 units of item 1\n    - 0 units of item 2\n    - 0 units of item 3\n    - 0 units of item 4\n    - 5 units of item 5\n\n  My total value then:\n  - Item 1: 2 \\(*\\) 15 = 30\n  - Item 2: 0 \\(*\\) 87 = 0\n  - Item 3: 3 \\(*\\) 35 = 105\n  - Item 4: 3 \\(*\\) 67 = 201\n  - Item 5: 0 \\(*\\) 15 = 0\n\n  **Total Value**: 30 + 0 + 105 + 201 + 0 = 336\n  \n  Yet, this is still not above 392, next maximize my kept value:\n\n  Offer Player 2:\n  - 0 units of item 1\n  - 0 units of item 2\n  - 0 units of item 3\n  - 0 units of item 4\n  - 3 units of item 5\n  \nMy total value then:\n- Item 1: 2 * 15 = 30\n- Item 2: 0 * 87 = 0\n- Item 3: 3 * 35 = 105\n- Item 4: 3 * 67 = 201\n- Item 5: 2 * 15 = 30\n\n**Total value**: 30 + 0 + 105 + 201 + 30 = 366\n\n\n### 3) Decision:\nSince none of the calculated values for any offer exceeds the outside offer of 392, sticking to a counteroffer that results in a more beneficial value seems not feasible for Round 1.

This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 3, 3, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    15 x 0 + 87 x 0 + 35 x 3 + 67 x 3 + 15 x 5\n    which is 381 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 392. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 1, 0, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Let's analyze the situation step-by-step in order to make a well-informed decision.\n\n1. **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - **Outside offer value:** My outside offer value is 392.\n   - **Values of the items involved:** \n     - Item 1: 15\n     - Item 2: 87\n     - Item 3: 35\n     - Item 4: 67\n     - Item 5: 15\n   - **Total pool of items:**\n     - Item 1: 2 units\n     - Item 2: 0 units\n     - Item 3: 3 units\n     - Item 4: 3 units\n     - Item 5: 5 units\n   - **Discount factor:** The discount rate is 0.98. This implies that the value of any received offer will be reduced by the discount factor depending on the round. In round 2, this factor does not apply, but will apply if the negotiation extends to round 3.\n\n2. **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** [0, 0, 0, 1, 2]\n     - My value if I accept:\n       - 0 units of Item 1 = 0 \u00d7 15 = 0\n       - 0 units of Item 2 = 0 \u00d7 87 = 0\n       - 0 units of Item 3 = 0 \u00d7 35 = 0\n       - 1 unit of Item 4 = 1 \u00d7 67 = 67\n       - 2 units of Item 5 = 2 \u00d7 15 = 30\n       - Total value = 67 + 30 = 97\n   - **Comparison with my outside offer:** 97 is significantly less than my outside offer of 392. Hence, accepting the current offer is not advantageous.\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** I need to propose an offer that gives me more than 392 in value. Let's consider keeping [2, 0, 3, 2, 3] (which gives Player 2 [0, 0, 0, 1, 2]) to achieve this:\n     - My value if I propose this:\n       - 2 units of Item 1 = 2 \u00d7 15 = 30\n       - 0 units of Item 2 = 0 \u00d7 87 = 0\n       - 3 units of Item 3 = 3 \u00d7 35 = 105\n       - 2 units of Item 4 = 2 \u00d7 67 = 134\n       - 3 units of Item 5 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45\n       - Total value = 30 + 0 + 105 + 134 + 45 = 314\n\n   However, I've made a mistake in the calculation of a proposed offer because this is still less than my outside offer of 392. Let's further analyze potential divisions.\n\nConsider proposing [1, 0, 0, 2, 4] (which gives Player 2 [1, 0, 3, 1, 1]):\n   - My value if I propose this:\n     - 1 unit of Item 1 = 1 \u00d7 15 = 15\n     - 0 units of Item 2 = 0 \u00d7 87 = 0\n     - 0 units of Item 3 = 0 \u00d7 35 = 0\n     - 2 units of Item 4 = 2 \u00d7 67 = 134\n     - 4 units of Item 5 = 4 \u00d7 15 = 60\n     - Total value = 15 + 0 + 0 + 134 + 60 = 209\n\nClearly, none of these combinations yield a value of 392 or more for me. I need to ensure the proposed counteroffer is better.\n\n3. **Make a decision:**\n   - **Accept the current offer?** No, as it results in a lower value than the outside offer.\n   - **Walk away?** This is an option but might attempt further negotiation.\n   - **Propose a specific counteroffer?** I should aim for a scenario where my value surpasses my outside offer of 392. Let's ensure this while going for another reasonable approach:\n\nBefore finalizing, we test keeping [2, 0, 2, 2, 1]: \n   - My value if I keep this:\n     - 2 units of Item 1 = 2 \u00d7 15 = 30\n     - 0 units of Item 2 = 0 \u00d7 87 = 0\n     - 2 units of Item 3 = 2 \u00d7 35 = 70\n     - 2 units of Item 4 = 2 \u00d7 67 = 134\n     - 1 unit of Item 5 = 1 \u00d7 15 = 15\n     - Total value = 30 + 0 + 70 + 134 + 15 = 249\n\nHowever, this still does not satisfy my requirements. Hence, after a careful analysis and no feasible offer reaching 392, opting to WALK is the most prudent approach.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 228. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 777 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 0, 4, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    97 x 2 + 68 x 0 + 69 x 0 + 1 x 4 + 24 x 1\n    which is 222 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 228. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 2, 3, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 2, 3, 4]\n\n    What is your action?

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 2, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    85 x 0 + 51 x 1 + 38 x 2 + 18 x 1 + 78 x 0\n    which is 145 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 147. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 6, 3, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 6, 3, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "I need to analyze this offer and determine my best action. Let's break this down systematically.\n\n## 1) Analyze the current situation\n- My outside offer value: 147\n- My private values: 85 for item 1, 51 for item 2, 38 for item 3, 18 for item 4, 78 for item 5\n- Total pool: 1 unit of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 8 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5\n- Discount factor: 0.98 (each round reduces value by 2%)\n- We are in round 1, so no discount applies yet\n\n## 2) Assess the value of the current offer\n\nCurrent offer to me is [0, 6, 3, 1, 0], which means I would get:\n- 0 units of item 1: 0 \u00d7 85 = 0\n- 6 units of item 2: 6 \u00d7 51 = 306\n- 3 units of item 3: 3 \u00d7 38 = 114\n- 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 18 = 18\n- 0 units of item 5: 0 \u00d7 78 = 0\n\nTotal value to me: 0 + 306 + 114 + 18 + 0 = 438\n\nThis means Player 1 would keep:\n- 1 unit of item 1\n- 0 units of item 2\n- 5 units of item 3\n- 1 unit of item 4\n- 4 units of item 5\n\nSince 438 > 147 (my outside offer), this offer is actually quite good for me.\n\n## 3) Consider a potential counteroffer\n\nPlayer 1's offer suggests they value item 1 and item 5 highly (keeping all units) and don't value item 2 much (giving me all units). I should consider this in my counteroffer.\n\nSince item 2 is very valuable to me (51 per unit) and Player 1 appears to not value it much, I should try to keep all of those units. For item 5, which is also valuable to me (78 per unit), Player 1 wants to keep all units, suggesting they also value it highly.\n\nLet me consider a counteroffer where I keep the items most valuable to me while trying to satisfy Player 1's apparent preferences:\n\nIf I offer Player 1 [1, 0, 5, 1, 2], I would keep:\n- 0 units of item 1: 0 \u00d7 85 = 0\n- 6 units of item 2: 6 \u00d7 51 = 306\n- 3 units of item 3: 3 \u00d7 38 = 114\n- 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 18 = 18\n- 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 78 = 156\n\nTotal value to me: 0 + 306 + 114 + 18 + 156 = 594\n\nThis is better than both the current offer (438) and my outside offer (147).\n\n## 4) Decision\n\nPlayer 1's offer is already quite good for me (438 > 147), but my potential counteroffer would be even better (594 > 438). Given that we're in round 1 and have two more rounds of negotiation possible, I believe it's worth making a counteroffer to try to improve my position.\n\nI'll offer Player 1 [1, 0, 5, 1, 2], which gives them all of item 1 (which they seem to value), none of item 2 (which they don't seem to value), most of item 3, half of item 4, and half of item 5.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 5, 1, 2]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 537. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 879 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 6, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    86 x 0 + 72 x 0 + 47 x 6 + 5 x 1 + 83 x 3\n    which is 536 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 537. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 6, 3, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 5, 1, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 3, 1, 1]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 5, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 5, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To determine my action, let's analyze the current situation using the steps provided:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **My Outside Offer Value**: 537\n- **Values of the Items**: \n  - Item 1: 86\n  - Item 2: 72\n  - Item 3: 47\n  - Item 4: 5\n  - Item 5: 83\n  \n- **Total Pool of Items**: [1 unit of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 8 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5]\n\n- **Discount Factor Influence**: In round 3, the discount factor does not affect future offers, as the game will end after this round. Therefore, accepting an offer now will provide immediate value without discounts applied to future rounds.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer Value**: The current offer on the table gives me [1, 1, 5, 1, 2] items.\n  - Value of item 1: 1 \u00d7 86 = 86\n  - Value of item 2: 1 \u00d7 72 = 72\n  - Value of item 3: 5 \u00d7 47 = 235\n  - Value of item 4: 1 \u00d7 5 = 5\n  - Value of item 5: 2 \u00d7 83 = 166\n  - Total current offer value: 86 + 72 + 235 + 5 + 166 = 564\n\n- **Comparison to Outside Offer**: 564 (current offer value) is greater than 537 (my outside offer).\n\n- **Potential Counteroffer**: I need to propose a division that gives me more than 564, which is higher than the current offer value. However, since it is the last round, a counteroffer might not be a strategic move, as the final negotiation outcome depends on Player 2's choice.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision Based on the Analysis\n\nGiven that:\n\n- The current offer's value (564) is higher than my outside offer value (537).\n- It is the last round, so Player 2's choice will be pivotal over proposing a new division.\n- Counteroffering might risk the potential value I'm receiving now due to this being the final round.\n\nBased on this analysis, the best course of action is to:\n\n- **ACCEPT** the current offer, as it provides a value greater than my outside offer, and proposing a counteroffer could be risky given there is no subsequent negotiation round.\n\nTherefore, my action is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 2, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    62 x 0 + 33 x 1 + 7 x 2 + 12 x 0 + 42 x 2\n    which is 131 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 132. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 5, 3, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 5, 3, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "I need to carefully analyze the current offer and determine my best action.\n\n## Step 1: Analyze my situation\n\n- My outside offer value: 132\n- My item values: \n  - Item 1: 62 per unit\n  - Item 2: 33 per unit  \n  - Item 3: 7 per unit\n  - Item 4: 12 per unit\n  - Item 5: 42 per unit\n- Total pool: 4 units of item 1, 8 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5\n- Current round: 2, discount factor: 0.98\n\n## Step 2: Assess the current offer\n\nPlayer 1 is offering me: [1, 3, 3, 3, 0]\nThis means I would get:\n- 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 62 = 62\n- 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99\n- 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21\n- 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36\n- 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 42 = 0\n\nTotal value for me: 62 + 99 + 21 + 36 + 0 = 218\nWith discount factor (round 2): 218 \u00d7 0.98 = 213.64\n\nThis is significantly better than my outside offer of 132.\n\n## Step 3: Consider potential counteroffers\n\nMy previous counteroffer was [1, 4, 3, 2, 0], meaning I wanted to keep 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n\nLooking at how Player 1's offers have evolved:\n- They initially offered me [2, 5, 3, 1, 0]\n- Now they're offering [1, 3, 3, 3, 0]\n\nThey're consistently offering me all of item 3, suggesting they don't value it much. They're also consistently offering me none of item 5, suggesting they value it highly. They've reduced their offer of item 1 (which I value highly) and item 2, but increased item 4.\n\nI could make a counteroffer, but the current offer is already quite good for me. If I push too hard, Player 1 might walk away in the final round, leaving me with only my outside offer.\n\n## Step 4: Decision\n\nThe current offer gives me a value of 213.64, which is substantially higher than my outside offer of 132. Making another counteroffer risks the negotiation failing in the next round.\n\nGiven that:\n1. The current offer is well above my outside offer\n2. We're in round 2 of 3, meaning one more counteroffer could end the negotiation\n3. The offered items align reasonably well with my values\n\nI will accept the current offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1000. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 774 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 0, 6, 0, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    99 x 3 + 6 x 0 + 91 x 6 + 10 x 0 + 52 x 3\n    which is 999 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1000. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 551. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 546 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 3, 4, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    34 x 5 + 8 x 3 + 26 x 4 + 45 x 1 + 69 x 3\n    which is 550 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 551. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To make a well-informed decision, let's proceed with a step-by-step evaluation.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 551.\n- **Values of the Items Involved:**\n  - Item 1: 34 per unit\n  - Item 2: 8 per unit\n  - Item 3: 26 per unit\n  - Item 4: 45 per unit\n  - Item 5: 69 per unit\n- **Total Pool of Items:**\n  - 8 units of item 1\n  - 3 units of item 2\n  - 4 units of item 3\n  - 1 unit of item 4\n  - 3 units of item 5\n- **Discount Factor:** The discount factor is 0.98. It influences the value as negotiation progresses to additional rounds by multiplying the outcome value by \\( \\gamma^{(r-1)} \\), where \\( r \\) is the round number. Since this is round 1, the discount factor doesn't change the current evaluation.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer:** There is no current offer to evaluate.\n- **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to determine a division of items that will give me a total value greater than my outside offer of 551. \n\nTo avoid mistake 2 (making an offer worse for me than my outside offer), let's draft an offer where the value of items I keep is above 551.\n\nLet's consider keeping:\n\n- 8 units of item 1: \\( 8 \\times 34 = 272 \\)\n- 3 units of item 2: \\( 3 \\times 8 = 24 \\)\n- 4 units of item 3: \\( 4 \\times 26 = 104 \\)\n- 1 unit of item 4: \\( 1 \\times 45 = 45 \\)\n- 2 units of item 5: \\( 2 \\times 69 = 138 \\)\n\nTotal value if I keep these units: \\( 272 + 24 + 104 + 45 + 138 = 583 \\)\n\nI would offer:\n\n- 0 units of item 1\n- 0 units of item 2\n- 0 units of item 3\n- 0 units of item 4\n- 1 unit of item 5\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nBased on these calculations, by keeping most items and offering low-value units to Player 2, the total value of items I retain exceeds my outside offer. Hence, avoiding mistake 2 and mistake 3, I will propose a counteroffer to Player 2.\n\nLet's submit the action:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]}\n```",

Since item 4 has the highest value for me (91), I want to keep it. Items 5 and 2 are also valuable to me.\n\nConsidering Player 1's initial offer, they seem to value item 5 somewhat. Let me try offering some of item 1 (my lowest value item) and a bit of items 2 and 3.\n\nLet's try offering Player 1: [3, 1, 1, 0, 1]\n\nThis means I keep: [5, 2, 3, 1, 2]\n\n**Value of this to me:**\n(5 \u00d7 30) + (2 \u00d7 46) + (3 \u00d7 48) + (1 \u00d7 91) + (2 \u00d7 59) = 150 + 92 + 144 + 91 + 118 = 595\n\nThis is much less than my outside offer of 808, so this offer would be a mistake (Mistake 2).\n\nLet me try a more conservative offer: [2, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n\nThis means I keep: [6, 3, 4, 1, 2]\n\n**Value of this to me:**\n(6 \u00d7 30) + (3 \u00d7 46) + (4 \u00d7 48) + (1 \u00d7 91) + (2 \u00d7 59) = 180 + 138 + 192 + 91 + 118 = 719\n\nStill less than my outside offer.\n\nLet's try: [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nThis means I keep: [7, 3, 4, 1, 3]\n\n**Value of this to me:**\n(7 \u00d7 30) + (3 \u00d7 46) + (4 \u00d7 48) + (1 \u00d7 91) + (3 \u00d7 59) = 210 + 138 + 192 + 91 + 177 = 808\n\nThis exactly matches my outside offer value.\n\nLet me try giving up just one more item 1 to make this more acceptable for Player 1:\nIf I offer [2, 0, 0, 0, 0], I keep [6, 3, 4, 1, 3]\n\n**Value of this to me:**\n(6 \u00d7 30) + (3 \u00d7 46) + (4 \u00d7 48) + (1 \u00d7 91) + (3 \u00d7 59) = 180 + 138 + 192 + 91 + 177 = 778\n\nThis is less than my outside offer, but not by much.

                    "response": "To decide on the best course of action, let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer value is 551.\n- **Values of Items**:\n  - Item 1: 34\n  - Item 2: 8\n  - Item 3: 26\n  - Item 4: 45\n  - Item 5: 69\n- **Total Pool of Items**:\n  - 8 units of item 1\n  - 3 units of item 2\n  - 4 units of item 3\n  - 1 unit of item 4\n  - 3 units of item 5\n- **Discount Factor Influence**: The discount factor of 0.98 means that any deal concluded in the second round is slightly less valuable than in the first round due to time delay. This factor becomes relevant if the negotiation extends to the third round.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer on the Table**: [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  - Value of the current offer to me:\n    - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 34 = 34\n  - Total value = 34, which is far less than my outside offer of 551.\n\n- **Evaluate Counteroffers**:\n  - To surpass my outside offer of 551 effectively, I must ensure the total value of kept items is greater than 551.\n  - An example counteroffer where I keep as many high-value items as possible would be keeping [8, 3, 0, 0, 0] items:\n    - 8 units of item 1 = 8 \u00d7 34 = 272\n    - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24\n    - Total = 296 (just an example, does not surpass 551)\n  - Let's reassess with valuable items:\n    - Keep [6, 3, 4, 1, 3] and offer [2, 0, 0, 0, 0]:\n      - 6 \u00d7 34 + 3 \u00d7 8 + 4 \u00d7 26 + 1 \u00d7 45 + 3 \u00d7 69\n      - Total value for me = 204 + 24 + 104 + 45 + 207 = 584\n    \n    My counteroffer [2, 0, 0, 0, 0] keeps 6 units of item 1, 3 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 3 of item 5 for me.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\n- The current offer from Player 2 is worth only 34, which is drastically lower than my outside offer value of 551.\n- Walking away with my outside offer guarantees me a value of 551.\n- If I walk away now, I secure 551.\n- Since making a counteroffer of keeping [2, 0, 0, 0, 0] results in a higher value than my outside offer, I proceed with the counteroffer.\n\nTherefore, as the current offer is not appealing and I can propose a better outcome through a counteroffer, my decision is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 808. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 822 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [8, 2, 4, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    30 x 8 + 46 x 2 + 48 x 4 + 91 x 1 + 59 x 3\n    which is 792 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 808. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

I need to make a counteroffer that:\n- Gives me value at least equal to my outside offer\n- Makes a reasonable concession to Player 1\n- Avoids the five mistakes mentioned\n\nLet me calculate a reasonable counteroffer:\n- If I keep 7 units of item 1 (give 1), all of item 2, all of item 3, all of item 4, and 2 units of item 5 (give 1):\n  - Value: 7\u00d730 + 3\u00d746 + 4\u00d748 + 1\u00d791 + 2\u00d759 = 210 + 138 + 192 + 91 + 118 = 749\n  - This is below my outside offer of 808.\n\n- If I keep 8 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 2 units of item 5 (give 1):\n  - Value: 8\u00d730 + 3\u00d746 + 4\u00d748 + 1\u00d791 + 2\u00d759 = 240 + 138 + 192 + 91 + 118 = 779\n  - Still below my outside offer.\n\n- If I keep 8 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 3 units of item 5:\n  - Value: 8\u00d730 + 3\u00d746 + 4\u00d748 + 1\u00d791 + 3\u00d759 = 240 + 138 + 192 + 91 + 177 = 838\n  - This exceeds my outside offer.\n\nBased on this analysis, I need to keep most of the items to reach my outside offer value. Given that we're already in round 2 and Player 1 has made minimal concessions, I'll try one more counteroffer that signals I need most items to reach my reservation value.\n\nI'll offer Player 1 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n\nThis would leave me with:\n- Value: 8\u00d730 + 3\u00d746 + 3\u00d748 + 1\u00d791 + 3\u00d759 = 240 + 138 + 144 + 91 + 177 = 790\n- With discount: 790 \u00d7 0.98 = 774.2\n\nThis is still below my outside offer, but it's a signal to Player 1 that I need most items.

A potential offer could be to keep most items:\n\n- Let's propose to keep:\n  - 7 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n\nCalculate the value for me:\n\n- Item 1: \\( 34 \\times 7 = 238 \\)\n- Item 2: \\( 8 \\times 3 = 24 \\)\n- Item 3: \\( 26 \\times 3 = 78 \\)\n- Item 4: \\( 45 \\times 1 = 45 \\)\n- Item 5: \\( 69 \\times 3 = 207 \\)\n\nTotal Value = 238 + 24 + 78 + 45 + 207 = 592\n\n- Since 592 is greater than my outside offer of 551, this is an acceptable counteroffer for me.\n\nTherefore, my action is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]}\n```\n\nThis offer leaves me with 7 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [8, 2, 4, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    30 x 8 + 46 x 2 + 48 x 4 + 91 x 1 + 59 x 3\n    which is 792 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 808. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 5, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    47 x 0 + 42 x 0 + 35 x 5 + 99 x 1 + 1 x 0\n    which is 274 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 275. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 11. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 663 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 0, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    3 x 3 + 48 x 0 + 80 x 0 + 20 x 0 + 70 x 0\n    which is 9 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 11. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

This means:\n- For item 1: I get 0 units = 0 value\n- For item 2: I get 1 unit = 48 value\n- For item 3: I get 0 units = 0 value\n- For item 4: I get 1 unit = 20 value\n- For item 5: I get 1 unit = 70 value\n- Total value to me = 48 + 20 + 70 = 138\n\nThis is significantly higher than my outside offer of 11.\n\nLooking at what this means about Player 1's offer:\n- They want all of item 1 (3 units)\n- They want none of item 2 (0 units)\n- They want all of item 3 (3 units)\n- They want none of item 4 (0 units)\n- They want half of item 5 (1 unit)\n\nThis suggests Player 1 values items 1 and 3 highly, and doesn't value items 2 and 4 much.\n\n## 3) Decision Analysis:\n\nLet me consider a counteroffer that might be better for me while still being acceptable to Player 1. Since Player 1 seems to value items 1 and 3, I could try to keep more of item 5 while offering them more of items 1 and 3.\n\nPotential counteroffer: Give Player 1 [3, 0, 2, 0, 0]\nThis means I keep:\n- Item 1: 0 units = 0 value\n- Item 2: 1 unit = 48 value\n- Item 3: 1 unit = 80 value\n- Item 4: 1 unit = 20 value\n- Item 5: 2 units = 140 value\n- Total value to me = 48 + 80 + 20 + 140 = 288\n\nThis counteroffer would give me 288 value, which is much better than my outside offer of 11 and better than Player 1's current offer of 138 value.\n\nHowever, I should also consider that Player 1 might reject this offer, which would mean another round with discounting. Given the large gap between my outside offer (11) and the current offer (138), it seems very advantageous to try to negotiate for an even better deal.\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that gives Player 1 the items they seem to value while keeping the items I value most:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 0, 2, 0, 0]}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 11. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 663 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 0, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    3 x 3 + 48 x 0 + 80 x 0 + 20 x 0 + 70 x 0\n    which is 9 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 11. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 0, 2, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "I need to analyze this negotiation situation carefully to make the best decision.\n\n### 1) Current Situation Analysis:\n- My outside offer value: 11\n- My item values: Item 1 (3), Item 2 (48), Item 3 (80), Item 4 (20), Item 5 (70)\n- Total pool: 3 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 2 units of item 5\n- Discount factor: 0.98 (we're in round 2, so any deal will be worth 0.98 of its original value)\n\n### 2) Evaluate the Current Offer:\nPlayer 1 is offering me: [0, 1, 0, 1, 1]\nValue to me:\n- 0 units of item 1 = 0\n- 1 unit of item 2 = 48\n- 0 units of item 3 = 0\n- 1 unit of item 4 = 20\n- 1 unit of item 5 = 70\nTotal value = 138\n\nWith discount factor: 138 \u00d7 0.98 = 135.24, which is much higher than my outside offer of 11.\n\n### 3) Evaluate My Previous Counteroffer:\nI previously offered [3, 0, 2, 0, 0] to Player 1, meaning I would keep:\n- 0 units of item 1 = 0\n- 1 unit of item 2 = 48\n- 1 unit of item 3 = 80\n- 1 unit of item 4 = 20\n- 2 units of item 5 = 140\nValue to me = 288\n\n### 4) Decision Making:\nPlayer 1's offer gives me 135.24 value (with discount), which is:\n- Much higher than my outside offer (11)\n- Lower than what I would get from my previous counteroffer (288)\n\nSince Player 1 has repeated their original offer, I should evaluate if I can improve my position with another counteroffer. I want to prioritize items 3 and 5, which have high value to me.\n\nLet me try a new counteroffer where I keep most of items 3 and 5, while giving Player 1 more of item 1 which has low value to me:\n\nPotential counteroffer [3, 0, 1, 1, 0] (giving Player 1 all of item 1, none of item 2, 2 units of item 3, none of item 4, 2 units of item 5)\n\nValue to me:\n- 0 units of item 1 = 0\n- 1 unit of item 2 = 48\n- 1 unit of item 3 = 80\n- 0 units of item 4 = 0\n- 0 units of item 5 = 0\nTotal value = 128\n\nThis is worse than accepting their current offer (138)! Let me try again.\n\nBetter counteroffer [2, 0, 1, 0, 0] (giving Player 1 1 unit of item 1, none of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 2 units of item 5)\n\nValue to me:\n- 2 units of item 1 = 6\n- 1 unit of item 2 = 48\n- 1 unit of item 3 = 80\n- 0 units of item 4 = 0\n- 0 units of item 5 = 0\nTotal value = 134\n\nThis is still worse than accepting!\n\nSince we're in round 2 (of 3) and Player 1 has shown no willingness to change their offer, and their current offer is significantly better than my outside option, I should accept this offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",
