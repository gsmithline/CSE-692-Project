If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

It means that accepting an offer in later rounds is slightly less valuable than accepting the same offer in earlier rounds.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am offered [1, 2, 6, 1, 1]. This means I get 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5. The value of this offer is: (1 * 35) + (2 * 85) + (6 * 95) + (1 * 14) + (1 * 85) = 35 + 170 + 570 + 14 + 85 = 874.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1516. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 942 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 2, 8, 1, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    35 x 4 + 85 x 2 + 95 x 8 + 14 x 1 + 85 x 5\n    which is 1509 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1516. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 6, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 3, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 8, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 8, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1.  **Current Situation:**\n\n    *   My outside offer value: 1516\n    *   My item values: item 1 = 35, item 2 = 85, item 3 = 95, item 4 = 14, item 5 = 85\n    *   Total items: item 1 = 4, item 2 = 2, item 3 = 8, item 4 = 5, item 5 = 5\n    *   Discount factor: gamma = 0.98\n\n2.  **Assess the value of the current offer:**\n\n    *   Current offer (to me): \\[1, 2, 8, 1, 2]\n    *   This means I receive: 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 8 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 2 units of item 5.\n    *   Value of this offer to me: (1 \\* 35) + (2 \\* 85) + (8 \\* 95) + (1 \\* 14) + (2 \\* 85) = 35 + 170 + 760 + 14 + 170 = 1149\n    *   Discounted value of the offer in round 2: 1149 \\* (0.98)^(2-1) = 1149 \\* 0.98 = 1126.02\n\n    *   Since 1126.02 < 1516, accepting the current offer is worse than my outside offer. Mistake 4.\n\n3.  **Consider a potential counteroffer:**\n    * First, I will determine the amounts I need to keep to reach my outside offer value. The values for each item are relatively high, especially items 2, 3 and 5.\n    Let's consider keeping: item 1 = 4, item 2 = 2, item 3 = 8, item 4 = 0, item 5 = 5\n    This would give me: (4 * 35) + (2 * 85) + (8 * 95) + (0 * 14) + (5 * 85) = 140 + 170 + 760 + 0 + 425 = 1495\n    This is a bit below my outside offer.\n    Let's consider keeping: item 1 = 4, item 2 = 2, item 3 = 8, item 4 = 1, item 5 = 5\n    This would give me: (4 * 35) + (2 * 85) + (8 * 95) + (1 * 14) + (5 * 85) = 140 + 170 + 760 + 14 + 425 = 1509\n    This is still slightly below my outside offer.\n    Let's consider keeping: item 1 = 4, item 2 = 2, item 3 = 8, item 4 = 2, item 5 = 5\n    This would give me: (4 * 35) + (2 * 85) + (8 * 95) + (2 * 14) + (5 * 85) = 140 + 170 + 760 + 28 + 425 = 1523\n    So, this is a possible offer.\n\n    This means I offer Player 1: item 1 = 0, item 2 = 0, item 3 = 0, item 4 = 3, item 5 = 0\n\n    Value to me would be 1523, so discounted value is 1523 * 0.98 = 1492.54. This is lower than my outside offer.\n    However, I only have one round to propose a counteroffer, so let's examine the value of WALKing away:\n\n    Value of WALKing away: 1516 * (0.98) = 1485.68\n\n    Because the outside offer is discounted, I will make the offer that provides me with a undiscounted value exceeding 1516.\n\n4.  **Decision:**\nSince accepting the offer is worse than my outside offer, and the total value of the items I keep has to exceed 1516, I will make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 3, 0]}\n```",

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 6, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 3, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 8, 1, 2]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 3, 0]\nRound 3: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 2, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 2, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and decide on the best action.\n\n1. **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n   - My outside offer value is 1516.\n   - My item values are: Item 1 = 35, Item 2 = 85, Item 3 = 95, Item 4 = 14, Item 5 = 85.\n   - Total items: 4 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 8 of item 3, 5 of item 4, 5 of item 5.\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.98.  Since this is round 3, the discount factor will not matter since if I make a counteroffer it will be treated as a walk.\n\n2. **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer:** I receive [0, 0, 2, 1, 1]. This means Player 1 gets [4, 2, 6, 4, 4].\n      - My value: (0 * 35) + (0 * 85) + (2 * 95) + (1 * 14) + (1 * 85) = 0 + 0 + 190 + 14 + 85 = 289.\n      - This is significantly less than my outside offer of 1516.\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** Let's consider a few options, aiming to get a value above 1516:\n\n     - **Keep everything:** My value would be: (4 * 35) + (2 * 85) + (8 * 95) + (5 * 14) + (5 * 85) = 140 + 170 + 760 + 70 + 425 = 1565.\n       - This is barely better than my outside offer but I would give the other player [0,0,0,0,0].\n     - **Give player 1 [0, 0, 2, 1, 1]:** As calculated above my value is 289 which is less than the outside offer.\n     - **Give player 1 [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]:** Then I would get [3, 2, 8, 5, 5]. Value is (3*35) + (2*85) + (8*95) + (5*14) + (5*85) = 105 + 170 + 760 + 70 + 425 = 1530.\n      - This is better than my outside offer.\n     - **Give player 1 [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]:** Then I would get [4, 1, 8, 5, 5]. Value is (4*35) + (1*85) + (8*95) + (5*14) + (5*85) = 140 + 85 + 760 + 70 + 425 = 1480.\n      - This is worse than my outside offer.\n     - **Give player 1 [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]:** Then I would get [4, 2, 7, 5, 5]. Value is (4*35) + (2*85) + (7*95) + (5*14) + (5*85) = 140 + 170 + 665 + 70 + 425 = 1470.\n      - This is worse than my outside offer.\n\n3. **Make a decision:**\n\n   - The current offer is terrible (289 < 1516).\n   - I can walk and get 1516.\n   - I can make a counteroffer to try and get more than 1516.\n\n   Since this is the last round, any counteroffer is treated as a walk. So I should either accept the current offer or walk. Since the current offer (289) is much less than my outside offer (1516) I should walk.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 825. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 825. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 738 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 5, 0, 1, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    9 x 3 + 68 x 5 + 52 x 0 + 49 x 1 + 68 x 6\n    which is 824 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 825. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

This means accepting an offer later is slightly less valuable than accepting it now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** [2, 2, 0, 2, 2] (what I receive)\n    *   Value of current offer: (2 * 39) + (2 * 3) + (0 * 36) + (2 * 31) + (2 * 66) = 78 + 6 + 0 + 62 + 132 = 278\n    *   Since 278 < 652, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away and taking my outside offer.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**  I need to find an offer where what I keep is worth more than 652. Let's start by offering a \"fair\" split and adjust from there. A fair split might be dividing each item roughly in half. Let's aim for an offer where I keep at least half of each item.\n\n    I have items [4, 7, 2, 5, 6].\n    This means I can offer [2, 3, 1, 2, 3] or [2, 4, 1, 3, 3]. Let's examine some of these.

That offer would result in the following value:\n    Value = 4 * 39 + 7 * 3 + 2 * 36 + 5 * 31 + 6 * 66 = 156 + 21 + 72 + 155 + 396 = 800\n    Since 800 > 652, this offer is worthwhile.\n\n    I can consider different counteroffers. Let's aim to offer Player 1 items they might value less, while keeping the items I value more. Without knowing their values, this is a guessing game, but I can make educated guesses based on their current offer.\n\n    Since they offered me 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5, this suggests they might value item 3 more highly and value the other items less highly than me.\n\n    Let's try a counteroffer where I give them a lot of item 2 and item 4.\n    Counteroffer: [0, 5, 0, 3, 0]\n    This means I keep [4, 2, 2, 2, 6]\n    Value: 4 * 39 + 2 * 3 + 2 * 36 + 2 * 31 + 6 * 66 = 156 + 6 + 72 + 62 + 396 = 692.\n    Since 692 > 652, this is a good counteroffer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is terrible. Walking away would get me 652. A counteroffer of [0, 5, 0, 3, 0] would leave me with a value of 692. This is better than walking away, and better than the other offers.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 5, 0, 3, 0]}\n```",

Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 5, 0, 1, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    9 x 3 + 68 x 5 + 52 x 0 + 49 x 1 + 68 x 6\n    which is 824 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 825. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 0, 2, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 5, 0, 3, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 0, 2, 1]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [0, 7, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 7, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Based on Player 2's offers, they seem to value items 1, 3, 4, and 5 more than item 2.\n   \n   If I try to keep most of the high-value items for myself:\n   Keeping [4, 0, 2, 5, 6] (offering [0, 7, 0, 0, 0] to Player 2):\n   - 4 units of item 1: 4 \u00d7 9 = 36\n   - 0 units of item 2: 0 \u00d7 68 = 0\n   - 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 52 = 104\n   - 5 units of item 4: 5 \u00d7 49 = 245\n   - 6 units of item 5: 6 \u00d7 68 = 408\n   \n   Total value = 793\n   Discounted value = 793 \u00d7 0.9604 = 761.60\n\n   This is less than my outside offer of 825.\n\n4) Decision:\n   - The current offer's value (457.15) is less than my outside offer (825)\n   - My potential counteroffer (761.60) is also less than my outside offer (825)\n   - Due to the discount factor in this final round, it's unlikely I can structure a deal that exceeds my outside offer\n\nTherefore, the rational choice is to WALK away and take my outside offer of 825, as it provides more value than either accepting the current offer or making a counteroffer.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 3, 2, 4, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    49 x 4 + 39 x 3 + 29 x 2 + 24 x 4 + 39 x 2\n    which is 545 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 546. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Current Situation Analysis:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 546\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 49, Item 2: 39, Item 3: 29, Item 4: 24, Item 5: 39\n*   **Total items:** Item 1: 4, Item 2: 3, Item 3: 4, Item 4: 4, Item 5: 2\n*   **Discount factor:** 0.98. This means that an offer accepted in a later round is worth slightly less than an offer accepted now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I receive [3, 2, 1, 0, 0]. This means Player 1 gets 3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3 and 0 units of item 4 and 0 units of item 5.  Therefore, I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 4 - 3 = 1 unit\n    *   Item 2: 3 - 2 = 1 unit\n    *   Item 3: 4 - 1 = 3 units\n    *   Item 4: 4 - 0 = 4 units\n    *   Item 5: 2 - 0 = 2 units\n\n    My value for this offer: (1 * 49) + (1 * 39) + (3 * 29) + (4 * 24) + (2 * 39) = 49 + 39 + 87 + 96 + 78 = 349.\n    Since 349 < 546, accepting this offer would be worse than walking away.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to make an offer that gives me a value greater than 546. Let's start by aiming for a minimal improvement over my outside offer.\n\n    Here's an example:\n    Keep: [4, 3, 3, 4, 2] -> offer [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n    Value = (4 * 49) + (3 * 39) + (3 * 29) + (4 * 24) + (2 * 39) = 196 + 117 + 87 + 96 + 78 = 574.\n    This is greater than my outside offer. It might be too greedy and will be probably rejected, however, let's consider offering Player 1 one unit of item 3, so I get 574.\n    Let's consider keeping [3, 2, 3, 4, 2]. This implies offering [1, 1, 1, 0, 0].\n    My value is (3*49) + (2*39) + (3*29) + (4*24) + (2*39) = 147 + 78 + 87 + 96 + 78 = 486. This is much lower than my outside offer.\n    The goal is to find something closer to 546.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\nThe current offer is terrible. My previous offer was [1, 1, 2, 2, 1], which was rejected by Player 1. Player 1 is increasing the offer of item 2 which has a value of 39 for me.\n\nLet's try a different counteroffer that's somewhere between previous offers. Let's offer [2, 1, 1, 1, 0].\nThis means I keep [2, 2, 3, 3, 2].\nValue = (2 * 49) + (2 * 39) + (3 * 29) + (3 * 24) + (2 * 39) = 98 + 78 + 87 + 72 + 78 = 413.\nStill low.\n\nLet me try giving up only Item 3. Offer: [0, 0, 1, 0, 0] which means keeping [4, 3, 3, 4, 2]\nValue = 4*49 + 3*39 + 3*29 + 4*24 + 2*39 = 196 + 117 + 87 + 96 + 78 = 574.\n\nLet me try giving up only Item 4. Offer: [0, 0, 0, 1, 0] which means keeping [4, 3, 4, 3, 2]\nValue = 4*49 + 3*39 + 4*29 + 3*24 + 2*39 = 196 + 117 + 116 + 72 + 78 = 579.\n\nLet me try giving up only Item 5. Offer: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1] which means keeping [4, 3, 4, 4, 1]\nValue = 4*49 + 3*39 + 4*29 + 4*24 + 1*39 = 196 + 117 + 116 + 96 + 39 = 564. This is still above 546.\n\nOkay. Let's use the second from the end offer [0, 0, 0, 1, 0] because it is the most beneficial one.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]}\n```",

The discounted value of this offer (1006.50) is much better than my outside offer (775).\n\nFurthermore, this is the last round, so if I make a counteroffer, Player 2 can only accept, walk away, or make a counteroffer which would be treated as a walk. There's risk in making a counteroffer at this point, as Player 2 might walk away.\n\nSince the current offer is already very good for me and exceeds my outside offer by a significant margin, I should accept this offer rather than risk losing it.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 0, 2, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    48 x 1 + 25 x 0 + 82 x 0 + 37 x 2 + 31 x 0\n    which is 122 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 124. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Since I'm making the first offer, I'll start with an offer that's favorable to me while giving some value to Player 2.\n\nLooking at the values per unit, I can see that items 3, 4, and 5 are most valuable to me, while items 1 and 2 are less valuable. So I should keep most of the high-value items and offer more of the low-value items.\n\nIf I offer Player 2:\n- 7 units of item 1 (keeping 1 unit = 32 value to me)\n- 3 units of item 2 (keeping 1 unit = 23 value to me)\n- 0 units of item 3 (keeping 2 units = 180 value to me)\n- 1 unit of item 4 (keeping 4 units = 376 value to me)\n- 1 unit of item 5 (keeping 6 units = 540 value to me)\n\nMy total value would be: 32 + 23 + 180 + 376 + 540 = 1151\n\nThis is much better than my outside offer of 192, so this seems like a good starting point. I'm keeping most of my high-value items while giving Player 2 something to consider.\n\nStep 3: Decision\nI'll make a counteroffer of [7, 3, 0, 1, 1], which represents what I'm offering to Player 2.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 1, 4, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    38 x 0 + 25 x 2 + 54 x 1 + 62 x 4 + 47 x 2\n    which is 446 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 447. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 2, 4, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 2, 4, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 447\n*   My values for items: 38 for item 1, 25 for item 2, 54 for item 3, 62 for item 4, 47 for item 5.\n*   Total pool of items: 3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5.\n*   Discount factor: 0.98.  Since it is round 1, the discount factor will not have any influence in round 1\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   Current offer to me: [1, 0, 2, 4, 1]\n    This means Player 1 is offering me 1 unit of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n    My value if I accept this offer:\n    (1 * 38) + (0 * 25) + (2 * 54) + (4 * 62) + (1 * 47) = 38 + 0 + 108 + 248 + 47 = 441\n\n*   Comparing to my outside offer: The current offer is worth 441 to me, which is LESS than my outside offer of 447. Therefore, accepting would be Mistake 4.\n\n*   Potential counteroffers: I need to find an offer where I receive items that are worth more than 447 to me. Let's start by ensuring I get all of item 4 (which I value highly).\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince the current offer is worth less than my outside offer, I should not accept. I also should not walk away since it is only round 1 and there's still room for negotiation. I will construct a counteroffer. I need to find an offer better than 447.\n\nCurrent offer to me: [1, 0, 2, 4, 1]\nThis corresponds to Player 1 keeping: [2, 2, 5, 2, 3]\n\nMy items are: [3, 2, 7, 6, 4]\nValues are: [38, 25, 54, 62, 47]\nOutside offer: 447\n\nI need to keep enough items such that their value is more than 447.\n\nLet me try an offer where I keep 2 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 4 of item 4, 3 of item 5.

My calculation would be:\n(2 * 38) + (1 * 25) + (4 * 54) + (4 * 62) + (3 * 47) = 76 + 25 + 216 + 248 + 141 = 706\nThis is way above 447.\n\nNow let me try to give up 1 unit of item 4: offer to Player 1 is [1, 1, 3, 3, 1]. My calculation is:\n(2 * 38) + (1 * 25) + (4 * 54) + (3 * 62) + (3 * 47) = 76 + 25 + 216 + 186 + 141 = 644\nStill above 447.\n\nLet me try to give up 2 units of item 4: offer to Player 1 is [1, 1, 3, 4, 1]. My calculation is:\n(2 * 38) + (1 * 25) + (4 * 54) + (2 * 62) + (3 * 47) = 76 + 25 + 216 + 124 + 141 = 582\nStill above 447.\n\nLet me try to give up 3 units of item 4: offer to Player 1 is [1, 1, 3, 5, 1]. My calculation is:\n(2 * 38) + (1 * 25) + (4 * 54) + (1 * 62) + (3 * 47) = 76 + 25 + 216 + 62 + 141 = 520\nStill above 447.\n\nLet me try to give up 4 units of item 4: offer to Player 1 is [1, 1, 3, 6, 1]. My calculation is:\n(2 * 38) + (1 * 25) + (4 * 54) + (0 * 62) + (3 * 47) = 76 + 25 + 216 + 0 + 141 = 458\nStill above 447.\n\nLet me try to give up 5 units of item 4: offer to Player 1 is [1, 1, 3, 6, 1]. My calculation is:\n(2 * 38) + (1 * 25) + (4 * 54) + (0 * 62) + (3 * 47) = 76 + 25 + 216 + 0 + 141 = 458\nStill above 447.\n\nI will give them [1, 1, 3, 5, 1].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 3, 5, 1]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 2, 0, 3, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    31 x 1 + 11 x 2 + 2 x 0 + 1 x 3 + 82 x 4\n    which is 384 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 385. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 1, 4, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    59 x 0 + 84 x 3 + 77 x 1 + 65 x 4 + 23 x 6\n    which is 727 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 728. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "I'll analyze this negotiation step by step to determine my optimal action.\n\n### 1) Current Situation Analysis\n- **My outside offer value**: 728\n- **My item values**: \n  - Item 1: 59 per unit (3 units total)\n  - Item 2: 84 per unit (5 units total)\n  - Item 3: 77 per unit (6 units total)\n  - Item 4: 65 per unit (4 units total)\n  - Item 5: 23 per unit (8 units total)\n- **Total pool of items**: [3, 5, 6, 4, 8]\n- **Discount factor**: 0.98 (affects value in later rounds)\n\n### 2) Value Calculation\nFirst, I'll calculate the total maximum value if I kept all items:\n- Item 1: 3 \u00d7 59 = 177\n- Item 2: 5 \u00d7 84 = 420\n- Item 3: 6 \u00d7 77 = 462\n- Item 4: 4 \u00d7 65 = 260\n- Item 5: 8 \u00d7 23 = 184\n- Total maximum value: 1,503\n\nSince this is the first round, I need to make a strategic initial offer. I should try to maximize my value while giving enough to Player 2 to keep them interested.\n\nLooking at my values, I want to keep most of the high-value items (2 and 3) and can afford to give away more of the low-value items (especially 5).\n\nLet me consider an initial offer where I keep most high-value items:\n- Give 1 unit of item 1, keep 2: Value kept = 2 \u00d7 59 = 118\n- Give 1 unit of item 2, keep 4: Value kept = 4 \u00d7 84 = 336\n- Give 1 unit of item 3, keep 5: Value kept = 5 \u00d7 77 = 385\n- Give 1 unit of item 4, keep 3: Value kept = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195\n- Give 5 units of item 5, keep 3: Value kept = 3 \u00d7 23 = 69\n- Total value kept: 1,103\n\nThis gives me a value of 1,103, which is significantly better than my outside offer of 728.\n\n### 3) Decision Making\nSince this is the first round, I need to balance between making a strong opening position and leaving room for negotiation.\n\nMy offer of [1, 1, 1, 1, 5] to Player 2:\n- Gives a reasonable portion to Player 2\n- Keeps my high-value items mostly with me\n- Preserves a value (1,103) well above my outside offer\n- Leaves room for concessions in future rounds if needed\n\nThis is better than walking away immediately (which would give me 728), and it's a reasonable opening offer that avoids all five potential mistakes:\n- It's my first offer so Mistake 1 doesn't apply\n- The value to me (1,103) exceeds my outside offer (728), avoiding Mistake 2\n- I'm offering some of each item, avoiding Mistake 3\n- Mistakes 4 and 5 don't apply as I'm not accepting or walking away\n\nTherefore, my action is to make a counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 5]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1336. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 822 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action.\n\n1. **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** 1336\n*   **Item values:** Item 1 = 46, Item 2 = 88, Item 3 = 87, Item 4 = 17, Item 5 = 36\n*   **Total items:** Item 1 = 3, Item 2 = 5, Item 3 = 6, Item 4 = 4, Item 5 = 8\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.98. This means that accepting an offer in a later round is slightly less valuable than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2. **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 5]. This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 3 - 1 = 2\n    *   Item 2: 5 - 1 = 4\n    *   Item 3: 6 - 1 = 5\n    *   Item 4: 4 - 1 = 3\n    *   Item 5: 8 - 5 = 3\n\n    My value for this offer is:\n    2 * 46 + 4 * 88 + 5 * 87 + 3 * 17 + 3 * 36 = 92 + 352 + 435 + 51 + 108 = 1038\n\n    1038 < 1336.  The current offer is worse than my outside offer.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 1336. Since Player 1's offers might be based on their private values, I should consider offering them more of the items I value less and keeping more of the items I value highly.\n\n    Let's try an offer where I give Player 1 almost all of item 4 and item 5, and some of item 1, and not much of items 2 and 3. I can offer [1, 0, 0, 4, 8] to Player 1, which means I keep:\n\n    *   Item 1: 3 - 1 = 2\n    *   Item 2: 5 - 0 = 5\n    *   Item 3: 6 - 0 = 6\n    *   Item 4: 4 - 4 = 0\n    *   Item 5: 8 - 8 = 0\n\n    My value for this counteroffer is: 2 * 46 + 5 * 88 + 6 * 87 + 0 * 17 + 0 * 36 = 92 + 440 + 522 + 0 + 0 = 1054. \n    This is still less than my outside offer.\n\n    Let's try a counteroffer where I offer them more of Item 1 and keep all of Items 2 and 3. Offer: [3, 0, 0, 0, 0] to Player 1.\n    *   Item 1: 3 - 3 = 0\n    *   Item 2: 5 - 0 = 5\n    *   Item 3: 6 - 0 = 6\n    *   Item 4: 4 - 0 = 4\n    *   Item 5: 8 - 0 = 8\n\n    My value: 0 * 46 + 5 * 88 + 6 * 87 + 4 * 17 + 8 * 36 = 0 + 440 + 522 + 68 + 288 = 1318\n    Still less than my outside offer.\n\n    Let's try keeping all of Items 2 and 3 and most of Item 5. Offer [0, 0, 0, 4, 7] to Player 1.\n    *   Item 1: 3 - 0 = 3\n    *   Item 2: 5 - 0 = 5\n    *   Item 3: 6 - 0 = 6\n    *   Item 4: 4 - 4 = 0\n    *   Item 5: 8 - 7 = 1\n\n    My value: 3 * 46 + 5 * 88 + 6 * 87 + 0 * 17 + 1 * 36 = 138 + 440 + 522 + 0 + 36 = 1136. Still too low.\n\n    Given the limited number of rounds, and the initial offer, I will try to get as much of Items 2 and 3 as possible, and some of item 5. I'll offer [2, 0, 0, 4, 5] to Player 1.\n    * Item 1: 3-2 = 1\n    * Item 2: 5-0 = 5\n    * Item 3: 6-0 = 6\n    * Item 4: 4-4 = 0\n    * Item 5: 8-5 = 3\n    My value: 1*46 + 5*88 + 6*87 + 0*17 + 3*36 = 46 + 440 + 522 + 0 + 108 = 1116.\n    Still too low.\n\n    It's clear that getting above my outside offer with a single counteroffer is difficult. I'm prioritizing avoiding Mistakes 2 and 4, so I will aim for the best value I can get, even if below my outside offer.\n\n    Offer them [0, 1, 1, 1, 6].\n    I keep [3, 4, 5, 3, 2]. This gives me 3*46 + 4*88 + 5*87 + 3*17 + 2*36 = 138 + 352 + 435 + 51 + 72 = 1048.\n\n3. **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is significantly worse than my outside offer.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1336. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 822 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 5, 5, 2, 8] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    46 x 3 + 88 x 5 + 87 x 5 + 17 x 2 + 36 x 8\n    which is 1335 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1336. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 5]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 1, 1, 6]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 2, 1, 6]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 2, 1, 6]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best course of action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** 1336\n*   **Item values:** Item 1: 46, Item 2: 88, Item 3: 87, Item 4: 17, Item 5: 36\n*   **Total items:** Item 1: 3, Item 2: 5, Item 3: 6, Item 4: 4, Item 5: 8\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.98. This means that accepting an offer in a later round is slightly less valuable than accepting it now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [2, 1, 2, 1, 6] units of each item. This means I would keep:\n    *   Item 1: 3 - 2 = 1 unit\n    *   Item 2: 5 - 1 = 4 units\n    *   Item 3: 6 - 2 = 4 units\n    *   Item 4: 4 - 1 = 3 units\n    *   Item 5: 8 - 6 = 2 units\n    Value of current offer: 1 * 46 + 4 * 88 + 4 * 87 + 3 * 17 + 2 * 36 = 46 + 352 + 348 + 51 + 72 = 869\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer's value (869) is much less than my outside offer (1336).\n\n*   **Consider a potential counteroffer:** I need to find an offer that gives me a value greater than 1336. Since Player 1 offered me [2, 1, 2, 1, 6] in round 2, which means they keep [1, 4, 4, 3, 2], and previously they offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 5], I will try offering them what I offered last round which led to this offer in round 2 to see if I can get a better deal from accepting it. This means I offer them [0, 1, 1, 1, 6] and I keep [3, 4, 5, 3, 2]. My value of that offer is:\n    3 * 46 + 4 * 88 + 5 * 87 + 3 * 17 + 2 * 36 = 138 + 352 + 435 + 51 + 72 = 1048\n\n    In this scenario, it makes sense to try an offer where I keep more of items I value.\n    I'll make a counteroffer where I keep more of items 2 and 3, offering [1, 2, 3, 2, 7]\n\n    If I offer [1, 2, 3, 2, 7] to player 1, then I would keep [2, 3, 3, 2, 1]. My value would then be:\n    2 * 46 + 3 * 88 + 3 * 87 + 2 * 17 + 1 * 36 = 92 + 264 + 261 + 34 + 36 = 687. This is less than 1336, so this is not a good offer.\n    \n    I'll make a counteroffer where I keep the majority of item 2 and 3: [1, 0, 0, 1, 5]. This implies keeping [2, 5, 6, 3, 3]\n    My value = 2 * 46 + 5 * 88 + 6 * 87 + 3 * 17 + 3 * 36 = 92 + 440 + 522 + 51 + 108 = 1213\n\n    This is still less than 1336. I will now offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 4] to keep all of items 1-4 and four of item 5 which is [3, 5, 6, 4, 4]:\n    Value = 3 * 46 + 5 * 88 + 6 * 87 + 4 * 17 + 4 * 36 = 138 + 440 + 522 + 68 + 144 = 1312. Still less, which means I need to at least get one more item from Player 1 to meet my 1336 target.\n\n    I will offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 3] to keep all of items 1-4 and five of item 5 which is [3, 5, 6, 4, 5]:\n    Value = 3 * 46 + 5 * 88 + 6 * 87 + 4 * 17 + 5 * 36 = 138 + 440 + 522 + 68 + 180 = 1348\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer is not acceptable. Offering [0, 0, 0, 0, 3] to Player 1 yields a value of 1348, which is better than my outside option.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 3]}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This means accepting an offer in a later round is slightly less valuable than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2. **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** I am offered [1, 1, 1, 4, 1]. This means I would receive:\n      - 1 unit of item 1: 1 * 79 = 79\n      - 1 unit of item 2: 1 * 15 = 15\n      - 1 unit of item 3: 1 * 96 = 96\n      - 4 units of item 4: 4 * 85 = 340\n      - 1 unit of item 5: 1 * 8 = 8\n      - Total value: 79 + 15 + 96 + 340 + 8 = 538\n\n   - **Comparison to outside offer:** 538 > 385.

However, I need to consider if I can get an even better deal by making a counteroffer. Player 1's offer suggests they don't value item 4 as much as I do, since they are giving all 4 units of item 4 to me.\n\n   - Let's calculate my value if I keep all items except item 4.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 0, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 962. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 600 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 10, 0, 4, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    45 x 0 + 73 x 10 + 8 x 0 + 9 x 4 + 65 x 3\n    which is 961 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 962. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Item 2 (73 per unit)\n2. Item 5 (65 per unit)\n3. Item 1 (45 per unit)\n4. Item 4 (9 per unit)\n5. Item 3 (8 per unit)\n\nI should keep most of my high-value items (2 and 5) and offer more of my low-value items (3 and 4).\n\nLet me try a strategic initial offer where I keep most high-value items:\nIf I offer [2, 1, 3, 3, 0] to Player 2, I keep [3, 9, 1, 1, 3].\n\nMy value calculation:\n- 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135\n- 9 units of item 2 = 9 \u00d7 73 = 657\n- 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 8 = 8\n- 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 9 = 9\n- 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195\n- Total value = 1004\n\nThis gives me 1004, which is better than my outside offer of 962.\n\n### 3) Decision Making:\n- I won't walk away since I can make an offer better than my outside offer\n- I'll propose a counteroffer that's strategic but not too greedy\n- My first offer will be to give Player 2 [2, 1, 3, 3, 0] (keeping most of my high-value items)\n\nThis is a reasonable starting position that:\n- Gives me value well above my outside offer (1004 > 962)\n- Offers the other player some items (not mistake 3)\n- Is better than my outside offer (not mistake 2)\n- Provides room for negotiation in future rounds\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 3, 3, 0]}",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 218. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 218. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 879 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 1, 0, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    23 x 2 + 100 x 1 + 38 x 0 + 61 x 0 + 71 x 1\n    which is 217 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 218. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 3, 3, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 4, 4, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 4, 4, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 4, 4, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

This means that an offer in the next round is worth 98% of what it would be worth this round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** [1, 0, 4, 4, 0] (given to me). This means Player 2 receives: 1 unit of Item 1, 0 units of Item 2, 4 units of Item 3, 4 units of Item 4, 0 units of Item 5.\n    *   Value of current offer: (1 * 23) + (0 * 100) + (4 * 38) + (4 * 61) + (0 * 71) = 23 + 0 + 152 + 244 + 0 = 419\n    *   Since 419 > 218, accepting the current offer is better than walking away *right now*.\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** Need to evaluate some counteroffers. Since the other player offered me all of item 3 and item 4 in their latest offer, it seems they might not value it as high as me, maybe I can exploit this.\n\n    Let's consider a counteroffer where I give the other player only 1 unit of Item 1, all units of Item 3 and Item 4, and 0 units of Item 5.\n\n    *   Counteroffer: [1, x, 4, 4, 0] (what Player 2 gives to Player 1)\n    *   Player 2 keeps: [4, 10-x, 0, 0, 3]\n    *   Value to Player 2: (4 * 23) + ((10-x) * 100) + (0 * 38) + (0 * 61) + (3 * 71) = 92 + 1000 - 100x + 0 + 0 + 213 = 1305 - 100x.\n\n    If x = 0, I offer [1, 0, 4, 4, 0] back to Player 1, meaning I keep [4, 10, 0, 0, 3].

My value would be 305.\n\n    Let's also consider a counteroffer where I give the other player 0 units of Item 1, all units of Item 3 and Item 4, and 0 units of Item 5.\n\n    *   Counteroffer: [0, x, 4, 4, 0] (what Player 2 gives to Player 1)\n    *   Player 2 keeps: [5, 10-x, 0, 0, 3]\n    *   Value to Player 2: (5 * 23) + ((10-x) * 100) + (0 * 38) + (0 * 61) + (3 * 71) = 115 + 1000 - 100x + 0 + 0 + 213 = 1328 - 100x.\n        If x = 0, I offer [0, 0, 4, 4, 0] to Player 1, meaning I keep [5, 10, 0, 0, 3]. My value would be 1328, which is a very good outcome.\n        If x = 1, I offer [0, 1, 4, 4, 0] to Player 1, meaning I keep [5, 9, 0, 0, 3]. My value would be 1228.\n        If x = 2, I offer [0, 2, 4, 4, 0] to Player 1, meaning I keep [5, 8, 0, 0, 3]. My value would be 1128.\n        If x = 3, I offer [0, 3, 4, 4, 0] to Player 1, meaning I keep [5, 7, 0, 0, 3]. My value would be 1028.\n        If x = 4, I offer [0, 4, 4, 4, 0] to Player 1, meaning I keep [5, 6, 0, 0, 3]. My value would be 928.\n        If x = 5, I offer [0, 5, 4, 4, 0] to Player 1, meaning I keep [5, 5, 0, 0, 3]. My value would be 828.\n        If x = 6, I offer [0, 6, 4, 4, 0] to Player 1, meaning I keep [5, 4, 0, 0, 3].

My value would be 628.\n        If x = 8, I offer [0, 8, 4, 4, 0] to Player 1, meaning I keep [5, 2, 0, 0, 3]. My value would be 528.\n        If x = 9, I offer [0, 9, 4, 4, 0] to Player 1, meaning I keep [5, 1, 0, 0, 3]. My value would be 428.\n        If x = 10, I offer [0, 10, 4, 4, 0] to Player 1, meaning I keep [5, 0, 0, 0, 3]. My value would be 328.\n\n*   **Comparison to Outside Offer:** All the above cases will be better than outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer [1, 0, 4, 4, 0] is pretty good, yielding me 419.\n*   However, making a counteroffer could potentially yield more. I will try for a much better outcome.\n*   The value of the current offer, discounted by 0.98 for one more round, is approximately 410.62. This is still much better than my outside offer of 218.\n\nI will make a counteroffer now. I'll propose giving away all units of Item 3 and Item 4, and 0 unit of Item 1, 3 unit of Item 2, 0 units of Item 5.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 4, 4, 0]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 1, 0, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    23 x 2 + 100 x 1 + 38 x 0 + 61 x 0 + 71 x 1\n    which is 217 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 218. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 3, 3, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 4, 4, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 4, 4, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [0, 3, 4, 4, 0]\nRound 3: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 4, 4, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 4, 4, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 4, 6, 2, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    41 x 1 + 22 x 4 + 20 x 6 + 23 x 2 + 51 x 1\n    which is 346 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 347. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 5, 0, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 5, 0, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n    - My outside offer value is 347.\n    - My values for the items are: item 1: 41, item 2: 22, item 3: 20, item 4: 23, item 5: 51.\n    - The total pool of items is: 2 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5.\n    - The discount factor is 0.98. This means that waiting for a later round reduces the value of any deal.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n    - **Current offer:** The current offer on the table is [0, 5, 0, 2, 0], which means I receive 0 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n    - My value for the current offer is: (0 * 41) + (5 * 22) + (0 * 20) + (2 * 23) + (0 * 51) = 0 + 110 + 0 + 46 + 0 = 156.\n    - 156 is less than my outside offer value of 347.\n\n    - **Potential counteroffers:** I need to create a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 347. Let's consider a counteroffer where I keep most of the items I value highly.\n    - Let's try to keep all of item 1, item 4, and item 5 and 1 unit of item 2 and 1 unit of item 3: offer [0, 5, 5, 0, 0]\n    - My value would be: (2 * 41) + (1 * 22) + (1 * 20) + (2 * 23) + (1 * 51) = 82 + 22 + 20 + 46 + 51 = 221. This is not high enough\n\n    - Let's try to keep all of item 1, item 4, and item 5 and 3 units of item 2 and 3 unit of item 3: offer [0, 3, 3, 0, 0]\n    - My value would be: (2 * 41) + (3 * 22) + (3 * 20) + (2 * 23) + (1 * 51) = 82 + 66 + 60 + 46 + 51 = 305. Still not enough\n\n    - Let's try to keep all of item 1, item 4, and item 5 and 4 units of item 2 and 4 unit of item 3: offer [0, 2, 2, 0, 0]\n    - My value would be: (2 * 41) + (4 * 22) + (4 * 20) + (2 * 23) + (1 * 51) = 82 + 88 + 80 + 46 + 51 = 347. This exactly equals my outside offer\n\n    - Let's try to keep all of item 1, item 4, and item 5 and 5 units of item 2 and 5 unit of item 3: offer [0, 1, 1, 0, 0]\n    - My value would be: (2 * 41) + (5 * 22) + (5 * 20) + (2 * 23) + (1 * 51) = 82 + 110 + 100 + 46 + 51 = 389. This is better than my outside offer!\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n    - The current offer (156) is worse than my outside offer (347), so I should not accept.\n    - I should not walk away yet, as there's a chance to get a better deal.\n    - I will propose the counteroffer [0, 1, 1, 0, 0], which gives me a value of 389.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 1, 0, 0]}\n```",

I want to keep as much of item 5, item 1, and item 4 as possible. Also, round 3 is the last round, so if I counteroffer, my offer would be treated as WALK, and I will get my outside offer value. Thus, the only possible action is ACCEPT, or a counteroffer to Player 1 that would give me items worth more than 347, which might make Player 1 accept and give me even higher value than 347 * 0.98.\n\nLet's consider the current offer again: if I accept this offer I will get 169.54, but if I walk I will get 347. I will not accept this offer.\n\nNow, let's evaluate a possible counteroffer. Let's start by giving the other player very little value. What about giving the other player nothing, and keep all of the items. My value would be:\n2 * 41 + 6 * 22 + 6 * 20 + 2 * 23 + 1 * 51\n= 82 + 132 + 120 + 46 + 51\n= 431\nIf I kept all the items, my value would be 431. In this case I have to discount my value with 0.98 in the last round. Therefore, I would like to give Player 1 an offer that makes them want to accept it.\n\nSo, I have to give them a worthwhile offer, not zero.\n\nLet's offer Player 1: item 1 (1 unit), item 2 (3 units), item 3 (3 units), item 4 (1 units), item 5 (0 units). Then I would keep item 1 (1 units), item 2 (3 units), item 3 (3 units), item 4 (1 units), item 5 (1 units). This would give me:\n1 * 41 + 3 * 22 + 3 * 20 + 1 * 23 + 1 * 51\n= 41 + 66 + 60 + 23 + 51 = 241\n\nSince 241 is smaller than 347, this is a bad offer.\n\nLet's offer Player 1: item 1 (0 units), item 2 (3 units), item 3 (3 units), item 4 (0 units), item 5 (0 units). Then I would keep item 1 (2 units), item 2 (3 units), item 3 (3 units), item 4 (2 units), item 5 (1 units). This would give me:\n2 * 41 + 3 * 22 + 3 * 20 + 2 * 23 + 1 * 51\n= 82 + 66 + 60 + 46 + 51 = 305\nSince 305 is smaller than 347, this is a bad offer.\n\nNow consider the offer of giving Player 1 [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]. That leaves me with:\n1 * 41 + 5 * 22 + 5 * 20 + 1 * 23 + 1 * 51\n= 41 + 110 + 100 + 23 + 51 = 325\nAgain, this is lower than 347, so I won't offer this.\n\nI need to get as close to 347 as possible.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince I cannot make a counteroffer that makes me better off, I will WALK.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 40. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1014 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    34 x 1 + 93 x 0 + 69 x 0 + 100 x 0 + 42 x 0\n    which is 34 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 40. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 40. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 40. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1014 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    34 x 1 + 93 x 0 + 69 x 0 + 100 x 0 + 42 x 0\n    which is 34 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 40. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 2, 0, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 1, 0, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 1, 0, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 575. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 975 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 0, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    46 x 0 + 77 x 3 + 27 x 0 + 91 x 1 + 84 x 3\n    which is 574 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 575. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [4, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [4, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action for Player 2 in this negotiation.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 575\n*   **My values per item:** Item 1: 46, Item 2: 77, Item 3: 27, Item 4: 91, Item 5: 84\n*   **Total items available:** Item 1: 4, Item 2: 8, Item 3: 1, Item 4: 1, Item 5: 3\n*   **Discount factor:** 0.98. This means that an offer accepted in a later round is worth slightly less.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [4, 2, 0, 0, 0]. This means I receive 4 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n\n    *   Value of current offer: (4 * 46) + (2 * 77) + (0 * 27) + (0 * 91) + (0 * 84) = 184 + 154 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 338\n\n    *   Since 338 is less than my outside offer of 575, accepting is not a good choice right now.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer where the value of items I keep is greater than 575. I also need to give Player 1 at least *something*. Let's explore a few options:\n\n    *   **Offer 1: Keep most valuable items:** Give Player 1 [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]. This means I keep [4, 8, 0, 0, 3].\n\n        *   My value: (4 * 46) + (8 * 77) + (0 * 27) + (0 * 91) + (3 * 84) = 184 + 616 + 0 + 0 + 252 = 1052\n        *   This is significantly better than my outside offer.\n\n    *   **Offer 2: Try to balance it:** Give Player 1 [2, 4, 1, 0, 1]. This means I keep [2, 4, 0, 1, 2].\n\n        *   My value: (2 * 46) + (4 * 77) + (0 * 27) + (1 * 91) + (2 * 84) = 92 + 308 + 0 + 91 + 168 = 659\n        *   This is also better than my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is significantly worse than my outside offer. I should definitely not accept. The proposed counteroffers are both better than my outside offer. Since Player 1 clearly doesn't value item 1, let's try offering them more of that, in exchange for keeping more of items I value.\n\nLet's consider counteroffer [1,6,0,0,2] where I keep 3 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 1 of item 4 and 1 of item 5.\n\nThe value of that to me would be:\n(3*46) + (2*77) + (1*27) + (1*91) + (1*84) = 138 + 154 + 27 + 91 + 84 = 494. This is less than my outside offer.\nLet's consider counteroffer [1,6,0,0,1] where I keep 3 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 1 of item 4 and 2 of item 5.\n\nThe value of that to me would be:\n(3*46) + (2*77) + (1*27) + (1*91) + (2*84) = 138 + 154 + 27 + 91 + 168 = 578.

This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 5, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    89 x 1 + 44 x 1 + 96 x 5 + 46 x 1 + 34 x 0\n    which is 659 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 660. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 659. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 732 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Current Situation:**\n\n   - My outside offer value is 659.\n   - My values for items 1-5 are: 56, 39, 49, 55, 45.\n   - The total pool of items is: 1, 3, 5, 4, 5.\n   - The discount factor is 0.98. This means that accepting an offer in a later round is slightly less valuable than accepting it now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of the current offer:**\n\n   - The current offer is [0, 2, 0, 2, 5]. This means Player 1 is offering me 0 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 5 units of item 5.\n   - If I accept this offer, my value would be:\n      (0 * 56) + (2 * 39) + (0 * 49) + (2 * 55) + (5 * 45) = 0 + 78 + 0 + 110 + 225 = 413\n\n   - This value (413) is significantly less than my outside offer of 659.\n\n3) **Consider a potential counteroffer:**\n\n   - I need to make a counteroffer that gives Player 1 some items but leaves me with a value greater than 659. I want to give Player 1 items that I value less and keep items I value more.\n\n4) **Developing a counteroffer:**\n   - Let's start by giving Player 1 the maximum amount of item 2 and item 5. Given the initial item distribution of [1, 3, 5, 4, 5], let's consider a counteroffer where I offer 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n\n5) **Assessing the counteroffer:**\n   - My counteroffer to Player 1: [1, 1, 3, 2, 3]\n   - This means I keep:\n        - Item 1: 1 - 1 = 0 units\n        - Item 2: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n        - Item 3: 5 - 3 = 2 units\n        - Item 4: 4 - 2 = 2 units\n        - Item 5: 5 - 3 = 2 units\n\n   - My value for what I keep would be:\n       (0 * 56) + (2 * 39) + (2 * 49) + (2 * 55) + (2 * 45) = 0 + 78 + 98 + 110 + 90 = 376.\n\n   - This is still less than my outside offer, so this counteroffer isn't good enough.\n\n6) **Another Counteroffer:**\n   - I need to keep more items. I will offer fewer of the items I value highly (4, 5) and try to give away items 1,2,3 to Player 1.\n   - Let me try the counteroffer [1, 3, 5, 4, 5].\n   - If I offer this, it means Player 1 gets all the items and I am left with zero, so my value is zero.\n   - This is worse than my outside offer.\n   - Let me try offering [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n   - Then I get all the items which is 1*56+3*39+5*49+4*55+5*45 = 56 + 117 + 245 + 220 + 225 = 863\n\n7) **Another Counteroffer:**\n   - Let's try to offer a little more, without going below my outside offer of 659.\n\n   - Let's consider a counteroffer where I offer 0 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 2 units of item 5.\n\n   - My counteroffer to Player 1: [0, 1, 2, 1, 2]\n   - This means I keep:\n        - Item 1: 1 - 0 = 1 units\n        - Item 2: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n        - Item 3: 5 - 2 = 3 units\n        - Item 4: 4 - 1 = 3 units\n        - Item 5: 5 - 2 = 3 units\n\n   - My value for what I keep would be:\n       (1 * 56) + (2 * 39) + (3 * 49) + (3 * 55) + (3 * 45) = 56 + 78 + 147 + 165 + 135 = 581.\n\n   - This is still less than my outside offer, so this counteroffer isn't good enough.\n\n8) **Another Counteroffer:**\n   - To get more value, I will propose to take all the item 4 myself since I value it highly.\n\n   -Let's consider a counteroffer where I offer 1 unit of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 0 unit of item 4, 5 unit of item 5.\n\n   - My counteroffer to Player 1: [1, 3, 5, 0, 5]\n   - This means I keep:\n        - Item 1: 1 - 1 = 0 units\n        - Item 2: 3 - 3 = 0 units\n        - Item 3: 5 - 5 = 0 units\n        - Item 4: 4 - 0 = 4 units\n        - Item 5: 5 - 5 = 0 units\n\n   - My value for what I keep would be:\n       (0 * 56) + (0 * 39) + (0 * 49) + (4 * 55) + (0 * 45) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 220 + 0 = 220.\n\n   - This is still less than my outside offer, so this counteroffer isn't good enough.\n\n9) **Another Counteroffer:**\n    - Let's try to keep some item 1, and item 4. I will offer 0 unit of item 1, 2 unit of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 0 unit of item 4, 4 unit of item 5.\n\n   - My counteroffer to Player 1: [0, 2, 4, 0, 4]\n   - This means I keep:\n        - Item 1: 1 - 0 = 1 units\n        - Item 2: 3 - 2 = 1 units\n        - Item 3: 5 - 4 = 1 units\n        - Item 4: 4 - 0 = 4 units\n        - Item 5: 5 - 4 = 1 units\n\n   - My value for what I keep would be:\n       (1 * 56) + (1 * 39) + (1 * 49) + (4 * 55) + (1 * 45) = 56 + 39 + 49 + 220 + 45 = 409.\n\n   - This is still less than my outside offer, so this counteroffer isn't good enough.\n\nSince I only have 3 rounds, and I have already tried to improve the offer, I will WALK.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1086. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 858 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 5, 4, 5, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    26 x 4 + 79 x 5 + 40 x 4 + 84 x 5 + 57 x 0\n    which is 1079 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1086. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 4, 2, 3, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 4, 2, 3, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action.\n\n1. **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value is 1086.\n*   My values for items 1-5 are 26, 79, 40, 84, 57, respectively.\n*   The total pool of items is 5 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n*   The discount factor is 0.98. This means accepting an offer now is slightly better than receiving the same value next round (since the value will be multiplied by 0.98).\n\n2. **Assess the value of the current offer:**\n\nThe current offer on the table (what Player 1 is offering to *me*) is: [1, 4, 2, 3, 0].\n\nThis means I would receive:\n*   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 26 = 26\n*   4 units of item 2: 4 * 79 = 316\n*   2 units of item 3: 2 * 40 = 80\n*   3 units of item 4: 3 * 84 = 252\n*   0 units of item 5: 0 * 57 = 0\n\nTotal value of the current offer: 26 + 316 + 80 + 252 + 0 = 674\n\nComparing this to my outside offer value of 1086, the current offer is significantly worse.\n\n3. **Consider potential counteroffers:**\n\nI need to create a counteroffer that gives Player 1 some items while still leaving me with a value greater than my outside offer of 1086. The total number of each item is 5, so the number of units I keep is 5 minus the amount of that item in the counteroffer.\n\nLet's try to create a counteroffer where I keep most of items 2 and 4, since those are the items I value the most. Let's offer Player 1 [4, 1, 4, 1, 0].\nThis would mean I keep [1, 4, 1, 4, 0], which gives me:\n1 * 26 + 4 * 79 + 1 * 40 + 4 * 84 + 0 * 57 = 26 + 316 + 40 + 336 + 0 = 718. This is less than 1086, so it is not a good offer.\n\nLet's offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\nThis would mean I keep [5, 5, 5, 5, 0], which gives me:\n5 * 26 + 5 * 79 + 5 * 40 + 5 * 84 + 0 * 57 = 130 + 395 + 200 + 420 + 0 = 1145.\n\nSince 1145 > 1086, this is a valid offer.\nSince this is the first turn, making such a demanding offer might lead to a walkaway, but it is a valid offer.\n\n4. **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is far worse than my outside offer. A counteroffer of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] would result in my receiving more than my outside offer. Let's make that counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 5, 4, 5, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    26 x 4 + 79 x 5 + 40 x 4 + 84 x 5 + 57 x 0\n    which is 1079 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1086. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 4, 2, 3, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 4, 2, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 4, 2, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the current situation.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 1086.\n   - My values for items 1 through 5 are 26, 79, 40, 84, and 57, respectively.\n   - The total pool of items is 5 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor is 0.98.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 4, 2, 2, 0]. This means I would receive:\n      - 1 unit of item 1: 1 * 26 = 26\n      - 4 units of item 2: 4 * 79 = 316\n      - 2 units of item 3: 2 * 40 = 80\n      - 2 units of item 4: 2 * 84 = 168\n      - 0 units of item 5: 0 * 57 = 0\n      - Total value: 26 + 316 + 80 + 168 + 0 = 590\n\n      Since this is round 2, the discounted value of accepting this offer is 590 * (0.98)^(2-1) = 590 * 0.98 = 578.2. This is much lower than my outside offer of 1086.\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that Player 1 might accept and that gives me a value greater than my outside offer, accounting for the discount factor.\n\n      Let's consider keeping [4, 1, 3, 3, 0] for myself. This means offering Player 1 [1, 4, 2, 2, 0] which is the current offer on the table.\n      - My value: (4 * 26) + (1 * 79) + (3 * 40) + (3 * 84) + (0 * 57) = 104 + 79 + 120 + 252 + 0 = 555. Discounted value: 555 * 0.98 = 543.9\nThis is less than the outside offer of 1086.\n\n      Let's consider keeping [4, 5, 4, 5, 0] for myself. This means offering Player 1 [1, 0, 1, 0, 0].\n      - My value: (4 * 26) + (5 * 79) + (4 * 40) + (5 * 84) + (0 * 57) = 104 + 395 + 160 + 420 + 0 = 1079. Discounted value: 1079 * 0.98 = 1057.42\nThis is still less than the outside offer of 1086.\n\n      Let's consider keeping [5, 5, 5, 5, 0] for myself. This means offering Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n      - My value: (5 * 26) + (5 * 79) + (5 * 40) + (5 * 84) + (0 * 57) = 130 + 395 + 200 + 420 + 0 = 1145. Discounted value: 1145 * 0.98 = 1122.1\nThis is greater than the outside offer of 1086.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   Accepting the current offer is worse than my outside offer. Offering Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] is a viable counteroffer since I would get 1122.1, more than my outside offer of 1086.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 517. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 792 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 3, 1, 3, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    62 x 1 + 80 x 3 + 57 x 1 + 46 x 3 + 19 x 1\n    which is 516 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 517. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 4, 0, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 4, 0, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best course of action.\n\n1.  **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n    *   My outside offer value: 517\n    *   My values for the items: item 1: 62, item 2: 80, item 3: 57, item 4: 46, item 5: 19.\n    *   Total pool of items: item 1: 3, item 2: 6, item 3: 1, item 4: 5, item 5: 1.\n    *   Discount factor: gamma = 0.98.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 3, 1, 3, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    62 x 1 + 80 x 3 + 57 x 1 + 46 x 3 + 19 x 1\n    which is 516 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 517. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 4, 0, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 3, 0, 2, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 3, 0, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 3, 0, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 517\n*   My values for the items: item 1 = 62, item 2 = 80, item 3 = 57, item 4 = 46, item 5 = 19\n*   Total items: item 1 = 3, item 2 = 6, item 3 = 1, item 4 = 5, item 5 = 1\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.98\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [2, 3, 0, 1, 1]. This means I would receive:\n    *   2 units of item 1\n    *   3 units of item 2\n    *   0 units of item 3\n    *   1 units of item 4\n    *   1 units of item 5\n\n    My value for this offer is: (2 * 62) + (3 * 80) + (0 * 57) + (1 * 46) + (1 * 19) = 124 + 240 + 0 + 46 + 19 = 429\n\n*   This value (429) is less than my outside offer (517).\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to propose a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 517. I will try different allocations.\n    I will now calculate the value of keeping different combinations of items. Note that I can propose any valid split of the total number of each item. If Player 1 proposes that I get 'x' of Item 'y', I get what they offer, and then need to decide how to split up the *remaining* items of Item 'y' to achieve a split better than my outside offer.\n\n    *   Let's start by considering what happens if I keep *everything*. In that case, I'd offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] which implies I'm keeping the following:\n        *   3 units of item 1: 3 * 62 = 186\n        *   6 units of item 2: 6 * 80 = 480\n        *   1 units of item 3: 1 * 57 = 57\n        *   5 units of item 4: 5 * 46 = 230\n        *   1 units of item 5: 1 * 19 = 19\n        *   Total value = 186 + 480 + 57 + 230 + 19 = 972\n\n    Since 972 > 517, it is feasible to find a split where my outcome is better than my outside option. Let's evaluate the outcome if I keep these items: [1, 4, 1, 4, 1]\n        *   1 units of item 1: 1 * 62 = 62\n        *   4 units of item 2: 4 * 80 = 320\n        *   1 units of item 3: 1 * 57 = 57\n        *   4 units of item 4: 4 * 46 = 184\n        *   1 units of item 5: 1 * 19 = 19\n        *   Total value = 62 + 320 + 57 + 184 + 19 = 642\n    If I keep [1, 4, 1, 4, 1], that means I am *offering* Player 1 the following: [2, 2, 0, 1, 0]\n\n    Let's evaluate the outcome if I keep these items: [1, 5, 1, 4, 1]\n        *   1 units of item 1: 1 * 62 = 62\n        *   5 units of item 2: 5 * 80 = 400\n        *   1 units of item 3: 1 * 57 = 57\n        *   4 units of item 4: 4 * 46 = 184\n        *   1 units of item 5: 1 * 19 = 19\n        *   Total value = 62 + 400 + 57 + 184 + 19 = 722\n    If I keep [1, 5, 1, 4, 1], that means I am *offering* Player 1 the following: [2, 1, 0, 1, 0]\n\n    Let's evaluate the outcome if I keep these items: [2, 5, 1, 3, 1]\n        *   2 units of item 1: 2 * 62 = 124\n        *   5 units of item 2: 5 * 80 = 400\n        *   1 units of item 3: 1 * 57 = 57\n        *   3 units of item 4: 3 * 46 = 138\n        *   1 units of item 5: 1 * 19 = 19\n        *   Total value = 124 + 400 + 57 + 138 + 19 = 738\n    If I keep [2, 5, 1, 3, 1], that means I am *offering* Player 1 the following: [1, 1, 0, 2, 0]\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer gives me a value of 429, which is worse than my outside offer of 517. I will propose the counteroffer [1, 1, 0, 2, 0], which has a total value of 738, and is greater than my outside option. I will be giving Player 1 one less unit of item 2 than they are giving me.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 2, 0]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 460. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 507 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 460. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 507 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 1, 3, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    44 x 1 + 4 x 0 + 4 x 1 + 97 x 3 + 20 x 6\n    which is 459 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 460. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 5, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 5, 1, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 5, 1, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",

I have the following items: item 1: 4, item 2: 6, item 3: 2, item 4: 3, item 5: 6\n\n    Let's try keeping most of item 4.\n    If I keep [4, 6, 2, 3, 6], that is worth 4*44 + 6*4 + 2*4 + 3*97 + 6*20 = 176 + 24 + 8 + 291 + 120 = 619.\n    So, offering the player [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] is the same as walking away.\n\n    Let's try keeping 2 of item 1, all of item 4, and all of item 5.\n    Value = 2*44 + 3*97 + 6*20 = 88 + 291 + 120 = 499, which is greater than 460.
