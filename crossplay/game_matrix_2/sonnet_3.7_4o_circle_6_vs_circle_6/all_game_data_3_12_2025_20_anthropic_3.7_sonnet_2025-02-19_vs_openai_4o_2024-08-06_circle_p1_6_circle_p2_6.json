Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 97. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 801 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 1, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

No, this is the first offer.\n- Is my offer worse for me than my outside offer? No, 762 > 97.\n- Am I offering no items or all items? No, I'm offering a balanced split.\n- Is this worse than my outside offer? No, 762 > 97.\n- Is walking away better? No, potential deal value exceeds my outside offer.\n\n## 4) Decision\n\nThis initial offer keeps my most valuable items while offering Player 2 a reasonable division.

If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "I'll analyze this negotiation step by step to determine my best action.\n\n## 1) Current Situation Analysis\n\n- My outside offer value: 1251\n- My item values:\n  * Item 1: 90 per unit (2 units total)\n  * Item 2: 29 per unit (1 unit total)\n  * Item 3: 56 per unit (4 units total)\n  * Item 4: 85 per unit (3 units total)\n  * Item 5: 56 per unit (11 units total)\n- Total pool of items: [2, 1, 4, 3, 11]\n- Discount factor: 0.98 (meaning each round reduces value by 2%)\n- This is round 1, so no discount applies yet\n\n## 2) Value Assessment\n\nSince this is the first round and I need to make an initial offer, I need to calculate what I should keep vs. offer to maximize my value while making an attractive offer to Player 2.\n\nTotal value if I keep all items:\n- Item 1: 2 \u00d7 90 = 180\n- Item 2: 1 \u00d7 29 = 29\n- Item 3: 4 \u00d7 56 = 224\n- Item 4: 3 \u00d7 85 = 255\n- Item 5: 11 \u00d7 56 = 616\n- Total: 1304\n\nGiven my outside offer is 1251, I can afford to offer items worth up to 53 points (1304 - 1251) to Player 2 while still doing better than my outside option.\n\n## 3) Developing a Strategic Offer\n\nLet me consider what would be a good initial offer. I should keep most high-value items (items 1 and 4) while offering some lower-value items to appear reasonable.\n\nIf I offer:\n- 0 units of item 1 (keeping all 2)\n- 0 units of item 2 (keeping all 1)\n- 1 unit of item 3 (keeping 3)\n- 0 units of item 4 (keeping all 3)\n- 3 units of item 5 (keeping 8)\n\nValue calculation for what I keep:\n- Item 1: 2 \u00d7 90 = 180\n- Item 2: 1 \u00d7 29 = 29\n- Item 3: 3 \u00d7 56 = 168\n- Item 4: 3 \u00d7 85 = 255\n- Item 5: 8 \u00d7 56 = 448\n- Total: 1080\n\nThis is less than my outside offer (1251), so this offer doesn't work for me.\n\nLet me try keeping more:\n- 2 units of item 1 (keeping all)\n- 1 unit of item 2 (keeping all)\n- 3 units of item 3 (offering 1)\n- 3 units of item 4 (keeping all)\n- 9 units of item 5 (offering 2)\n\nValue calculation for what I keep:\n- Item a: 2 \u00d7 90 = 180\n- Item b: 1 \u00d7 29 = 29\n- Item c: 3 \u00d7 56 = 168\n- Item d: 3 \u00d7 85 = 255\n- Item e: 9 \u00d7 56 = 504\n- Total: 1136\n\nStill less than my outside offer.\n\nLet me try again:\n- 2 units of item 1 (keeping all)\n- 1 unit of item 2 (keeping all)\n- 4 units of item 3 (keeping all)\n- 3 units of item 4 (keeping all)\n- 10 units of item 5 (offering 1)\n\nValue calculation for what I keep:\n- Item 1: 2 \u00d7 90 = 180\n- Item 2: 1 \u00d7 29 = 29\n- Item 3: 4 \u00d7 56 = 224\n- Item 4: 3 \u00d7 85 = 255\n- Item 5: 10 \u00d7 56 = 560\n- Total: 1248\n\nThis is still below my outside offer (1251).\n\nFinal attempt:\n- 2 units of item 1 (keeping all)\n- 1 unit of item 2 (keeping all)\n- 4 units of item 3 (keeping all)\n- 3 units of item 4 (keeping all)\n- 11 units of item 5 (keeping all)\n\nValue: 1304, which exceeds my outside offer.\n\n## 4) Decision\n\nBased on my analysis, I need to keep almost everything to exceed my outside offer. Since we must make a reasonable offer in the negotiation, I'll offer just 1 unit of item 5 (my least valuable item per unit) to start the negotiation:\n\nValue if I keep:\n- 2 units of item 1\n- 1 unit of item 2\n- 4 units of item 3\n- 3 units of item 4\n- 10 units of item 5\n= 1248\n\nThis is very close to my outside offer (just 3 points below). Given the discount factor and the fact that this is a 3-round negotiation, it makes strategic sense to start with this offer and see how Player 2 responds.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 161. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 909 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party.

They might value item 3 and item 2 more, as they offered me none of those.\n\nLet me try offering:\n- 0 unit of item 1 (keeping 2)\n- 0 unit of item 2 (keeping 1)\n- 0 unit of item 3 (keeping 4)\n- 0 unit of item 4 (keeping 3)\n- 5 units of item 5 (keeping 6)\n\nMy value if I keep [2, 1, 4, 3, 6]: 2\u00d790 + 1\u00d729 + 4\u00d756 + 3\u00d785 + 6\u00d756 = 180 + 29 + 224 + 255 + 336 = 1024\nWith discount: 1024 \u00d7 0.98 = 1003.52\n\nThis is less than my outside offer of 1251, so I need to keep more.\n\nLet me try another offer:\n- 0 unit of item 1 (keeping 2)\n- 0 unit of item 2 (keeping 1)\n- 0 unit of item 3 (keeping 4)\n- 0 unit of item 4 (keeping 3) \n- 2 units of item 5 (keeping 9)\n\nMy value if I keep [2, 1, 4, 3, 9]: 2\u00d790 + 1\u00d729 + 4\u00d756 + 3\u00d785 + 9\u00d756 = 180 + 29 + 224 + 255 + 504 = 1192\nWith discount: 1192 \u00d7 0.98 = 1168.16\n\nStill less than my outside offer.\n\nLet me try one more offer:\n- 0 unit of item 1 (keeping 2)\n- 0 unit of item 2 (keeping 1)\n- 0 unit of item 3 (keeping 4)\n- 0 unit of item 4 (keeping 3)\n- 1 unit of item 5 (keeping 10)\n\nMy value if I keep [2, 1, 4, 3, 10]: 2\u00d790 + 1\u00d729 + 4\u00d756 + 3\u00d785 + 10\u00d756 = 180 + 29 + 224 + 255 + 560 = 1248\nWith discount: 1248 \u00d7 0.98 = 1223.04\n\nThis is still below my outside offer.\n\nGiven the discount factor, I would need to keep almost everything to exceed my outside offer value of 1251. Since we're in round 2, any deal I make gets discounted by 0.98, making it harder to exceed my outside offer.\n\nI think my best option is to walk away and take my outside offer of 1251.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 271. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 819 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 0, 0, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    92 x 0 + 14 x 3 + 13 x 0 + 97 x 0 + 57 x 4\n    which is 270 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 271. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

One more adjustment.\n\nLet's try keeping:\n- 7 units of item 1: 7 \u00d7 34 = 238\n- 4 units of item 2: 4 \u00d7 26 = 104\n- 6 units of item 3: 6 \u00d7 92 = 552\n- 5 units of item 4: 5 \u00d7 71 = 355\n- 7 units of item 5: 7 \u00d7 93 = 651\nTotal value: 1900\n\nStill below my outside offer. Final adjustment.\n\nLet's try keeping:\n- 8 units of item 1: 8 \u00d7 34 = 272\n- 5 units of item 2: 5 \u00d7 26 = 130\n- 6 units of item 3: 6 \u00d7 92 = 552\n- 5 units of item 4: 5 \u00d7 71 = 355\n- 7 units of item 5: 7 \u00d7 93 = 651\nTotal value: 1960\n\nThis is above my outside offer of 1949. \n\nSo my counteroffer to Player 2 would be:\n[0, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\nLet me double-check this is valid:\n- I'm keeping 8 of item 1 (all), offering 0\n- I'm keeping 5 of item 2, offering 2\n- I'm keeping 6 of item 3 (all), offering 0\n- I'm keeping 5 of item 4 (all), offering 0\n- I'm keeping 7 of item 5 (all), offering 0\n\nThis keeps all my highest valued items and minimizes what I offer to Player 2 while still exceeding my outside offer value.\n\n## Decision\n\nSince the current offer on the table is worth significantly less than my outside offer, and I can make a counteroffer that exceeds my outside offer value, I will make a counteroffer giving Player 2 only 2 units of item 2.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]}",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value.

                    "response": "To make an informed decision, let's go through the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1) **Analyze the Current Situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 1155.\n   - My values for the items are: \n     - Item 1: 63\n     - Item 2: 88\n     - Item 3: 50\n     - Item 4: 78\n     - Item 5: 49\n   - Total pool of items:\n     - Item 1: 8 units\n     - Item 2: 7 units\n     - Item 3: 6 units\n     - Item 4: 5 units\n     - Item 5: 7 units\n   - The discount factor is 0.98, which means the value of any offer is slightly reduced for each round that passes. Since we are currently in round 2, any offer accepted now would be valued at 98% of its calculated value.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n   - **Current Offer on the Table:** [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n     - Value of accepting current offer:\n       - 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 63 = 0\n       - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 88 = 176\n       - 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 50 = 0\n       - 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 78 = 0\n       - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 49 = 0\n     - Total value of current offer = 176\n     - Discounted value for round 2 = 176 \u00d7 0.98 = 172.48\n     - This is significantly less than my outside offer of 1155.\n\n   - **Evaluate Potential Counteroffers:**\n     - I need to propose a division where my total value exceeds my outside offer of 1155. Let's explore holding more units with high value to me.\n\n     For example, consider keeping:\n     - [0 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5] for myself, offering the remaining to Player 1.\n\n     - Calculate my value:\n       - 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 63 = 0\n       - 5 units of item 2 = 5 \u00d7 88 = 440\n       - 5 units of item 3 = 5 \u00d7 50 = 250\n       - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234\n       - 5 units of item 5 = 5 \u00d7 49 = 245\n     - My total value = 1169\n     - Discounted value in round 2 = 1169 \u00d7 0.98 = 1145.62\n\n     Notice that although the discounted total value slightly falls below my outside offer, proposing this counteroffer maintains a strong position for future rounds if my opponent fails to accept. I need to ensure that I iterate to improve it slightly since it needs to definitively exceed 1155.\n\n     A slightly better configuration could be:\n     - [0 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5] for myself:\n       - Valuation:\n         - 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 63 = 0\n         - 6 units of item 2 = 6 \u00d7 88 = 528\n         - 5 units of item 3 = 5 \u00d7 50 = 250\n         - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234\n         - 4 units of item 5 = 4 \u00d7 49 = 196\n       - My total valuation = 1208\n       - Discounted value in round 2 = 1208 \u00d7 0.98 = 1183.84\n\n     The above value of 1183.84 exceeds my outside offer of 1155 and ensures I make a suitable counteroffer without risking sub-optimal choices.\n\n3) **Make a Decision:**\n   - The current offer gives me just 172.48 in value, far below my outside offer. So, it's clearly not acceptable.\n   - WALK is also not the best option as I've identified a potential counteroffer that, even after discounting, exceeds my outside offer.\n   - Proposing a COUNTEROFFER with the configuration [8, 1, 1, 2, 3] to Player 1 (keeping units [0, 6, 5, 3, 4] respectively):\n     - This ensures that my calculation remains above 1155 even after round discounting.\n\nThus, my strategic action is:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [8, 1, 1, 2, 3]}\n```",

If I accept now, the discount is \u03b3\u00b2 = 0.98\u00b2\n\n## 2) Assess Value of Current Offer\n\nThe current offer from Player 2 gives me: [8, 1, 1, 2, 3]\nLet me calculate the value to me:\n- 8 units of item 1 = 8 \u00d7 34 = 272\n- 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 26 = 26\n- 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 92 = 92\n- 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 71 = 142\n- 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279\n\nTotal value = 272 + 26 + 92 + 142 + 279 = 811\n\nIncluding the discount factor (0.98\u00b2): 811 \u00d7 0.9604 = 778.88\n\nThis is much less than my outside offer of 1949.\n\n## 3) Consider Possible Counteroffers\n\nSince we're in Round 3, and I would be making the final counteroffer, I need to maximize my value. The optimal strategy would be to keep the items that have the highest value to me while offering just enough to Player 2 to make it worthwhile.\n\nFrom their past offers, Player 2 seems willing to give up all of item 1, suggesting they don't value it highly, while they seem to value items 3, 4, and 5 more.\n\nLet me try keeping most of the high-value items (3, 4, and 5) and offering more of items 1 and 2:\n\nIf I keep [2, 2, 6, 5, 7] (and offer [6, 5, 0, 0, 0]), my value would be:\n- 2 \u00d7 34 = 68\n- 2 \u00d7 26 = 52\n- 6 \u00d7 92 = 552\n- 5 \u00d7 71 = 355\n- 7 \u00d7 93 = 651\n\nTotal value = 68 + 52 + 552 + 355 + 651 = 1678\n\nWith discount: 1678 \u00d7 0.9604 = 1611.55\n\nThis is still less than my outside offer of 1949.\n\nLet me try keeping more of item 1:\nIf I keep [4, 2, 6, 5, 7] (and offer [4, 5, 0, 0, 0]), my value would be:\n- 4 \u00d7 34 = 136\n- 2 \u00d7 26 = 52\n- 6 \u00d7 92 = 552\n- 5 \u00d7 71 = 355\n- 7 \u00d7 93 = 651\n\nTotal value = 136 + 52 + 552 + 355 + 651 = 1746\n\nWith discount: 1746 \u00d7 0.9604 = 1676.86\n\nStill below my outside offer.\n\nLet me try keeping even more:\nIf I keep [6, 2, 6, 5, 7] (and offer [2, 5, 0, 0, 0]), my value would be:\n- 6 \u00d7 34 = 204\n- 2 \u00d7 26 = 52\n- 6 \u00d7 92 = 552\n- 5 \u00d7 71 = 355\n- 7 \u00d7 93 = 651\n\nTotal value = 204 + 52 + 552 + 355 + 651 = 1814\n\nWith discount: 1814 \u00d7 0.9604 = 1742.17\n\nStill below my outside offer.\n\nLet's try keeping even more:\nIf I keep [8, 2, 6, 5, 7] (and offer [0, 5, 0, 0, 0]), my value would be:\n- 8 \u00d7 34 = 272\n- 2 \u00d7 26 = 52\n- 6 \u00d7 92 = 552\n- 5 \u00d7 71 = 355\n- 7 \u00d7 93 = 651\n\nTotal value = 272 + 52 + 552 + 355 + 651 = 1882\n\nWith discount: 1882 \u00d7 0.9604 = 1807.47\n\nThis is still below my outside offer of 1949.\n\n## 4) Final Decision\n\nAfter careful analysis:\n- The current offer's value to me (778.88) is significantly less than my outside offer (1949)\n- My best counteroffer still falls short of my outside offer\n- Given this is the last round, there will be no more opportunities to negotiate\n\nThe rational choice is to WALK away and take my outside offer of 1949.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 59. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 384 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 2, 4, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    2 x 2 + 74 x 0 + 11 x 2 + 8 x 4 + 33 x 0\n    which is 58 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 59.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 4, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    100 x 0 + 31 x 2 + 13 x 4 + 85 x 1 + 19 x 1\n    which is 218 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 219. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Thus, I should not accept the current offer. Proposing a counteroffer needs to ensure a value greater than 506.\n\n#### Example Counteroffer Calculation\n\nTo exceed a value of 506 by offering player 1 a different share, let's emphasize keeping high-value items for myself:\n\n- If I keep the maximum units of high-value items for myself and reconsider the distribution:\n  - Keeping 5 units of item 1: value = 5 \u00d7 73 = 365\n  - Keeping 0 units of item 2: value = 0 \u00d7 3 = 0\n  - Keeping 3 units of item 3: value = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168\n  - Keeping 1 unit of item 4: value = 1 \u00d7 30 = 30\n  - Keeping 0 units of item 5: value = 0 \u00d7 68 = 0\n  - **Total = 563**\n\nThis strategy ensures a value exceeding 506 (from the outside offer) and factors in the potential value I maximize from critical items. \n\n#### Counteroffer:\n\nTo optimize my outcome, I'll offer player 1 remaining items as follows:\nKeep [5, 0, 3, 1, 0] for myself and offer [0, 7, 2, 0, 2] to player 1.\n\nTherefore, here is my action:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 7, 2, 0, 2]}\n```",

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "I need to analyze this negotiation carefully to make the best decision for round 2.\n\n## 1) Current Situation Analysis\n\n- My outside offer value: 533\n- My item values: 33 for item 1, 52 for item 2, 61 for item 3, 59 for item 4, 53 for item 5\n- Total pool: 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 8 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5\n- Discount factor: 0.98 (currently round 2, so discount would be 0.98^1 = 0.98)\n\n## 2) Value Assessment\n\n**Current offer from Player 2 (what I would receive):**\n- 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 33 = 66\n- 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 52 = 52\n- 4 units of item 3: 4 \u00d7 61 = 244\n- 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 59 = 118\n- 0 units of item 5: 0 \u00d7 53 = 0\n- Total raw value: 480\n- Discounted value (round 2): 480 \u00d7 0.98 = 470.4\n\nSince 470.4 < 533 (my outside offer), accepting this offer would be worse than walking away.\n\n## 3) Potential Counteroffer Analysis\n\nI should keep items that give me the highest value. Item 3 and 4 are my highest-value items (61 and 59).\n\nLet me try a counteroffer where I keep:\n- 0 units of item 1 (give 2 to Player 2)\n- 1 unit of item 2 (give 1 to Player 2)\n- 5 units of item 3 (give 3 to Player 2)\n- 4 units of item 4 (give 2 to Player 2)\n- 5 units of item 5 (give 0 to Player 2)\n\nValue calculation for what I keep:\n- 0 \u00d7 33 = 0\n- 1 \u00d7 52 = 52\n- 5 \u00d7 61 = 305\n- 4 \u00d7 59 = 236\n- 5 \u00d7 53 = 265\n- Total: 858\n- Discounted value: 858 \u00d7 0.98 = 840.84\n\nThis is significantly better than my outside offer (840.84 > 533).\n\nLooking at Player 2's offer, they seem to want all of item 1 and none of item 5, suggesting they value item 1 highly and item 5 less. They're also asking for 4 units of item 3, which I value highly.\n\nLet me adjust my offer slightly to potentially make it more appealing while still maintaining good value for myself:\n\n**Final counteroffer (what I give to Player 2):**\n[2, 1, 3, 2, 0]\n\nThis means I keep:\n- 0 units of item 1\n- 1 unit of item 2\n- 5 units of item 3\n- 4 units of item 4\n- 5 units of item 5\n\nWith value to me:\n- 0 \u00d7 33 = 0\n- 1 \u00d7 52 = 52\n- 5 \u00d7 61 = 305\n- 4 \u00d7 59 = 236\n- 5 \u00d7 53 = 265\n- Total: 858\n- Discounted value: 858 \u00d7 0.98 = 840.84\n\nThis offer:\n1. Is much better than my outside offer (840.84 > 533)\n2. Gives Player 2 all of item 1 which they seem to value\n3. Keeps most of items 3, 4, and 5 for me which I value highly\n4. Is reasonable and not being too greedy\n\n## 4) Decision\n\nWait, I notice that my counteroffer [2, 1, 3, 2, 0] is exactly the same as my initial offer in Round 1. Player 2 rejected this and countered with [2, 1, 4, 2, 0]. They want one more unit of item 3.\n\nLet me try a slightly different counteroffer, giving them one more unit of item 3 but keeping one more unit of item 4:\n\nNew counteroffer (what I give to Player 2): [2, 1, 4, 1, 0]\n\nThis means I keep:\n- 0 units of item 1\n- 1 unit of item 2\n- 4 units of item 3\n- 5 units of item 4\n- 5 units of item 5\n\nWith value to me:\n- 0 \u00d7 33 = 0\n- 1 \u00d7 52 = 52\n- 4 \u00d7 61 = 244\n- 5 \u00d7 59 = 295\n- 5 \u00d7 53 = 265\n- Total: 856\n- Discounted value: 856 \u00d7 0.98 = 838.88\n\nThis is still significantly better than my outside offer and may be more acceptable to Player 2.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 4, 1, 0]}",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 432. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 432. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 714 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 2, 4, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    73 x 0 + 50 x 1 + 41 x 2 + 71 x 4 + 3 x 5\n    which is 431 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 432. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 356. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1050 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 1, 2, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    61 x 2 + 51 x 1 + 91 x 2 + 83 x 0 + 64 x 0\n    which is 355 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 356. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 1, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 1, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Thus, this offer is not acceptable.\n\n### Step 3: Make a decision\n\nGiven the value of the current offer is less than my outside offer, I should not accept it. Additionally, walking away with my outside offer value of 356 is preferable to accepting the current offer of 318. However, proposing a counteroffer that exceeds my outside offer could potentially result in a better outcome if accepted by Player 1.\n\n**Propose a Counteroffer**\n\nTo be better than my outside offer, the counteroffer must provide a value greater than 356. Let's calculate a reasonable counteroffer:\n\n- **Potential Counteroffer [0, 1, 2, 0, 1] (Keeping for Myself)**\n  - Keep 3 - 0 = 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 61 = 183\n  - Keep 2 - 1 = 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 51 = 51\n  - Keep 5 - 2 = 3 units of item 3: 3 \u00d7 91 = 273\n  - Keep 3 - 0 = 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 83 = 249\n  - Keep 1 - 1 = 0 units of item 5: 0 \u00d7 64 = 0\n  - Total Value = 183 + 51 + 273 + 249 + 0 = 756\n\nThis value totals 756, which is well above my outside offer of 356 and leaves Player 1 with a possibly acceptable division based on their preferences.\n\nTherefore, I will make the following counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 2, 0, 1]}",

This means I would keep:\n- 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 42 = 126\n- 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 58 = 58\n- 3 units of item 3: 3 \u00d7 91 = 273\n- 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 29 = 87\n- 0 units of item 5: 0 \u00d7 100 = 0\n\nTotal value to me: 126 + 58 + 273 + 87 + 0 = 544\nWith discount: 544 \u00d7 0.98 = 533.12\n\nThis is significantly better than my outside offer of 349.\n\n## Step 3: Consider potential counteroffers\nLet me consider what I can gather from Player 2's offers:\n- Player 2 requested 0 units of item 1 and 0 units of item 4 - they may not value these items highly\n- Player 2 requested 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, and 1 unit of item 5 - they may value these items highly\n\nA reasonable counteroffer might be [0, 1, 2, 3, 0], where I keep all of items 1 and 5, half of item 2, and most of item 3:\n- I keep 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 42 = 126\n- I keep 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 58 = 58\n- I keep 3 units of item 3: 3 \u00d7 91 = 273\n- I keep 0 units of item 4: 0 \u00d7 29 = 0\n- I keep 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 100 = 100\n\nMy value: 126 + 58 + 273 + 0 + 100 = 557\nWith discount (for round 2): 557 \u00d7 0.98 = 545.86\n\nHowever, making a counteroffer means we move to round 3, which would apply a second discount factor.\n\n## Step 4: Decision\nLet's compare my options:\n1. Accept current offer: Value = 533.12\n2. Make a counteroffer: Potential value in next round would be further discounted\n3.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 914. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 861 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 3, 1, 6, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    8 x 4 + 86 x 3 + 46 x 1 + 70 x 6 + 77 x 2\n    which is 910 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 914. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

Walking away is also not optimal in the first round unless the outside offer is better than any likely negotiation outcome (which we will explore further). Thus, making a counteroffer is a sensible decision to potentially achieve a higher value.\n\n### Counteroffer Strategy\nTo counteroffer effectively:\n- Aim for a division where my total value exceeds my outside offer of 483.\n- Prioritize items with a high value per unit for myself, particularly items 4 and 5.\n- As a test proposal, let's consider a plausible skewed distribution focusing on high-value items.\n\n#### Example Counteroffer Calculation\nSuppose we offer Player 1 the following: [0, 0, 3, 1, 0]\n- We keep: [4, 3, 0, 5, 3]\n- Value to me:\n  - 4 units of Item 1 = 4 \u00d7 44 = 176\n  - 3 units of Item 2 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246\n  - 0 units of Item 3 = 0 \u00d7 1 = 0\n  - 5 units of Item 4 = 5 \u00d7 100 = 500\n  - 3 units of Item 5 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282\n  - Total = 176 + 246 + 0 + 500 + 282 = 1204\n\nThis counteroffer gives me a value significantly higher than my outside offer of 483. Thus, it's a strategic counteroffer.\n\n### Conclusion\nGiven the analysis above, I will make a counteroffer aiming to improve my position.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 3, 1, 0]}",

They're keeping all of items 1, 2, and 5, suggesting they might value these items.\n\n**My previous offer was [4, 0, 1, 1, 0]**, meaning I was giving Player 2:\n- All 4 units of item 1 (my lowest value item)\n- 0 units of item 2 (my highest value item)\n- 1 unit of item 3 (medium value)\n- 1 unit of item 4 (high value)\n- 0 units of item 5 (high value)\n\n### 3) Formulating a New Counteroffer:\n\nLet me calculate a new counteroffer that:\n- Gives me value above my outside offer (914)\n- Takes into account Player 2's apparent preferences\n\nIf I keep:\n- 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 8 = 0 (giving all to Player 2)\n- 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (keeping all)\n- 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 46 = 92 (giving 1 to Player 2)\n- 5 units of item 4 = 5 \u00d7 70 = 350 (giving 1 to Player 2)\n- 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (keeping all)\n\nTotal value to me = 931, which is greater than my outside offer of 914.\n\nThis means I would offer Player 2:\n[4, 0, 1, 1, 0] - which is the same as my previous offer.\n\nLet me try a slightly different allocation that might be more appealing to Player 2 based on their revealed preferences:\n\nIf I keep:\n- 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 8 = 0 (giving all to Player 2)\n- 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (keeping all)\n- 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 46 = 92 (giving 1 to Player 2)\n- 4 units of item 4 = 4 \u00d7 70 = 280 (giving 2 to Player 2)\n- 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (keeping all)\n\nTotal value = 861, which with discount becomes 861 \u00d7 0.98 = 843.78\nThis is below my outside offer, so it's not acceptable.\n\nLet's try one more allocation:\nIf I keep:\n- 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 8 = 0 (giving all to Player 2)\n- 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (keeping all)\n- 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 46 = 92 (giving 1 to Player 2)\n- 5 units of item 4 = 5 \u00d7 70 = 350 (giving 1 to Player 2)\n- 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (keeping all)\n\nTotal value = 931, which with discount becomes 931 \u00d7 0.98 = 912.38\nThis is slightly below my outside offer of 914, but very close.\n\nLet me revise to ensure I'm above my outside offer with the discount:\nIf I keep:\n- 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 8 = 8 (giving 3 to Player 2)\n- 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (keeping all)\n- 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 46 = 92 (giving 1 to Player 2)\n- 5 units of item 4 = 5 \u00d7 70 = 350 (giving 1 to Player 2)\n- 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (keeping all)\n\nTotal value = 939, which with discount becomes 939 \u00d7 0.98 = 920.22\nThis is above my outside offer of 914.\n\nTherefore, my counteroffer to Player 2 would be [3, 0, 1, 1, 0].\n\n### 4) Decision:\nI should make a counteroffer of [3, 0, 1, 1, 0]. This gives Player 2 most of item 1, some of items 3 and 4, while I keep all of items 2 and 5 which are my highest value items.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 483. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 963 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 2, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    44 x 0 + 82 x 0 + 1 x 0 + 100 x 2 + 94 x 3\n    which is 482 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 483. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values.

Therefore, future gains need to be higher to offset the depreciation due to discount over rounds.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n#### Current Offer: [3, 0, 1, 1, 0]\n\n- **Units I'm Keeping:** [1, 3, 2, 5, 3]\n\n  - Value of kept items:\n    - Item 1: 1 \u00d7 44 = 44\n    - Item 2: 3 \u00d7 82 = 246\n    - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 1 = 2\n    - Item 4: 5 \u00d7 100 = 500\n    - Item 5: 3 \u00d7 94 = 282\n\n  - **Total Value:** 44 + 246 + 2 + 500 + 282 = 1,074\n\n  - **Discounted Value:** 1,074 \u00d7 0.98 = 1,052.52\n\n#### Comparison with Outside Offer:\n\n- Since the discounted value is 1,052.52, which is significantly higher than my outside offer of 483, this offer is advantageous.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nGiven that accepting the current offer yields a value way above my outside offer value after the discount factor is applied, it is clearly beneficial. Walking away or making a counteroffer may jeopardize an advantageous negotiation position, as the current offer already meets my value objectives efficiently and any subsequent delay could reduce the present value further due to the discount.\n\nTherefore, my best course of action is to accept the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

However, I shouldn't be too greedy since this is the first round.\n\nLet me propose an offer where I keep:\n- Item 1: 2 units (all) = 74 value\n- Item 2: 0 units = 0 value\n- Item 3: 6 units (of 7) = 294 value\n- Item 4: 1 unit (of 2) = 30 value\n- Item 5: 2 units (of 6) = 18 value\n\nWhat I offer to Player 2:\n- Item 1: 0 units\n- Item 2: 2 units (all)\n- Item 3: 1 unit\n- Item 4: 1 unit\n- Item 5: 4 units\n\n## 5. Calculate Value of My Proposed Division\nMy value from keeping these items would be:\n74 + 0 + 294 + 30 + 18 = 416\n\nThis is significantly better than my outside offer of 167, making it a good strategic first offer.\n\n## 6. Check for Potential Mistakes\n- Not making an offer worse than previous (no previous offer)\n- My value (416) is greater than my outside offer (167)\n- I'm not offering no items or all items\n- Not accepting an offer worse than outside offer (no offer to accept yet)\n- Not walking away from a good offer (no offer yet)\n\nThis offer allows me to keep my highest-value items while making a reasonable offer to the other player. I'm offering all of my lowest-value item (item 2) and significant portions of my lower-value items (items 4 and 5), while keeping most of my highest-value item (item 3).\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 1, 1, 4]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 479. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 711 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 6, 0, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    23 x 0 + 47 x 2 + 18 x 6 + 80 x 0 + 69 x 4\n    which is 478 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 479. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 1, 1, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 1, 1, 4]\n\n    What is your action?

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 3, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    56 x 0 + 97 x 0 + 42 x 3 + 31 x 1 + 8 x 0\n    which is 157 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 159. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

I want to maximize my value while making an offer that could be acceptable to Player 2.\n\nI should keep most of my high-value items (3 and 5) and be more generous with my low-value items (2 and 4).\n\nLet me try a potential offer where I give to Player 2:\n- 2 units of item 1 (keeping 2 for myself)\n- 3 units of item 2 (keeping 1 for myself)\n- 1 unit of item 3 (keeping 3 for myself)\n- 5 units of item 4 (keeping 2 for myself)\n- 1 unit of item 5 (keeping 3 for myself)\n\nValue I keep:\n- 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 41 = 82\n- 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 15 = 15\n- 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297\n- 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 14 = 28\n- 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 96 = 288\nTotal value: 710\n\nThis is significantly better than my outside offer of 208.\n\n## Step 3: Making a decision\n\nThe offer I'm considering keeps 710 value for me, which is much better than my outside offer of 208. It gives a reasonable amount of items to Player 2 while keeping my most valuable items.\n\nI'll propose this as my initial offer, giving to Player 2:\n[2, 3, 1, 5, 1]\n\nThis means I'm offering Player 2:\n- 2 units of item 1\n- 3 units of item 2\n- 1 unit of item 3\n- 5 units of item 4\n- 1 unit of item 5\n\nThis seems like a reasonable starting point for negotiation.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 3, 1, 5, 1]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 182. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 717 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 1, 0, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    22 x 2 + 91 x 1 + 39 x 0 + 46 x 1 + 41 x 0\n    which is 181 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 182. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 3, 1, 5, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 3, 1, 5, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 2, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    61 x 0 + 39 x 0 + 60 x 2 + 78 x 1 + 83 x 1\n    which is 281 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 282. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 3, 6, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 3, 6, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 877. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 798 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 3, 4, 4, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    34 x 3 + 22 x 3 + 74 x 4 + 92 x 4 + 44 x 1\n    which is 876 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 877. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 378. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 723 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 4, 0, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    57 x 0 + 47 x 2 + 1 x 4 + 43 x 0 + 93 x 3\n    which is 377 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 378. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",

In round 1, this factor doesn't affect the current offer since gamma^0 = 1. However, moving to future rounds would reduce the value of the items I receive by the discount factor for each additional round, which should be considered when deciding to counter or accept now.\n\n2) Assess the value of the current offer:\n   - Current offer to me: [1, 1, 3, 1, 2]\n   - My total value if I accept it:\n     - Item 1: 1 \u00d7 57 = 57\n     - Item 2: 1 \u00d7 47 = 47\n     - Item 3: 3 \u00d7 1 = 3\n     - Item 4: 1 \u00d7 43 = 43\n     - Item 5: 2 \u00d7 93 = 186\n   - Total value = 57 + 47 + 3 + 43 + 186 = 336\n\n3) Compare the total value of the current offer to my outside offer:\n   - Current offer value: 336\n   - Outside offer value: 378\n\nBased on this analysis, accepting the current offer gives me a value of 336, which is less than my outside offer of 378. According to the proposed negotiation strategy, I should not accept an offer worse than my outside offer and instead aim to either make a more favorable counteroffer or consider walking away.\n\nNext, I'll consider making a counteroffer that ensures the value exceeds my outside offer. One approach is to keep items with high value for me and give the other player items that I value less to ensure I achieve at least 379 in value.\n\nTo propose a counteroffer:\n- My aim is to extract the most value, which comes from item 5 primarily, then items 1, 2, and 4.\n- Let's propose: [1, 2, 4, 1, 0] (keeping the valuable item 5 for myself).\n\nCalculate value if I keep [1, 3, 0, 3, 4]:\n- Item 1: 1 \u00d7 57 = 57\n- Item 2: 3 \u00d7 47 = 141\n- Item 3: 0 \u00d7 1 = 0\n- Item 4: 3 \u00d7 43 = 129\n- Item 5: 4 \u00d7 93 = 372\n- Total value = 57 + 141 + 0 + 129 + 372 = 699\n\nThis modified proposal provides a much higher value of 699 compared to my outside offer of 378, and it\u2019s still appealing since it accounts for potential future negotiation rounds.\n\nTherefore, my action is:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 4, 1, 0]}\n```",

Let me analyze which items are most valuable to me:\n\nValue per unit ranking:\n1. Item 2: 45 per unit (highest)\n2. Item 4: 36 per unit\n3. Item 1: 21 per unit\n4. Item 3: 4 per unit\n5. Item 5: 2 per unit (lowest)\n\nFor my first offer, I should try to keep most of my high-value items (items 2 and 4) and offer more of my low-value items (items 3 and 5).\n\nLet me construct a potential offer where I give Player 2:\n- Item 1: 1 unit (keeping 2 for myself)\n- Item 2: 0 units (keeping all 3 for myself)\n- Item 3: 7 units (keeping 2 for myself)\n- Item 4: 1 unit (keeping 3 for myself)\n- Item 5: 2 units (giving all to Player 2)\n\nMy value if this offer is accepted:\n- Item 1: 2 \u00d7 21 = 42\n- Item 2: 3 \u00d7 45 = 135\n- Item 3: 2 \u00d7 4 = 8\n- Item 4: 3 \u00d7 36 = 108\n- Item 5: 0 \u00d7 2 = 0\n- Total: 293\n\nThis is better than my outside offer of 271, so it's a valid offer.\n\n## 3) Decision Making\n\nSince this is the first round, I should start with an offer that favors me while still giving Player 2 something of value. The offer above gives me 293 points while still offering Player 2 a reasonable number of items (11 out of 21 total items).\n\nThis offer avoids all five potential mistakes:\n- Not worse than a previous offer (this is my first offer)\n- Better than my outside offer (293 > 271)\n- Not offering no items or all items\n- Not accepting an offer worse than my outside offer\n- Not walking away from a better offer\n\nI'll make this counteroffer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 7, 1, 2]}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 8, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    82 x 0 + 81 x 0 + 25 x 8 + 56 x 0 + 27 x 0\n    which is 200 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 202.

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 199. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 199. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 948 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 0, 2, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    88 x 2 + 86 x 0 + 85 x 0 + 10 x 2 + 47 x 0\n    which is 196 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 199. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Let's analyze the current situation and make a decision:\n\n### 1) Analyze the Current Situation:\n- **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 199.\n- **Values of the Items (per unit):**\n  - Item 1: 88\n  - Item 2: 86\n  - Item 3: 85\n  - Item 4: 10\n  - Item 5: 47\n- **Total Pool of Items:** [6, 3, 3, 6, 2]\n- **Discount Factor Influence:** Considering the discount factor of gamma = 0.98, the value of accepting the current offer in the first round is not adjusted for the discount, since it's round 1. The present value for future rounds would be compared based on gamma adjustments. However, in round 1, there's no discount applied.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n- **Current Offer (Player 1's Offer):** [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n  - Value to me: \n    - 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 88 = 0\n    - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 86 = 172\n    - 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 85 = 0\n    - 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 10 = 0\n    - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 47 = 0\n  - Total value = 172\n\nThe value of the current offer (172) is less than my outside offer (199). Accepting this offer would be a mistake as per Mistake 4. \n\n- **Potential Counteroffers:**\n  I need to propose a counteroffer that gives a value greater than 199 to me.\n  \n  One possible option could be to propose that I keep high-value items such as item 1, item 2, and item 3 as I have high personal valuations for these items.\n\n  Let's try:\n  - Counteroffer [0, 0, 1, 6, 2]: (the rest goes to me, maximizing my highly valued items)\n    - My Share:\n      - 6 units of item 1 = 6 \u00d7 88 = 528\n      - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258\n      - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 85 = 170\n      - 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 10 = 0 (depending on the split)\n      - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 47 = 0 (depending on the split)\n    - Total value for me (after allocation) = 528 + 258 + 170 = 956 (ignoring items 4 and 5 since we keep none)\n  \n  The value of this counteroffer is significantly higher than my outside offer value of 199.\n\nGiven this consideration, a reasonable strategy would be to keep items that maximize my value and then see how many less valuable items (like item 4) I can balance.\n\n### 3) Decision:\nSince the current offer from Player 1 (172) is less than my outside offer (199), the action to take is either to propose a counteroffer that meets my threshold or walk.\n\nI'll propose a counteroffer to maximize my value, maintaining the strategy of keeping high-value items and distributing less valuable ones.\n\n**Counteroffer Proposal:**\n- Keeping 5 units of Item 1, 1 unit of Item 3 for maximizing gain value, allow Players 1 the lesser desired items and one unit of the lesser devalued item 2.\n  This attempts to not only maximize gain but also to avoid overly aggressive or unaccounted offers.\n\nHere is my decision:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 2, 0, 0]}\n```\n\nExplanation: \n- This offer keeps enough of item 1, item 2, item 3 for myself to ensure a higher personal valuation, ample items for player 1 to share balance, and predicts this will not induce a worst-position for further negotiations unless player 1 reciprocates with unfavorable or regressive offers.",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 2, 2, 7] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    31 x 0 + 73 x 0 + 22 x 2 + 48 x 2 + 99 x 7\n    which is 833 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 834. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?
