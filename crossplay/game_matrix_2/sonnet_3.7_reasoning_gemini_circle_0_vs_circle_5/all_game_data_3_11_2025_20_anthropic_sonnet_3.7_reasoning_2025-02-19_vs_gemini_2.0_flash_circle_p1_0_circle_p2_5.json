Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 437. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 795 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 1, 0, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    49 x 2 + 80 x 1 + 41 x 0 + 18 x 1 + 77 x 3\n    which is 427 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 437. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 0, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

This means that accepting an offer later is slightly less valuable than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [1, 0, 0, 1, 1]. This means I would receive:\n    *   1 unit of item 1\n    *   0 units of item 2\n    *   0 units of item 3\n    *   1 unit of item 4\n    *   1 unit of item 5\n    My value for this offer would be: (1 * 49) + (0 * 80) + (0 * 41) + (1 * 18) + (1 * 77) = 49 + 0 + 0 + 18 + 77 = 144\n*   Since 144 < 437, accepting this offer is worse than walking away and taking my outside offer.\n\nNow let's consider a few potential counteroffers and their values to me:\n\n* **Counteroffer 1: Give Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].** This means I keep everything:\n    * 3 * 49 + 1 * 80 + 0 * 41 + 2 * 18 + 3 * 77 = 147 + 80 + 0 + 36 + 231 = 494\n* **Counteroffer 2: Give Player 1 [1, 0, 0, 1, 1].** This is effectively the current offer flipped, where I give the other player what they are offering me.\n  * value = 144 (as calculated before)\n* **Counteroffer 3: Give Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 2, 0].** This means I have all items except the item 4s.\n  * 3 * 49 + 1 * 80 + 0 * 41 + 0 * 18 + 3 * 77 = 147 + 80 + 0 + 0 + 231 = 458\n* **Counteroffer 4: Give Player 1 [0, 1, 0, 0, 0].** This means I have all items except the item 2.\n  * 3 * 49 + 0 * 80 + 0 * 41 + 2 * 18 + 3 * 77 = 147 + 0 + 0 + 36 + 231 = 414\n\nBased on these calculations:\n\n* Counteroffer 1 is good, but likely not acceptable to Player 1, so it risks a walk.\n* Counteroffer 2 would be a mistake, because I'm not accepting it, and it just results in the same value as the offer already on the table.\n* Counteroffer 3 is greater than my outside offer, but could be risky if Player 1 values item 4 much more than I do.\n* Counteroffer 4 is worse than my outside offer, so it's a bad option.\n\nGiven that it's only round 1 and I want to aim for a good outcome, I will propose counteroffer 3 to test their response.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 2, 0]}\n```",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 939. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 939. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 858 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [7, 0, 3, 3, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    74 x 7 + 29 x 0 + 89 x 3 + 51 x 3 + 43 x 0\n    which is 938 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 939. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 0, 5, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 0, 0, 5, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

This means waiting reduces the value of any deal by 2% per round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [2, 0, 0, 5, 0]. This means I get 2 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.  My value for this offer is:\n    (2 * 74) + (0 * 29) + (0 * 89) + (5 * 51) + (0 * 43) = 148 + 0 + 0 + 255 + 0 = 403.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** 403 is less than my outside offer of 939.\n\n3) **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 939. The current offer on the table for me is: [2, 0, 0, 5, 0].\nThat means Player 1 is keeping [5, 0, 3, 0, 5].\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I keep all of items 1 and 3. That would leave me with 7 of item 1 and 3 of item 3. In this case, I offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n(7 * 74) + (0 * 29) + (3 * 89) + (0 * 51) + (0 * 43) = 518 + 0 + 267 + 0 + 0 = 785.\nThis is less than 939.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I give Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].

I offer Player 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n**Decision:**\n\nSince the current offer (403) is less than my outside offer (939), I should not accept it.\nOffering Player 1 everything ([7, 0, 3, 5, 5]) or nothing ([0, 0, 0, 0, 0]) is potentially suboptimal.\nSince I can make a counteroffer better than my outside offer (1255 > 939), I should make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

I need 939 total, so I need 939 - 785 = 154 more.\n    Item 5 would provide 154/43 = 3.58 units. So if I keep 4, then my total is 785 + 43*4 = 785+172 = 957.\n    Item 4 would provide 154/51 = 3.01 units. So if I keep 3, then my total is 785 + 51*3 = 785+153 = 938. Not quite enough.\n    So let's aim for keeping item 1 and item 3 plus some item 4.\n    To exceed the outside offer I should counteroffer [0, 0, 0, 0, 5].\n    My value is 7*74 + 3*89 + 5*43 = 518 + 267 + 215 = 1000, higher than my outside offer of 939.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 5]}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 0, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    69 x 0 + 98 x 3 + 21 x 0 + 25 x 2 + 67 x 2\n    which is 478 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 479. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

I should keep most of the high-value items for myself while giving enough to Player 2 to make it attractive.\n\nMy priorities based on value per unit:\n1. Item 1 (67) - highest value, keep most\n2. Item 2 (46) - second highest, keep most\n3. Item 4 (41) - third highest, keep most\n4. Item 5 (37) - fourth highest, keep some\n5.

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 479. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 479. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 840 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 0, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    69 x 0 + 98 x 3 + 21 x 0 + 25 x 2 + 67 x 2\n    which is 478 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 479. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 3, 3, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 0, 3, 5, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 3, 3, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 0, 3, 3, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Since this is round 1, the discount factor doesn't yet apply.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 1, 4, 3, 0]. This means they are giving me:\n      - 0 units of item 1\n      - 1 unit of item 2\n      - 4 units of item 3\n      - 3 units of item 4\n      - 0 units of item 5\n   - The value of this offer to me is: (0 * 73) + (1 * 52) + (4 * 47) + (3 * 18) + (0 * 95) = 0 + 52 + 188 + 54 + 0 = 294.\n   - This value (294) is less than my outside offer value (462).\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:**  I need to find a counteroffer that yields a value greater than 462. I will prioritize keeping items with high values for me (item 5, item 1, item 2, item 3, item 4 in that order).\n\n3) **Consider a potential counteroffer:** I will aim for an offer that exceeds my outside offer value. I will keep all the items I value highly, prioritizing keeping item 5 and item 1.\n    Let's try keeping [2, 4, 1, 0, 5]\n    My value would be:\n    73 * 2 + 52 * 4 + 47 * 1 + 18 * 0 + 95 * 5 = 146 + 208 + 47 + 0 + 475 = 876\n\n    The offer to player 1 will be [0, 1, 4, 6, 0]\n    Let's try keeping [2, 5, 5, 4, 5]\n    My value would be:\n    73 * 2 + 52 * 5 + 47 * 5 + 18 * 4 + 95 * 5 = 146 + 260 + 235 + 72 + 475 = 1188\n    The offer to player 1 will be [0, 0, 0, 2, 0]\n\n4) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   - Accepting the current offer (value 294) is worse than my outside offer (462).\n   - I want to make a counteroffer that gives me a value higher than my outside offer.\n\nLet's propose keeping all the items and offering player 1 nothing of item 1, item 2, item 3, item 5, and 2 of item 4.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 4, 4, 3, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    14 x 4 + 19 x 4 + 97 x 4 + 27 x 3 + 23 x 5\n    which is 716 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 717. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 4, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 4, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

My initial offer gave them more items, but I can try to find a middle ground that's still favorable to me but might be more acceptable to them.\n\nLet me make a slightly better counteroffer that gives them a bit more than their current request but less than my initial offer:\n\nI'll offer: [0, 1, 4, 1, 1]\nThis gives them 0 of item 1, 1 of item 2, all 4 of item 3 (which is low value to me), 1 of item 4, and 1 of item 5.\n\nMy value from this would be:\n(5\u00d774) + (3\u00d763) + (0\u00d73) + (4\u00d769) + (5\u00d794) = 370 + 189 + 0 + 276 + 470 = 1305\n\nWith the discount factor: 1305 \u00d7 0.98 = 1278.9\n\nThis is still much better than my outside offer and slightly worse than accepting their current offer, but it might result in a successful negotiation.\n\nOn second thought, Player 2's offer is already very good for me, and counteroffering introduces a risk that we might not reach agreement. Since we're already in round 2, we have only one more round after this, and further delays will reduce our final value due to the discount factor.\n\nI'll accept their current offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 2, 6, 3, 7] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    27 x 5 + 52 x 2 + 72 x 6 + 83 x 3 + 100 x 7\n    which is 1620 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1628. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [4, 0, 6, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [4, 0, 6, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

The discount factor influences the value of accepting versus waiting because the longer the negotiation takes, the lower the value of the final outcome.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer: I am being offered [4, 0, 6, 1, 1].

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 1628. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1628. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1002 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 2, 6, 3, 7] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    27 x 5 + 52 x 2 + 72 x 6 + 83 x 3 + 100 x 7\n    which is 1620 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1628. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [4, 0, 6, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 6, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 0, 6, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 1628.\n   - My values for the items are: item 1 = 27, item 2 = 52, item 3 = 72, item 4 = 83, item 5 = 100.\n   - The total pool of items is: 5 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 7 of item 3, 3 of item 4, 7 of item 5.\n   - The discount factor is 0.98. This means that accepting an offer in round 2 gives me 0.98 times the value of the items, and accepting in round 3 gives me 0.98^2 times the value of the items.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** I am being offered [2, 0, 6, 1, 1]. This means I would get:\n      - 2 units of item 1 * 27 = 54\n      - 0 units of item 2 * 52 = 0\n      - 6 units of item 3 * 72 = 432\n      - 1 unit of item 4 * 83 = 83\n      - 1 unit of item 5 * 100 = 100\n      - Total value = 54 + 0 + 432 + 83 + 100 = 669\n      Since this is round 2, the discounted value is 669 * 0.98 = 655.62.  This is much less than my outside offer of 1628.\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** I want to find a counteroffer that gives me more than 1628 / 0.98 = 1661.22.\n\nLet's consider keeping all the items for myself and offering nothing:\n- Value of keeping all items: (5 * 27) + (2 * 52) + (7 * 72) + (3 * 83) + (7 * 100) = 135 + 104 + 504 + 249 + 700 = 1692\n\nSince the total value of the items is 1692, any offer where I give away *anything* will result in a total value less than 1692.  Thus, keeping everything gives me a better return than walking away, and so that will be the basis of my offer this round.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - Accepting the current offer is worth 655.62, which is much less than my outside offer of 1628.\n   - Walking away gives me 1628.\n   - A counteroffer where I keep everything for myself and offer nothing to Player 1 would give me a value of 1692. However, since it is round 2, the discounted value is 1692 * 0.98 = 1658.16. This is more than my outside option of 1628.\n\nI'll make a counteroffer. The other player offered me [2, 0, 6, 1, 1]. That means they are keeping [3, 2, 1, 2, 6] for themselves.\n\nTo be more effective, I am going to ask for just a little bit less than the maximum possible value.\n\nCounteroffer: Give the other player [1, 0, 4, 0, 0].\nThis means I keep [4, 2, 3, 3, 7], which has a value of (4 * 27) + (2 * 52) + (3 * 72) + (3 * 83) + (7 * 100) = 108 + 104 + 216 + 249 + 700 = 1377.\nDiscounted value = 1377 * 0.98 = 1359.46, which is worse than my outside offer.\n\nCounteroffer: Give the other player [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\nThis means I keep [5, 2, 7, 3, 7], which has a value of (5 * 27) + (2 * 52) + (7 * 72) + (3 * 83) + (7 * 100) = 135 + 104 + 504 + 249 + 700 = 1692.\nDiscounted value = 1692 * 0.98 = 1658.16.\n\nThis is better than my outside offer.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 417. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1080 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 3, 0, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    93 x 0 + 86 x 1 + 82 x 3 + 78 x 0 + 21 x 4\n    which is 416 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 417. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 4, 0, 3, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 4, 0, 3, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 7, 2, 4, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    71 x 0 + 9 x 7 + 25 x 2 + 69 x 4 + 5 x 1\n    which is 394 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 395. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

My values per item:\n   - Item 1: 60 per unit (5 units total) = 300 total value\n   - Item 2: 68 per unit (8 units total) = 544 total value\n   - Item 3: 88 per unit (5 units total) = 440 total value\n   - Item 4: 79 per unit (5 units total) = 395 total value\n   - Item 5: 89 per unit (8 units total) = 712 total value\n   \n   Total potential value: 2,391\n\n2. My outside offer is 1,854, which is quite high (about 77.5% of my total potential value).\n\n3. Since this is a three-round negotiation with a discount factor of 0.98, each round reduces the value slightly.\n\n4. For my opening offer, I want to keep most of the high-value items for myself while offering Player 2 enough to make it worth their consideration.\n\n5. I don't know Player 2's values, but I should assume they are also trying to maximize their utility.\n\nGiven my high outside offer (1,854), I'm in a fairly strong position and don't need to give up too much. I'll propose an offer where I keep most of the higher-value items for myself:\n\n- I'll offer 2 units of item 1 (keeping 3 for myself)\n- I'll offer 3 units of item 2 (keeping 5 for myself)\n- I'll offer 1 unit of item 3 (keeping 4 for myself)\n- I'll offer 2 units of item 4 (keeping 3 for myself)\n- I'll offer 2 units of item 5 (keeping 6 for myself)\n\nThis means I'm offering [2, 3, 1, 2, 2] to Player 2.\n\nLet me calculate what I keep:\n- 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 60 = 180\n- 5 units of item 2 = 5 \u00d7 68 = 340\n- 4 units of item 3 = 4 \u00d7 88 = 352\n- 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237\n- 6 units of item 5 = 6 \u00d7 89 = 534\n\nTotal value for me: 1,643\n\nThis is less than my outside offer of 1,854, so I need to adjust my offer to keep more value.\n\nLet me revise:\n- I'll offer 1 unit of item 1 (keeping 4 for myself)\n- I'll offer 2 units of item 2 (keeping 6 for myself)\n- I'll offer 1 unit of item 3 (keeping 4 for myself)\n- I'll offer 1 unit of item 4 (keeping 4 for myself)\n- I'll offer 2 units of item 5 (keeping 6 for myself)\n\nMy revised value calculation:\n- 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 60 = 240\n- 6 units of item 2 = 6 \u00d7 68 = 408\n- 4 units of item 3 = 4 \u00d7 88 = 352\n- 4 units of item 4 = 4 \u00d7 79 = 316\n- 6 units of item 5 = 6 \u00d7 89 = 534\n\nTotal value for me: 1,850\n\nThis is still slightly less than my outside offer, but considering the discount factor of 0.98, I would need an even higher value to make negotiation worthwhile. I'll offer even less to Player 2:\n\nI'll propose [1, 1, 0, 1, 1], meaning I keep most items.\n\nFinal calculation of what I keep:\n- 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 60 = 240\n- 7 units of item 2 = 7 \u00d7 68 = 476\n- 5 units of item 3 = 5 \u00d7 88 = 440\n- 4 units of item 4 = 4 \u00d7 79 = 316\n- 7 units of item 5 = 7 \u00d7 89 = 623\n\nTotal value for me: 2,095\n\nThis is above my outside offer and gives me a good starting position for negotiation.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 1, 1]}",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 2, 3, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    45 x 0 + 58 x 1 + 28 x 2 + 16 x 3 + 93 x 0\n    which is 162 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 163. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Current Situation:**\n\n   - My outside offer value: 702\n   - Item values: Item 1 = 53, Item 2 = 44, Item 3 = 16, Item 4 = 43, Item 5 = 47\n   - Total items: Item 1 = 6, Item 2 = 1, Item 3 = 7, Item 4 = 5, Item 5 = 1\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.98.  This means that waiting a round reduces the value of any deal by a factor of 0.98.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer:** I am offered [1, 0, 3, 3, 1]. This means I keep:\n      - Item 1: 1 unit\n      - Item 2: 0 unit\n      - Item 3: 3 units\n      - Item 4: 3 units\n      - Item 5: 1 unit\n\nI keep 6 - 1 = 5 units of item 1\nI keep 1 - 0 = 1 unit of item 2\nI keep 7 - 3 = 4 units of item 3\nI keep 5 - 3 = 2 units of item 4\nI keep 1 - 1 = 0 units of item 5\n\nMy value if I accept the current offer:\n(5 * 53) + (1 * 44) + (4 * 16) + (2 * 43) + (0 * 47) = 265 + 44 + 64 + 86 + 0 = 459\n\n   - **Comparison to outside offer:** My value if I accept (459) is less than my outside offer (702).  Therefore, accepting is not a good idea.\n\n   - **Potential Counteroffers:**  I need to find an offer where the items I keep are worth more than 702. I also need to consider that there are 3 rounds of negotiation and the discount rate. Let's consider a counteroffer where I give Player 1 very little and see if it is better than walking away:\n      Let's try giving the Player 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I keep everything.\nMy value would be:\n(6 * 53) + (1 * 44) + (7 * 16) + (5 * 43) + (1 * 47) = 318 + 44 + 112 + 215 + 47 = 736\nThis is greater than my outside offer of 702. So, I want to make a counteroffer that is closer to this offer rather than accepting the current offer.\n\n3) **Decision:**\nI will make a counteroffer. I can improve my position by offering Player 1 a small amount of items.\nI will try offering Player 1: [1, 0, 2, 2, 0]\nThis means I keep 5 items of item 1, 1 item of item 2, 5 items of item 3, 3 items of item 4, and 1 item of item 5.\nThis gives me a value of:\n(5 * 53) + (1 * 44) + (5 * 16) + (3 * 43) + (1 * 47) = 265 + 44 + 80 + 129 + 47 = 565\n\nSince this is less than my outside offer, let's try offering Player 1: [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]\nThis means I keep 6 items of item 1, 1 item of item 2, 6 items of item 3, 4 items of item 4, and 1 item of item 5.\nThis gives me a value of:\n(6 * 53) + (1 * 44) + (6 * 16) + (4 * 43) + (1 * 47) = 318 + 44 + 96 + 172 + 47 = 677\n\nThis is also less than my outside offer. However it is getting closer, so it may be a better strategy in the long run given the discount factor.\n\nLet's try giving only 1 item of item 3: [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\nThis means I keep 6 items of item 1, 1 item of item 2, 6 items of item 3, 5 items of item 4, and 1 item of item 5.\nThis gives me a value of:\n(6 * 53) + (1 * 44) + (6 * 16) + (5 * 43) + (1 * 47) = 318 + 44 + 96 + 215 + 47 = 720\nThis value is now greater than my outside offer.\n\nSo I'll make this my offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [6, 1, 7, 4, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    53 x 6 + 44 x 1 + 16 x 7 + 43 x 4 + 47 x 1\n    which is 693 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 702. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 3, 3, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 3, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 3, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value is 702.\n*   My values for the items are: item 1: 53, item 2: 44, item 3: 16, item 4: 43, item 5: 47.\n*   The total pool of items is: item 1: 6, item 2: 1, item 3: 7, item 4: 5, item 5: 1.\n*   The discount factor is 0.98. This means that accepting an offer in a later round is slightly less valuable than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [1, 0, 3, 2, 1].  This means I keep: item 1: 6 - 1 = 5, item 2: 1 - 0 = 1, item 3: 7 - 3 = 4, item 4: 5 - 2 = 3, item 5: 1 - 1 = 0.\n    My value if I accept the current offer is: (5 * 53) + (1 * 44) + (4 * 16) + (3 * 43) + (0 * 47) = 265 + 44 + 64 + 129 + 0 = 502.\n\n*   Since 502 is less than my outside offer of 702, accepting the current offer would be a mistake (Mistake 4). I need to consider a counteroffer or walking away.\n\nLet's try to find a beneficial counteroffer. I need to ensure the value I keep is greater than 702.\n\nI will start by calculating the maximum possible value:\n(6 * 53) + (1 * 44) + (7 * 16) + (5 * 43) + (1 * 47) = 318 + 44 + 112 + 215 + 47 = 736\n\nNow I need to offer Player 1 some items such that the value I keep is greater than 702.\n\n*Strategy:* Give away items I value the least first. I value item 3 the least at 16. Let's try giving all of item 3 to Player 1, and keep the rest.\nMy offer would be [0, 0, 7, 0, 0]. Then I keep: item 1: 6, item 2: 1, item 3: 0, item 4: 5, item 5: 1.\nValue = (6 * 53) + (1 * 44) + (0 * 16) + (5 * 43) + (1 * 47) = 318 + 44 + 0 + 215 + 47 = 624. This is still less than 702.\n\nLet's try giving all of item 3 and all of item 4 to Player 1.\nMy offer would be [0, 0, 7, 5, 0]. Then I keep: item 1: 6, item 2: 1, item 3: 0, item 4: 0, item 5: 1.\nValue = (6 * 53) + (1 * 44) + (0 * 16) + (0 * 43) + (1 * 47) = 318 + 44 + 0 + 0 + 47 = 409. This is still less than 702.\n\nThe maximum I can get is 736, and my outside offer is 702. It looks like in order to get the most value from a deal I would have to offer player 1 such little value that they would WALK. Given that, I believe I will also WALK.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince I can't construct a counteroffer better than my outside offer for me and still likely acceptable for Player 1 and my current offer is also worse, I will walk away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 862. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 862. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 990 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 3, 2, 2, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    55 x 4 + 99 x 3 + 88 x 2 + 83 x 2 + 5 x 0\n    which is 859 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 862. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 1, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 0, 1, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

This means that waiting to a later round reduces the value of any deal by a factor of 0.98 per round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [2, 0, 1, 1, 2].

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 2, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    11 x 1 + 50 x 1 + 2 x 2 + 10 x 1 + 88 x 1\n    which is 163 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 164. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 0, 0, 0, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 0, 0, 0, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 2, 3, 0, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    27 x 2 + 63 x 2 + 74 x 3 + 36 x 0 + 5 x 5\n    which is 427 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 429. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 1, 0, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 1, 0, 3]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 429\n*   My item values: item 1 = 27, item 2 = 63, item 3 = 74, item 4 = 36, item 5 = 5\n*   Total items: 3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 6 units of item 5\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.98. This means that accepting an offer in a later round is slightly less valuable than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   Current offer: Player 1 is offering me [0, 2, 1, 0, 3]. This means I would receive:\n    *   0 units of item 1\n    *   2 units of item 2\n    *   1 unit of item 3\n    *   0 units of item 4\n    *   3 units of item 5\n\n    My value for this offer is: (0 * 27) + (2 * 63) + (1 * 74) + (0 * 36) + (3 * 5) = 0 + 126 + 74 + 0 + 15 = 215\n\n    Comparing this to my outside offer: 215 < 429.  So, accepting this offer would be worse than walking away.\n\n*   Potential counteroffers: I need to find an offer that gives me a value greater than 429. Let's start by calculating my total possible value.\n    *   Total value of all items: (3 * 27) + (2 * 63) + (3 * 74) + (1 * 36) + (6 * 5) = 81 + 126 + 222 + 36 + 30 = 495\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince the current offer (215) is much worse than my outside offer (429), I should not accept it. Offering Player 1 all of the items will also not be beneficial. The discount rate is small at this stage and does not have a large effect on decision making. Now I must propose a counteroffer.\n\nTo avoid mistake 2 (making an offer worse for me than my outside offer), I want to end up with a value of at least 429. This means I can only offer player 1 a maximum of 495-429=66 of value. I need to figure out a division of items that gives me at least 429, and therefore leaves the opponent with less than 66. This is difficult without knowing Player 1's preferences.\n\nI will try to take all of item 3 and item 2 as it is high value, then as much as I can of Item 1 and Item 4.\nIf I take all of item 2 and item 3 and item 4. I need (429-63*2 - 74*3 - 36*1)=429-126-222-36=45 to make my outside option. Each Item 1 is worth 27 so I need all of Item 1. Which would make total value:\n63*2 + 74*3 + 36*1 +27*3 = 126 + 222 + 36 + 81 = 465\nSo, if I offer player 1 no items of type 2, 3 or 4, then they get 0. The remaining value is 495-465 = 30\n495 - 30 = 465> 429, so I can make a counteroffer and stay above my outside option.\n\nThis means I offer [0,0,0,0,6] and keep 3,2,3,1,0. I have a total value 465.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 6]}\n",

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 1, 0, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 6]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 2, 0, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 2, 0, 4]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action for Player 2.\n\n1. **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n   - My outside offer value: 429\n   - My item values: Item 1: 27, Item 2: 63, Item 3: 74, Item 4: 36, Item 5: 5\n   - Total items: Item 1: 3, Item 2: 2, Item 3: 3, Item 4: 1, Item 5: 6\n   - Discount factor: 0.98. This means that waiting for a future offer reduces the value by a factor of 0.98.\n\n2. **Assess the value of the current offer:**\n\n   - Current offer: [0, 2, 2, 0, 4] (This is what Player 1 is offering *me*)\n   - My value of the current offer:\n     (0 * 27) + (2 * 63) + (2 * 74) + (0 * 36) + (4 * 5) = 0 + 126 + 148 + 0 + 20 = 294\n\n3. **Compare the current offer to my outside offer:**\n\n   - The current offer's value (294) is less than my outside offer (429). Therefore, accepting this offer would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\n\n4. **Consider a potential counteroffer:**\n\n   I need to calculate what I would get if I keep a certain amount of items and compare the total value to my outside offer. I should be aiming for a value significantly greater than my outside offer, to accommodate the possibility that Player 1 may reject this and I will need to make a slightly less favorable offer in Round 3 (potentially at a further discounted rate).\n\nLet's consider several scenarios.\nFirst, let's examine what it would be worth to keep everything for myself:\n3 * 27 + 2 * 63 + 3 * 74 + 1 * 36 + 6 * 5 = 81 + 126 + 222 + 36 + 30 = 495\nIf I offer [0,0,0,0,0] my value would be 495\nIf I offer [1,0,0,0,0] my value would be 495 - 27 = 468\nIf I offer [0,1,0,0,0] my value would be 495 - 63 = 432\nIf I offer [0,0,1,0,0] my value would be 495 - 74 = 421\nIf I offer [0,0,0,1,0] my value would be 495 - 36 = 459\nIf I offer [0,0,0,0,1] my value would be 495 - 5 = 490\nSince my outside offer is 429, I would ideally be making counteroffers which result in a value above 429 for myself, so as not to fall into mistakes 2 and 4.\nThe other player offered me [0, 2, 2, 0, 4]. I can improve on this outcome.\n\nLet's try offering Player 1 all of items 2 and 3, and one of item 5, keeping the remaining items:\nOffering [0, 2, 3, 0, 1] to Player 1\nKeeping [3, 0, 0, 1, 5] for myself\nValue = (3 * 27) + (0 * 63) + (0 * 74) + (1 * 36) + (5 * 5) = 81 + 0 + 0 + 36 + 25 = 142\n\nThis offer would be terrible for me, as my value is much lower than my outside offer, so I reject this approach.\n\nI will make a counteroffer that provides me with value greater than my outside offer, while also improving on Player 1's previous offer to me. This will mean offering less to Player 1 overall than I did in the previous round.\nHow about offering player 1: [0, 1, 1, 0, 2]? This means keeping [3, 1, 2, 1, 4]\nValue to me: 3 * 27 + 1 * 63 + 2 * 74 + 1 * 36 + 4 * 5 = 81 + 63 + 148 + 36 + 20 = 348\n\nThis is still not good enough. I will try something else.\n\nHow about offering player 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5]? This means keeping [3, 2, 3, 1, 1]\nValue to me: 3 * 27 + 2 * 63 + 3 * 74 + 1 * 36 + 1 * 5 = 81 + 126 + 222 + 36 + 5 = 470. This exceeds my outside offer of 429.\n\nI will make this counteroffer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 5]}\n",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [6, 3, 2, 3, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    36 x 6 + 45 x 3 + 55 x 2 + 73 x 3 + 85 x 1\n    which is 765 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 766. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [4, 2, 0, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [4, 2, 0, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step to determine the best action in this negotiation.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 766\n*   **Item values:** Item 1 = 36, Item 2 = 45, Item 3 = 55, Item 4 = 73, Item 5 = 85\n*   **Total item pool:** 6 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.98. This means that accepting an offer in later rounds is slightly less valuable than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [4, 2, 0, 1, 0]. This means I would receive 4 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n    *   Value of current offer: (4 * 36) + (2 * 45) + (0 * 55) + (1 * 73) + (0 * 85) = 144 + 90 + 0 + 73 + 0 = 307\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (307) is significantly less than my outside offer (766). Therefore, accepting this offer would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\n\n3) **Consider a counteroffer:**\n\nSince accepting is not a good option, I need to decide between walking away or making a counteroffer. Making a counteroffer can be better if I can get more value than my outside offer, even considering the discount factor in later rounds.\n\nLet's try to construct a counteroffer. My goal is to maximize my value. I want to keep the items I value most. The values are: Item 5 > Item 4 > Item 3 > Item 2 > Item 1. I'll start by keeping all of item 5, then item 4, then item 3 and see what that gives me.\nLet's start by trying to keep as much as possible:\n\n*   Offer Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]: This means I keep [6, 4, 2, 3, 1].\n    *   Value: (6 * 36) + (4 * 45) + (2 * 55) + (3 * 73) + (1 * 85) = 216 + 180 + 110 + 219 + 85 = 810\n\nThis offer is significantly better than my outside offer. However, it's likely Player 1 will reject it. So let's make a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer, but potentially more palatable to Player 1. It's worth remembering I have three rounds, so I can ask for a large percentage of the items.\n\nLet's offer Player 1 the following [2, 1, 0, 0, 0]:\nThis means I keep [4, 3, 2, 3, 1].\n* Value to me: (4 * 36) + (3 * 45) + (2 * 55) + (3 * 73) + (1 * 85) = 144 + 135 + 110 + 219 + 85 = 693\n\nThis is worse than my outside offer. Let's increase my offer by giving them one less of item 1, and keep one more.\n\nLet's offer Player 1 the following [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]:\nThis means I keep [5, 3, 2, 3, 1].\n* Value to me: (5 * 36) + (3 * 45) + (2 * 55) + (3 * 73) + (1 * 85) = 180 + 135 + 110 + 219 + 85 = 729\n\nStill worse than my outside offer. Let's offer Player 1 the following [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]:\nThis means I keep [6, 3, 2, 3, 1].\n* Value to me: (6 * 36) + (3 * 45) + (2 * 55) + (3 * 73) + (1 * 85) = 216 + 135 + 110 + 219 + 85 = 765\n\nAlmost there! Let's offer Player 1 the following [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]:\nThis means I keep [6, 4, 2, 3, 1].\n* Value to me: (6 * 36) + (4 * 45) + (2 * 55) + (3 * 73) + (1 * 85) = 216 + 180 + 110 + 219 + 85 = 810\n\nThis is greater than my outside offer.\n**Decision:**\n\nThe current offer is much worse than my outside offer. Offering Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] means that I get a value of 810.\n\nTherefore, my action is to make a counteroffer.\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 4, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    28 x 0 + 16 x 0 + 51 x 1 + 41 x 4 + 25 x 1\n    which is 240 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 241. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 2, 5, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 2, 5, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

This means that offers in later rounds are worth slightly less to me.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 0, 2, 5, 3].  This means I would receive:\n      - 1 unit of item 1\n      - 0 units of item 2\n      - 2 units of item 3\n      - 5 units of item 4\n      - 3 units of item 5\n\n      My value for this offer is: (1 * 28) + (0 * 16) + (2 * 51) + (5 * 41) + (3 * 25) = 28 + 0 + 102 + 205 + 75 = 410\n\n   - **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (410) is significantly better than my outside offer (241).\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what counteroffers would be better than my outside offer and potentially better than the current offer. Let's think about how the current offer affects the item distribution. I would receive [1, 0, 2, 5, 3], meaning Player 1 receives [2, 4, 6, 1, 4].\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - The current offer is much better than my outside offer. Therefore, I should not WALK.\n   - Accepting the current offer gives me a value of 410. I want to consider if there's a reasonable counteroffer I can make that could yield a higher value, knowing that it would be discounted by 0.98 in the next round if Player 1 rejects it.\n\nSince the current offer is quite good, I won't get too greedy. I'll try to improve it slightly, but not so much that Player 1 will definitely reject it. I will consider giving Player 1 one less of item 4, since my valuation of item 4 is relatively high at 41. This means I would get 6 units instead of 5. The counteroffer I will give will be [1,0,2,4,3].\n\nRevised value for this new offer: (1 * 28) + (0 * 16) + (2 * 51) + (6 * 41) + (3 * 25) = 28 + 0 + 102 + 246 + 75 = 451\n\nThis is better than the original offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 2, 4, 3]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    95 x 0 + 25 x 2 + 92 x 0 + 61 x 0 + 77 x 0\n    which is 50 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 59. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 3, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 3, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 59\n*   My values for the items: item 1: 95, item 2: 25, item 3: 92, item 4: 61, item 5: 77\n*   Total pool of items: 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 3 units of item 5.\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.98. This means that offers in later rounds are worth slightly less.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 0, 3, 0, 0]. This means I would receive 1 unit of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n    My value if I accept: (1 * 95) + (0 * 25) + (3 * 92) + (0 * 61) + (0 * 77) = 95 + 0 + 276 + 0 + 0 = 371.\n    This is significantly better than my outside offer.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what I would keep and what I would offer to Player 1. My goal is to maximize my value, but also consider that Player 1 needs to get something they value or they will walk.\n\n    Let's analyze some scenarios to see if a counteroffer would be better:\n    If I offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], then I keep [3, 3, 4, 1, 3]. My value would be (3*95) + (3*25) + (4*92) + (1*61) + (3*77) = 285 + 75 + 368 + 61 + 231 = 1020. This is the maximum I can get, but unrealistic because Player 1 will likely walk.\n\n    The current offer gives me a value of 371. That leaves Player 1 with 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Accepting the current offer is much better than my outside offer (371 > 59).\n*   Trying to get everything (value 1020) is probably not realistic.\n*   Before making a counteroffer, I need to think if I can get an even better offer, while still making the deal attractive to Player 1. However, accepting now means I get 371 immediately, which is quite good.\n\nGiven that the current offer is significantly better than my outside offer, and considering the discount factor, I will accept the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 5, 1, 3, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    67 x 1 + 74 x 5 + 34 x 1 + 72 x 3 + 87 x 5\n    which is 1122 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1123. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 1, 3, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 3, 1, 3, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best course of action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 1123\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 67, Item 2: 74, Item 3: 34, Item 4: 72, Item 5: 87\n*   **Total items:** Item 1: 5, Item 2: 6, Item 3: 6, Item 4: 4, Item 5: 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.98. This means that later rounds are worth slightly less.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am offered [1, 3, 1, 3, 1].

Accepting the current offer is much worse than my outside offer.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**  I need to find an offer where the value of the items I keep is greater than 1123.\n\nLet's try to calculate the value if I keep most of the items. Suppose I offer Player 1 [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. Then I keep [4, 5, 5, 3, 4]\nMy value = (4 * 67) + (5 * 74) + (5 * 34) + (3 * 72) + (4 * 87) = 268 + 370 + 170 + 216 + 348 = 1372\n\nSince 1372 > 1123, this counteroffer is better than walking away immediately.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is unacceptable.

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 668. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 668. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 852 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 3, 0, 4, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    1 x 1 + 76 x 3 + 78 x 0 + 90 x 4 + 39 x 2\n    which is 667 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 668. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 6, 0, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 6, 0, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best course of action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 668\n*   **My values of the items:** Item 1: 1, Item 2: 76, Item 3: 78, Item 4: 90, Item 5: 39\n*   **Total pool of items:** Item 1: 4, Item 2: 6, Item 3: 2, Item 4: 6, Item 5: 2\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.98. This means that accepting an offer in a later round is slightly less valuable than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [1, 6, 0, 0, 1]. This means I get:\n    *   Item 1: 1 unit\n    *   Item 2: 6 units\n    *   Item 3: 0 units\n    *   Item 4: 0 units\n    *   Item 5: 1 unit\n    My value for this offer is (1 * 1) + (6 * 76) + (0 * 78) + (0 * 90) + (1 * 39) = 1 + 456 + 0 + 0 + 39 = 496\n\n*   **Comparing to outside offer:** The current offer (496) is less than my outside offer (668). Therefore, accepting this offer would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find an offer that gives me a value greater than 668. Let's start by considering an offer that gives Player 1 relatively little, then adjust. The total amount of items I own is [4, 6, 2, 6, 2].\n\n    Here is an example offer to Player 1, where I give: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    Therefore, I keep [4, 6, 2, 6, 2].\n    My value for this is (4 * 1) + (6 * 76) + (2 * 78) + (6 * 90) + (2 * 39) = 4 + 456 + 156 + 540 + 78 = 1234\n\n    I need to make an offer where what I keep for myself is worth more than 668.\n\n    Let's try offering Player 1: [1, 3, 1, 3, 1]. This leaves me with [3, 3, 1, 3, 1]\n    My value for this is (3 * 1) + (3 * 76) + (1 * 78) + (3 * 90) + (1 * 39) = 3 + 228 + 78 + 270 + 39 = 618\n\n    Since 618 is smaller than 668, this is not a good offer.\n\n    Let's try offering Player 1: [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]. This leaves me with [4, 5, 2, 5, 2]\n    My value for this is (4 * 1) + (5 * 76) + (2 * 78) + (5 * 90) + (2 * 39) = 4 + 380 + 156 + 450 + 78 = 1068\n\n    Since 1068 is greater than 668, this is a good offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is worse than my outside offer.\n*   I've calculated a counteroffer that yields a higher value than my outside offer.\n*   Therefore, I should propose the counteroffer.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 1, 3, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    33 x 0 + 85 x 1 + 5 x 1 + 60 x 3 + 16 x 0\n    which is 270 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 271. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 3, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 3, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n   - My outside offer value is 271.\n   - My values for items 1-5 are 33, 85, 5, 60, 16 respectively.\n   - The total pool of items is 2 units of item 1, 9 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor is 0.98. This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 98% of its value in round 1, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 96.04% of its value in round 1. This encourages me to accept good offers sooner rather than later, but also to try and get a better deal if the current one is not good enough.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer:** I am being offered [0, 0, 0, 3, 1]. This means I get 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5. My value for this offer is:\n     (0 * 33) + (0 * 85) + (0 * 5) + (3 * 60) + (1 * 16) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 180 + 16 = 196\n   - 196 is less than my outside offer of 271. Therefore, accepting this offer would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** I need to make a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 271. Let's try to figure out a good counteroffer. I want to keep items that I value highly. Since I value item 2 the most, I want to secure a good number of those. Item 4 is next, then Item 1. Item 3 is next, then 5. I need to calculate my keeping value from different offers. I need to offer the other player something, but I do not want to offer them too much.\n   - Since the other player offered me 0 of Items 1, 2, and 3 I will make sure to keep those, and give him the remaining Items 4 and 5 in a counteroffer.\n\n   - What if I offer [2, 9, 1, 0, 0]? This means the other player gets 2 units of item 1, 9 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5. My keeping value would then be:\n       0*33 + 0*85 + 0*5 + 3*60 + 4*16 = 0 + 0 + 0 + 180 + 64 = 244\n   - Since my keeping value of 244 is lower than my outside offer of 271, I will not propose that offer.\n\n   - What if I offer [0, 7, 0, 0, 0]? This means the other player gets 0 units of item 1, 7 units of item 2, 0 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5. My keeping value would then be:\n       2*33 + 2*85 + 1*5 + 3*60 + 4*16 = 66 + 170 + 5 + 180 + 64 = 485\n   - Since my keeping value of 485 is greater than my outside offer of 271, I will check the keeping value of the other player to decide on an offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   - I should not accept the current offer.\n   - I should not walk away yet.\n   - I should propose a counteroffer.\n\nI will offer [0, 7, 0, 0, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 7, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

                    "response": "I need to carefully analyze the current offer and determine my best move for round 2.\n\nLet me evaluate the current offer from Player 2:\n- They're offering me 7 units of item 2\n- Value to me: 7 \u00d7 64 = 448\n\nIf I keep the rest, I would have:\n- 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 87 = 174\n- 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 64 = 128\n- 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 93 = 93\n- 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 22 = 66\n- 4 units of item 5: 4 \u00d7 37 = 148\n\nTotal value if I accept: 174 + 128 + 93 + 66 + 148 + 448 = 1057 (with discount: 1057 \u00d7 0.98 = 1035.86)\n\nMy outside offer is 971, so accepting would be better than walking away.\n\nHowever, I should try for a better deal. Looking at Player 2's previous response, they rejected my offer of [0, 0, 0, 3, 1] and countered with [0, 7, 0, 0, 0], which suggests they value item 2 less than I do.\n\nLet me try a counteroffer where I keep my high-value items (1 and 3) and give some of the lower-value items:\n- Keep all of item 1 (2 units, valuable to me at 87 each)\n- Keep all of item 3 (1 unit, valuable to me at 93)\n- Keep 4 units of item 2 (value 64 each)\n- Give 5 units of item 2\n- Give all of item 4 (3 units, only worth 22 each to me)\n- Give 2 units of item 5, keep 2 units\n\nMy counteroffer: [0, 5, 0, 3, 2]\n\nLet me verify my value if this counteroffer is accepted:\n- 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 87 = 174\n- 4 units of item 2: 4 \u00d7 64 = 256\n- 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 93 = 93\n- 0 units of item 4: 0\n- 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 37 = 74\n\nTotal value: 597 (with discount next round: 585.06)\n\nThis would be worse than my outside offer of 971, so this isn't a good counteroffer.\n\nLet me try a different approach - I'll offer slightly more than last time but still keep most of my high-value items:\n- Keep all of item 1 (2 units)\n- Give 4 units of item 2, keep 5 units\n- Keep all of item 3 (1 unit)\n- Give all of item 4 (3 units)\n- Give 2 units of item 5, keep 2 units\n\nMy counteroffer: [0, 4, 0, 3, 2]\n\nThis gives me: \n- 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 87 = 174\n- 5 units of item 2: 5 \u00d7 64 = 320\n- 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 93 = 93\n- 0 units of item 4: 0\n- 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 37 = 74\n\nTotal value: 661 (with discount next round: 647.78)\n\nThis is still well below my outside offer of 971.\n\nSince we're already in round 2, and my outside offer (971) is very close to my maximum possible value (1057), I should walk away rather than make a counteroffer that would leave me with less value than my outside offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",
