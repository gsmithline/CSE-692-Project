                    "response": "Okay, let's start by assessing the situation. It's round 1, and there's no offer on the table. My outside offer is 446. I need to make an initial offer to Player 2. My goal is to maximize my expected value, taking into account the discount factor and the possibility of Player 2 rejecting my offer.\n\nMy values for each item are:\nItem 1: 92 (1 unit)\nItem 2: 57 (3 units)\nItem 3: 47 (1 unit)\nItem 4: 52 (3 units)\nItem 5: 95 (1 unit)\n\nTotal value: 92 + (3 * 57) + 47 + (3 * 52) + 95 = 92 + 171 + 47 + 156 + 95 = 561\n\nSince it's round 1, I should start with a somewhat aggressive offer, leaving room for negotiation. I will make an offer where player 2 gets slightly more than half the value, aiming for a deal where I get more than my outside offer after discounting in later rounds. It is difficult to reason about player 2's private values, I will start with an offer where they get ~60% of the total value by giving them 60% of each item.\n\nHere's how I'll construct the offer:\nItem 1: I have 1 unit. I'll offer 0.6 units to player 2, meaning I keep 0.4\nItem 2: I have 3 units. I'll offer 1.8 units to player 2, meaning I keep 1.2\nItem 3: I have 1 unit. I'll offer 0.6 units to player 2, meaning I keep 0.4\nItem 4: I have 3 units. I'll offer 1.8 units to player 2, meaning I keep 1.2\nItem 5: I have 1 unit. I'll offer 0.6 units to player 2, meaning I keep 0.4\n\nThe counter offer must be integers. Let us offer:\nItem 1: 1 unit to Player 2, I keep 0\nItem 2: 2 units to Player 2, I keep 1\nItem 3: 1 unit to Player 2, I keep 0\nItem 4: 2 units to Player 2, I keep 1\nItem 5: 1 unit to Player 2, I keep 0\n\nThe value to me is:\nItem 1: 0 * 92 = 0\nItem 2: 1 * 57 = 57\nItem 3: 0 * 47 = 0\nItem 4: 1 * 52 = 52\nItem 5: 0 * 95 = 0\nTotal value = 109\n\nThis is a terrible offer. Let me instead try to make a fair offer of 50% to player 2.\nItem 1: 1 unit.  I offer 0.5\nItem 2: 3 units. I offer 1.5\nItem 3: 1 unit. I offer 0.5\nItem 4: 3 units. I offer 1.5\nItem 5: 1 unit. I offer 0.5\n\nMust be an integer. Let me offer:\nItem 1: 0 unit to Player 2, I keep 1\nItem 2: 1 unit to Player 2, I keep 2\nItem 3: 0 unit to Player 2, I keep 1\nItem 4: 1 unit to Player 2, I keep 2\nItem 5: 0 unit to Player 2, I keep 1\n\nValue to me:\nItem 1: 1 * 92 = 92\nItem 2: 2 * 57 = 114\nItem 3: 1 * 47 = 47\nItem 4: 2 * 52 = 104\nItem 5: 1 * 95 = 95\n\nValue to me = 92+114+47+104+95 = 452\nThis is just above my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 2, 0, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    70 x 1 + 7 x 2 + 5 x 0 + 52 x 1 + 12 x 1\n    which is 148 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 149. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

My outside offer is 446.\n\nSince 161 < 446, accepting Player 2's offer would be worse than walking away *at this round*. However, this is round 2, so we need to factor in the discount rate gamma = 0.98.  If I walk away now, I get 446.  If I make a counteroffer and Player 2 accepts in Round 3 (which we have to treat as the only possibility for that round), then my value is discounted by 0.98^1 = 0.98.\n\nLet's consider a possible counteroffer. I want to maximize my utility, and I need to offer something that Player 2 might accept. If I give Player 2 everything that maximizes their value, and I get everything that maximizes *my* value, we might have a deal.\n\nPlayer 2 offered me [0, 2, 1, 0, 0]. That means they want to keep:\n- Item 1: 1\n- Item 2: 1\n- Item 3: 0\n- Item 4: 3\n- Item 5: 1\n\nI have a high value for items 1 and 5. Player 2 seems to value items 2 and 4. Let's aim for a fair split that gives me more of items 1 and 5. A completely fair split would be difficult, as there are odd numbers of items.\n\nHow about this counteroffer: I give Player 2 [1, 1, 0, 2, 0].\nThis means I keep:\n- Item 1: 0\n- Item 2: 2\n- Item 3: 1\n- Item 4: 1\n- Item 5: 1\n\nMy value would be: (0 * 92) + (2 * 57) + (1 * 47) + (1 * 52) + (1 * 95) = 0 + 114 + 47 + 52 + 95 = 308\nThis is less than my outside offer of 446, even before discounting. This is because my outside offer is quite high. However, if I walk, Player 2 gets their outside offer, too, so we both potentially lose value.\n\nMy outside offer is 446. If I accept Player 2's offer now, I get 161. If I walk, I get 446. If I make a counteroffer and they accept next round, I get (value)*0.98. Therefore, I must make them accept a counteroffer such that (value * 0.98) > 446, which means value > 446/0.98 which is approximately 455.\nHowever, I suspect Player 2 is rational and knows this, so they will only accept an offer that gives them more than *their* outside offer.\n\nSince it is Round 2, I should try to make a better offer, even if I am likely to walk in Round 3. If I counteroffer, and Player 2 accepts, I will get more than walking.\n\nLet's try an offer that gives them most of items 2 and 4.\n\nCOUNTEROFFER: [0, 1, 0, 3, 0]\n\nThat leaves me with:\n- Item 1: 1\n- Item 2: 2\n- Item 3: 1\n- Item 4: 0\n- Item 5: 1\nMy value: (1 * 92) + (2 * 57) + (1 * 47) + (0 * 52) + (1 * 95) = 92 + 114 + 47 + 0 + 95 = 348\n348 * 0.98 = 341.04 which is still worse than my outside offer of 446.\nHowever, it is round 2, and if I counteroffer and Player 2 rejects, the game ends (since Player 2 will WALK in round 3.) Thus, if my counteroffer is rejected, I get 446.\nThe value of making a deal on my outside offer is that Player 2 is less likely to walk to *their* outside offer!\nSince it is difficult to get over 455 * 0.98 = 446, I will walk.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Since it's the first round, I should make an offer that gives Player 2 enough to accept, but also leaves me with a significant portion of the items. I'll start by proposing a split that favors me, but is still reasonably attractive to Player 2, then adjust based on their response.\n\nMy private values are:\nItem 1: 52 (3 units)\nItem 2: 65 (5 units)\nItem 3: 89 (9 units)\nItem 4: 69 (5 units)\nItem 5: 52 (3 units)\nOutside offer: 349\n\nTotal value of all items to me: (3 * 52) + (5 * 65) + (9 * 89) + (5 * 69) + (3 * 52) = 156 + 325 + 801 + 345 + 156 = 1783\n\nLet's aim for a split where I get roughly 60% of the total value, and Player 2 gets 40%.  This means I want to keep items worth approximately 1070 (60% of 1783) for myself, and offer items worth approximately 713 to Player 2. I will achieve this by giving some units of each item to player 2. Since I highly value item 3, I want to keep most of it. I also value item 4 relatively high, so I want to retain most of it.\n\nHere's an initial offer I'll propose to Player 2:\nItem 1: 1 unit (value to me: 52)\nItem 2: 2 units (value to me: 130)\nItem 3: 3 units (value to me: 267)\nItem 4: 1 unit (value to me: 69)\nItem 5: 1 unit (value to me: 52)\nTotal value to me: 52 + 130 + 267 + 69 + 52 = 570.\n\nRemaining items for myself:\nItem 1: 2 units (value to me: 104)\nItem 2: 3 units (value to me: 195)\nItem 3: 6 units (value to me: 534)\nItem 4: 4 units (value to me: 276)\nItem 5: 2 units (value to me: 104)\nTotal value to myself: 104 + 195 + 534 + 276 + 104 = 1213\n\nLet's adjust the offer a little bit to get closer to the desired split and give Player 2 slightly better deal.\nItem 1: 1 unit (value to me: 52)\nItem 2: 3 units (value to me: 195)\nItem 3: 3 units (value to me: 267)\nItem 4: 1 unit (value to me: 69)\nItem 5: 1 unit (value to me: 52)\nTotal value to me: 52 + 195 + 267 + 69 + 52 = 635\n\nRemaining items for myself:\nItem 1: 2 units (value to me: 104)\nItem 2: 2 units (value to me: 130)\nItem 3: 6 units (value to me: 534)\nItem 4: 4 units (value to me: 276)\nItem 5: 2 units (value to me: 104)\nTotal value to myself: 104 + 130 + 534 + 276 + 104 = 1148\n\nThis is still slightly above my target, but better.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 3, 3, 1, 1]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 1, 5, 5, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    88 x 2 + 6 x 1 + 13 x 5 + 70 x 5 + 66 x 3\n    which is 795 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 796. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

So the total value of the current offer to me is:\n\n(0 * 52) + (5 * 65) + (4 * 89) + (1 * 69) + (0 * 52) = 0 + 325 + 356 + 69 + 0 = 750\n\nNow, I need to discount this value by the discount factor for round 2, which is gamma^(r-1) = 0.98^(2-1) = 0.98.\nSo, the present value of the current offer is 750 * 0.98 = 735.\n\nMy outside offer is worth 349. Since the current offer (735) is much better than my outside offer, it's beneficial for me to try to negotiate a better deal.\n\nIn round 1, I offered Player 2 [1, 3, 3, 1, 1]. Player 2 countered with [0, 5, 4, 1, 0].\nThis implies that Player 2 values item 2 and 3 more than I do.\n\nNow I need to decide whether to accept the current offer, walk away, or make a counteroffer. Since the current offer is better than my outside offer, I will try to make a counteroffer. I will try to get more of the items I value, particularly item 1, 4, and 5. I will also try to give player 2 slightly more of what they want (items 2 and 3), to make my counteroffer more appealing.\n\nLet's try offering Player 2 [0, 5, 4, 0, 0].\nThis means I would receive:\n*   3 units of item 1\n*   0 units of item 2\n*   5 units of item 3\n*   5 unit of item 4\n*   3 units of item 5\n\nThe total value of this offer to me is:\n(3 * 52) + (0 * 65) + (5 * 89) + (5 * 69) + (3 * 52) = 156 + 0 + 445 + 345 + 156 = 1102\n\nDiscounted value in round 2: 1102 * 0.98 = 1079.96\n\nLet's try a slightly more generous offer to Player 2 [0, 4, 4, 0, 0]\nThis means I would receive:\n*   3 units of item 1\n*   1 units of item 2\n*   5 units of item 3\n*   5 unit of item 4\n*   3 units of item 5\n\nThe total value of this offer to me is:\n(3 * 52) + (1 * 65) + (5 * 89) + (5 * 69) + (3 * 52) = 156 + 65 + 445 + 345 + 156 = 1167\n\nDiscounted value in round 2: 1167 * 0.98 = 1143.66\n\nSince the current offer is better than my outside offer, and I want to maximize my gains, I will try a counteroffer which benefits me more. Given the offers in the first round, I will offer more of item 2 and 3 to Player 2.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 4, 4, 0, 0]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 796. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 729 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 1, 5, 5, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    88 x 2 + 6 x 1 + 13 x 5 + 70 x 5 + 66 x 3\n    which is 795 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 796. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 3, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 5, 4, 1, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 4, 4, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 4, 4, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 4, 3, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    38 x 0 + 25 x 3 + 44 x 4 + 52 x 3 + 63 x 1\n    which is 470 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 471. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

It is significantly lower than my outside option, so accepting is not a good idea.\n\nNext, consider walking away. If I walk away, I get 759.\n\nNow, let's consider a counteroffer. I need to figure out an offer that Player 2 might accept and that is better than my outside option. Since I have 5 - 4 = 1 unit of item 1, 3 - 2 = 1 unit of item 2, 4 - 1 = 3 unit of item 3, 7 - 2 = 5 units of item 4, and 3 - 0 = 3 units of item 5 remaining for myself.\n\nThe total value of all the items is 822. Currently, I am receiving an offer worth 199.\n\nLet's make an offer that gives Player 2 most of the items, but keeps a good portion of item 3 for myself, because it has the highest value.\nI will offer Player 2: [4, 2, 1, 6, 2]\n\nThis means I keep 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 1 unit of item 5 for myself.\nMy value: 1*6 + 1*16 + 3*97 + 1*23 + 1*65 = 6 + 16 + 291 + 23 + 65 = 401\nDiscounted value: 401 * 0.98 = 392.98\n\nThis is not better than my outside offer.\n\nLet's try another offer. I will offer player 2: [4, 2, 0, 2, 0].\nThis means I keep 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 for myself.\nMy value: 1*6 + 1*16 + 4*97 + 5*23 + 3*65 = 6 + 16 + 388 + 115 + 195 = 720\nDiscounted value: 720 * 0.98 = 705.6\n\nStill not better than outside offer.\n\nI need to get closer to my outside offer value, while considering that Player 2 has to accept this offer. Given that I am at round 2, it might be difficult to reach a good deal.\n\nI'll try to slightly improve my previous offer. I will offer [4, 2, 0, 1, 0].\nMy value is 1*6 + 1*16 + 4*97 + 6*23 + 3*65 = 6 + 16 + 388 + 138 + 195 = 743.\nDiscounted Value: 743 * 0.98 = 728.14. Still not good enough.\n\nGiven the discount factor and the remaining rounds, it is unlikely that I can make a deal that exceeds my outside option value.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

My values for these items are 17, 31, 18, 81, and 48. My outside offer is 320. The discount factor is 0.98.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the current offer:\n1 * 17 + 1 * 31 + 3 * 18 + 1 * 81 + 1 * 48 = 17 + 31 + 54 + 81 + 48 = 231\n\nNow, we need to consider the discount factor. Since it is round 2, the discount factor is 0.98^(2-1) = 0.98.  So, the present value of the current offer is 231 * 0.98 = 226.38.\n\nSince 226.38 < 320, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away and taking my outside offer. Therefore, I should consider making a counteroffer. I need to figure out an offer that Player 2 is likely to accept, but gives me more than 320 / 0.98 = 326.53 (the discounted value I need to beat).\n\nI have the following quantities of each item: 3, 4, 5, 3, 3.  If I offer player 2 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], I get the full value:\n3 * 17 + 4 * 31 + 5 * 18 + 3 * 81 + 3 * 48 = 51 + 124 + 90 + 243 + 144 = 652\nThe discounted value is 652 * 0.98 = 638.96.\n\nSince this is round 2, I can try to make a moderately generous offer to Player 2, hoping they accept. Let's try offering Player 2 [1, 1, 1, 1, 1].\nMy value:\n(3-1) * 17 + (4-1) * 31 + (5-1) * 18 + (3-1) * 81 + (3-1) * 48 = 2 * 17 + 3 * 31 + 4 * 18 + 2 * 81 + 2 * 48 = 34 + 93 + 72 + 162 + 96 = 457\nDiscounted value: 457 * 0.98 = 447.86.\n\nThis is better than my outside offer.\n\nLet's check another offer, say [0, 1, 2, 0, 0].\nMy value:\n3 * 17 + (4-1) * 31 + (5-2) * 18 + 3 * 81 + 3 * 48 = 51 + 93 + 54 + 243 + 144 = 585\nDiscounted value: 585 * 0.98 = 573.3\n\nLet's offer [1, 1, 2, 1, 1].\nMy value:\n(3-1) * 17 + (4-1) * 31 + (5-2) * 18 + (3-1) * 81 + (3-1) * 48 = 2 * 17 + 3 * 31 + 3 * 18 + 2 * 81 + 2 * 48 = 34 + 93 + 54 + 162 + 96 = 439\nDiscounted value: 439 * 0.98 = 430.22.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 2, 2, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    60 x 1 + 50 x 0 + 59 x 2 + 74 x 2 + 98 x 0\n    which is 326 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 327. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This suggests they may value items 2, 3, and 5 highly.\n\n   Let me calculate a potential counteroffer where I keep more of the high-value items for me (especially item 5 which is my highest value):\n   If I offer [3, 2, 2, 2, 1], I would keep [3, 1, 2, 2, 3]\n   My value: (3\u00d760) + (1\u00d750) + (2\u00d759) + (2\u00d774) + (3\u00d798) = 180 + 50 + 118 + 148 + 294 = 790\n\n   This counteroffer would be worth 790 to me, which is better than both the current offer (656) and my outside offer (327).\n\nBased on this analysis, I should make a counteroffer.

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 327. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 327. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1023 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 2, 2, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    60 x 1 + 50 x 0 + 59 x 2 + 74 x 2 + 98 x 0\n    which is 326 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 327. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [6, 0, 0, 4, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 2, 2, 2, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [3, 1, 1, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 1, 1, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

I need to consider what Player 2 might value the items at and make an offer that is attractive enough for them to accept but also leaves me with a value greater than my outside offer of 574.\n\nLet's start with an equal split as a baseline.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 1, 2, 5, 7] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    51 x 4 + 46 x 1 + 71 x 2 + 84 x 5 + 46 x 7\n    which is 1134 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1135. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

My values for these items are 79, 13, 20, 29, and 79. My outside offer is 35. The discount factor is 0.98.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of Player 2's offer to me:\n(1 * 79) + (2 * 13) + (1 * 20) + (1 * 29) + (2 * 79) = 79 + 26 + 20 + 29 + 158 = 312\n\nNow, we discount this value by the discount factor raised to the power of (round - 1), which is (2-1) = 1.\nDiscounted value = 312 * (0.98)^1 = 312 * 0.98 = 305.76\n\nSince 305.76 is greater than my outside offer of 35, accepting the offer is better than walking away *if* the game ends here.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. I currently have 5 units of item 1, 8 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 7 units of item 5. Player 2 is offering me 1, 2, 1, 1, and 2 units respectively.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 5, 4, 3, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    58 x 3 + 93 x 5 + 68 x 4 + 17 x 3 + 23 x 3\n    which is 1031 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1032. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Let's calculate my value:\n- Keep all 4 units of item 1: 4 \u00d7 58 = 232\n- Keep all 5 units of item 2: 5 \u00d7 93 = 465\n- Keep all 4 units of item 3: 4 \u00d7 68 = 272\n- Keep 0 units of item 4: 0 \u00d7 17 = 0\n- Keep all 3 units of item 5: 3 \u00d7 23 = 69\n\nTotal value: 232 + 465 + 272 + 0 + 69 = 1038\n\nThis is better than my outside offer value of 1032. I'll make this counteroffer.\n\n### Step 4: Make a decision\n\nBased on my analysis:\n- The current offer gives me a value of 478, which is much less than my outside offer value of 1032.\n- I've calculated a counteroffer that gives me 1038, which is better than my outside offer.\n- This counteroffer retains items 1, 2, 3, and 5 (which have higher value to me) and gives away item 4 (which has less value to me).\n\nTherefore, I will make a counteroffer of [0, 0, 0, 3, 0], which means I give Player 1 0 units of items 1, 2, and 3, all 3 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 3, 0]}",

I want to maximize my gains, but also make an offer that Player 2 might accept. To figure out a good counteroffer, let's analyze Player 2's initial offer [0, 0, 0, 3, 0]. They clearly value item 4 highly, so I should try to keep some of the items with high unit values to me. Let's propose an offer where I get to keep items 1, 2, and 3, give player all item 5, and give them 1 item 4.\n\nMy counteroffer to Player 2: [4, 5, 4, 1, 3]\n\nThis means I keep:\n- 0 units of item 1\n- 0 units of item 2\n- 0 units of item 3\n- 2 units of item 4\n- 0 units of item 5\n\nValue of this to me: 2 * 91 = 182\nDiscounted value: 182 * 0.98 = 178.36. This is less than my outside offer, so this would not be a good offer. \n\nLet's try again. I will keep all of items 1 and 3 and 1 of item 4, and give the remainder to Player 2. This leads to the counteroffer:\nCounteroffer: [0, 5, 0, 2, 3]\n\nThis means I keep:\n- 4 units of item 1\n- 0 units of item 2\n- 4 units of item 3\n- 1 units of item 4\n- 0 units of item 5\n\nValue of this to me: (4 * 56) + (4 * 61) + (1 * 91) = 224 + 244 + 91 = 559\nDiscounted value: 559 * 0.98 = 547.82\n\nThis is much better than my outside offer!

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 5, 4, 3, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    58 x 3 + 93 x 5 + 68 x 4 + 17 x 3 + 23 x 3\n    which is 1031 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1032. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 2, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 3, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 5, 0, 2, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 5, 0, 2, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

Let's offer them:\n\nItem 1: 3 (all of it)\nItem 2: 1\nItem 3: 3\nItem 4: 2\nItem 5: 2\n\nThis leaves me with:\nItem 1: 0\nItem 2: 3\nItem 3: 3\nItem 4: 6\nItem 5: 2\n\nMy value: (0 * 7) + (3 * 76) + (3 * 23) + (6 * 94) + (2 * 48) = 0 + 228 + 69 + 564 + 96 = 957\n\nThis is significantly less than my outside offer. Let's try a different offer, biasing my position significantly to see if Player 2 accepts. I will offer them:\n\nItem 1: 3\nItem 2: 3\nItem 3: 4\nItem 4: 4\nItem 5: 3\n\nThis leaves me with:\nItem 1: 0\nItem 2: 1\nItem 3: 2\nItem 4: 4\nItem 5: 1\n\nMy value = (0 * 7) + (1 * 76) + (2 * 23) + (4 * 94) + (1 * 48) = 0 + 76 + 46 + 376 + 48 = 546\n\nThis is still very low. I think I need to play a bit more aggressively to maximize my return and hope they accept it or walk. It's better than walking. I will offer:\n\nItem 1: 1\nItem 2: 2\nItem 3: 3\nItem 4: 4\nItem 5: 2\n\nThis leaves me with:\nItem 1: 2 * 7 = 14\nItem 2: 2 * 76 = 152\nItem 3: 3 * 23 = 69\nItem 4: 4 * 94 = 376\nItem 5: 2 * 48 = 96\n\nMy Value: 14 + 152 + 69 + 376 + 96 = 707\n\nOkay, it seems my best option would be to offer them as close to half as possible to start, or aggressively try to offer them only my low value items. I'm going to try the aggressive approach.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 3, 4, 4, 3]}\n",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 5, 4, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    1 x 0 + 71 x 2 + 79 x 5 + 9 x 4 + 70 x 4\n    which is 853 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 854. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 3, 4, 4, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 3, 4, 4, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 5, 4, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    1 x 0 + 71 x 2 + 79 x 5 + 9 x 4 + 70 x 4\n    which is 853 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 854. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 3, 4, 4, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 1, 0, 6, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Let's evaluate this offer.\n\nMy values are: item 1: 7, item 2: 76, item 3: 23, item 4: 94, item 5: 48.\nSo, the value of the current offer to me is:\n(1 * 7) + (0 * 76) + (0 * 23) + (7 * 94) + (0 * 48) = 7 + 0 + 0 + 658 + 0 = 665.\nSince it is round 3, this value is multiplied by the discount factor 0.98^(3-1) = 0.98^2 = 0.9604.\nThe discounted value of the current offer to me is 665 * 0.9604 = 638.666.\nMy outside offer is 1116. Thus, accepting the current offer is significantly worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider a counteroffer. Since this is the last round, Player 2 will either accept my offer or walk away. To maximize my chance of getting a deal better than my outside offer, I should offer Player 2 just enough to be better than their outside offer, but not more. Since I do not know Player 2's values or outside offer, it's hard to determine a good counteroffer without more information.\n\nGiven that accepting gives me 638.666 and walking gives me 1116, I will attempt to offer a counteroffer that is more beneficial than the current offer to myself. \n\nLet's try to make a reasonable counteroffer where I keep a good portion of item 4, since that is the item where I get the most value. I'll propose giving Player 2: [3, 4, 6, 1, 4]. This means I keep: [0, 0, 0, 7, 0].\nMy value will be (0 * 7) + (0 * 76) + (0 * 23) + (7 * 94) + (0 * 48) = 658.\nThe discounted value of this offer to me is 658 * 0.9604 = 632.\n\nLet me propose a different counteroffer.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 937. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 729 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 6, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    31 x 0 + 5 x 0 + 51 x 0 + 84 x 6 + 72 x 6\n    which is 936 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 937. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 6, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 6, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

What can I infer from Player 1's offer?\n- They want all of items 1, 2, 3, and 5\n- They're willing to give me 6 of 9 units of item 4\n- This suggests they might value item 4 less than the other items\n\nLet me design a counteroffer that gives me at least 937 in value:\n- I highly value items 4 and 5, so I should keep most of these\n- Item 3 is also quite valuable to me\n- Items 1 and 2 are less valuable, especially item 2\n\nLet me try keeping:\n- 1 unit of item 1: 1 \u00d7 31 = 31\n- 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 5 = 5\n- 5 units of item 3: 5 \u00d7 51 = 255\n- 7 units of item 4: 7 \u00d7 84 = 588\n- 4 units of item 5: 4 \u00d7 72 = 288\n- Total: 31 + 5 + 255 + 588 + 288 = 1,167\n\nThis gives me a value of 1,167, which is greater than my outside offer of 937.\n\nMy counteroffer would be [2, 3, 2, 2, 2], which means:\n- I give Player 1: 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5\n- I keep: 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 7 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5\n\n### Step 3: Make a decision\n- I should not accept the current offer (504 < 937)\n- I should not walk away since I can make a counteroffer better than my outside offer\n- I should make the counteroffer [2, 3, 2, 2, 2] which gives me a value of 1,167\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 3, 2, 2, 2]}",

I have 5 units of item 1, 7 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5. My values are 95, 81, 26, 26, and 56 respectively. My outside offer is 943.\n\nSince this is round 1, I want to make an offer that is likely to be accepted, or at least will lead to a better outcome for me than my outside option. It's a balancing act - I want to keep as much value as possible for myself, but also make the offer attractive enough for Player 2 to accept.\n\nA simple strategy is to divide everything in half, which would be difficult to do with the given quantities. Another strategy would be to give Player 2 enough to exceed their expected payoff from their outside offer, but that would require knowledge of Player 2's values and their outside offer, which is unknown. Another approach is to propose a split close to even (in terms of value), and see if it gets accepted, and adjust from there.\n\nLet's start by giving Player 2 slightly more than half the items, based on my own valuation. Let's aim for a split of 60/40 where I keep 40% of the total value. My total value of all items is 1310. Keeping 40% means I need to achieve at least 524. That would leave player 2 with 786 based on my valuations. I also need this value to exceed my outside option 943.\n\nLet's try giving Player 2 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5. This gives them:\n* 3 * 95 = 285\n* 4 * 81 = 324\n* 2 * 26 = 52\n* 1 * 26 = 26\n* 1 * 56 = 56\nTotal = 743\n\nThis is close to half, but not quite as high as I want. So, let's give Player 2 a bit more. Let's give Player 2 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4 and 2 units of item 5. This would give player 2 a total value of\n3 * 95 = 285\n4 * 81 = 324\n2 * 26 = 52\n1 * 26 = 26\n2 * 56 = 112\nTotal = 799\n\nThis would give me a total value of 1310 - 799 = 511, which is less than my outside offer.\n\nLet's modify the offer, and give Player 2 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 unit of item 3, 0 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\nThis gives player 2 a value of:\n3 * 95 = 285\n4 * 81 = 324\n2 * 26 = 52\n0 * 26 = 0\n1 * 56 = 56\nTotal = 717\n\nThen my value would be 1310 - 717 = 593 which is better than my outside offer, with some chance of them also accepting.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 4, 2, 0, 1]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 1, 3, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party.

It is round 2, and Player 2 is offering me [1, 2, 1, 1, 0] units of items 1 through 5, respectively.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the value of this offer to me:\n- 1 unit of item 1: 1 * 95 = 95\n- 2 units of item 2: 2 * 81 = 162\n- 1 unit of item 3: 1 * 26 = 26\n- 1 unit of item 4: 1 * 26 = 26\n- 0 units of item 5: 0 * 56 = 0\nTotal value of the offer: 95 + 162 + 26 + 26 + 0 = 309\n\nNow, I need to discount this value by the discount factor for round 2 (gamma^(r-1) = 0.98^(2-1) = 0.98):\nDiscounted value: 309 * 0.98 = 302.82\n\nThis discounted value (302.82) is much lower than my outside offer value of 943. Therefore, accepting this offer would be a bad choice.\n\nNext, consider what happened in Round 1. I offered Player 2 [3, 4, 2, 0, 1]. They countered with [1, 2, 1, 1, 0]. This implies they value items 4 and 5 more than I do. It also looks like they value item 1 more than I do.\n\nI need to calculate what I would get if I walked away. That would be my outside offer of 943.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. I want to maximize my value, taking into account the discount factor and the likely response of Player 2. Since it is round 2, I'm unlikely to get Player 2 to give me too much more.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I keep a majority of each item, but give player 2 a little more of items 4 and 5, and take a bit more of item 1. Something like offering them [0, 2, 1, 0, 0]. That gives me [5, 5, 3, 2, 2].\n\nLet's compute the value of this for me:\n- 5 * 95 = 475\n- 5 * 81 = 405\n- 3 * 26 = 78\n- 2 * 26 = 52\n- 2 * 56 = 112\nTotal Value = 1122\nDiscounted Value = 1122 * 0.98 = 1099.56.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 1, 3, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    45 x 4 + 17 x 1 + 34 x 3 + 27 x 2 + 53 x 2\n    which is 459 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 460. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values.

They've reduced what they're asking for items 1, 4, and 5, which suggests these might be lower value to them than items 2 and 3.\n\nIf I were to make a counteroffer, I would need to ensure it's worth more than my outside offer of 460.

My goal is to maximize my discounted value, considering my outside option of 115 and the possibility of future rounds.\n\nSince I have no information about Player 2's values, I'll start with a relatively fair offer that slightly favors me, hoping to avoid immediate rejection. I'll aim to get a value close to my outside option but leave enough on the table for Player 2 to also find the deal attractive.  I'll divide the items such that I get slightly more of the high-value items and less of the low-value items.\n\nHere's the item split I'm proposing (what Player 2 receives):\n\n*   Item 1: 2 units\n*   Item 2: 0 units\n*   Item 3: 1 unit\n*   Item 4: 1 unit\n*   Item 5: 3 units\n\nNow, let's calculate what this offer means for me:\n*   Item 1: 4 - 2 = 2 units * 8 = 16\n*   Item 2: 1 - 0 = 1 units * 45 = 45\n*   Item 3: 3 - 1 = 2 units * 76 = 152\n*   Item 4: 3 - 1 = 2 units * 95 = 190\n*   Item 5: 6 - 3 = 3 units * 39 = 117\n\nTotal Value for me = 16 + 45 + 152 + 190 + 117 = 520\n\nSince 520 is significantly higher than my outside offer of 115, and I have no idea what is valuable for Player 2, I'll proceed with this offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 1, 1, 3]}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 1, 2, 3, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    66 x 4 + 84 x 1 + 12 x 2 + 94 x 3 + 62 x 6\n    which is 1026 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1027. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 1, 1, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 0, 1, 1, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 868. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 852 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 4, 1, 5, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    99 x 5 + 53 x 4 + 15 x 1 + 29 x 5 + 88 x 0\n    which is 867 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 868. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the value of the current offer on the table to me. The offer is [1, 2, 3, 2, 0], meaning I receive 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n\nValue calculation:\n* Item 1: 1 * 1 = 1\n* Item 2: 2 * 31 = 62\n* Item 3: 3 * 54 = 162\n* Item 4: 2 * 81 = 162\n* Item 5: 0 * 39 = 0\nTotal value = 1 + 62 + 162 + 162 + 0 = 387\n\nNow I need to consider the discount factor. This is round 2, so the discount factor is 0.98^(2-1) = 0.98.  Therefore, the present value of accepting this offer is 387 * 0.98 = 379.26\n\nMy outside offer is worth 606. Since 379.26 is less than 606, accepting is worse than walking away right now. I need to make a counteroffer.\n\nIn the last round, any counteroffer by Player 2 will be treated as a walk. Since I need to make a counteroffer now, I'll need to consider how to make this attractive for player 2, and in turn, maximise the expected value. Let's assume that Player 2 will accept an offer that gives them at least as much value as what they received in the previous round's offer, discounted. The previous offer from player 1 gave them [2, 1, 1, 1, 0], which means I would receive [5, 5, 3, 4, 0].\nI need to figure out what Player 2's valuation of [1, 2, 3, 2, 0] is.

Then this deal is worth 1 * v1 + 2 * v2 + 3 * v3 + 2 * v4 + 0 * v5.\nThe offer I made last round [2, 1, 1, 1, 0] had a value to me of: 2*1 + 1*31 + 1*54 + 1*81 = 2 + 31 + 54 + 81 = 168. This means I received [5, 5, 3, 4, 0], so my value was 5*1 + 5*31 + 3*54 + 4*81 = 5 + 155 + 162 + 324 = 646.\nI want to do better than my outside offer. Since I am already in the second round, I only have one chance to get a deal done.\nI'll make a counteroffer that gives the player a little more than what they would have from the previous offer, discounted. I will offer them [1, 2, 2, 1, 0]\n\nMy value for this is:\n(7-1)*1 + (6-2)*31 + (4-2)*54 + (5-1)*81 + (0-0)*39 = 6*1 + 4*31 + 2*54 + 4*81 = 6 + 124 + 108 + 324 = 562\nDiscounted, this would be 562 * 0.98 = 550.76, which is still below my outside offer value.\n\nSince it's the second round and I need to beat my outside offer, I will try to get a deal that's closer to being equal.\nLet's offer [0, 1, 2, 1, 0]\nMy value: (7-0)*1 + (6-1)*31 + (4-2)*54 + (5-1)*81 + (0-0)*39 = 7 + 5*31 + 2*54 + 4*81 = 7 + 155 + 108 + 324 = 594\nDiscounted: 594 * 0.98 = 582.12 still below the 606\n\nLet's try [0, 0, 1, 1, 0].\nMy value: 7*1 + 6*31 + 3*54 + 4*81 + 0*39 = 7 + 186 + 162 + 324 = 679.\nDiscounted: 679 * 0.98 = 665.42\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]}\n",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 2, 6, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    18 x 2 + 68 x 0 + 73 x 2 + 74 x 6 + 70 x 0\n    which is 626 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 627. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

The discounted value of the current offer (363.58) is less than my outside offer. Therefore, accepting the current offer would be a bad deal.\n\n**Possible Counteroffers:**\n\nI need to consider what counteroffer would be better than walking away. Since Player 2 made a counteroffer in the first round, they are likely interested in a deal. My goal is to find a counteroffer that Player 2 might accept, while still giving me more than my outside offer.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I offer Player 2 slightly less than their first offer, while ensuring I get a large portion of the items that I value highly.\n\nPlayer 2's offer in round 1 was [2, 1, 1, 3, 0] (to me). This means they requested:\n\n*   1 unit of item 1\n*   2 units of item 2\n*   3 units of item 3\n*   4 units of item 4\n*   2 units of item 5\n\nLet's try offering Player 2 the following: [1, 2, 2, 4, 1]. This implies I will keep:\n* 2 units of item 1\n* 1 unit of item 2\n* 2 units of item 3\n* 3 units of item 4\n* 1 unit of item 5\n\nMy value: 2 * 78 + 1 * 85 + 2 * 82 + 3 * 16 + 1 * 41 = 156 + 85 + 164 + 48 + 41 = 494\n\nDiscounted Value: 494 * 0.98 = 484.12\n\nStill less than 665. Let's try to be more aggressive. My goal is to get closer to 665.\n\nIf I offered Player 2 [0, 0, 0, 7, 0], then I would get:\n* 3 units of item 1\n* 3 units of item 2\n* 4 units of item 3\n* 0 units of item 4\n* 2 units of item 5\n\nMy value: 3 * 78 + 3 * 85 + 4 * 82 + 0 * 16 + 2 * 41 = 234 + 255 + 328 + 0 + 82 = 899\n\nDiscounted value: 899 * 0.98 = 881.02. This is greater than my outside offer, but this is unlikely to be accepted by Player 2.\n\nLet's try offering Player 2 [1, 1, 1, 5, 1]. This implies I will keep:\n* 2 units of item 1\n* 2 unit of item 2\n* 3 units of item 3\n* 2 units of item 4\n* 1 unit of item 5\n\nMy value: 2 * 78 + 2 * 85 + 3 * 82 + 2 * 16 + 1 * 41 = 156 + 170 + 246 + 32 + 41 = 645\n\nDiscounted Value: 645 * 0.98 = 632.10. Still less than 665.\n\nIt seems the only way I can get over 665 is to take almost everything. Since that probably won't work, and I don't have much time, I'll walk.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 4, 3, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    99 x 0 + 77 x 1 + 12 x 4 + 29 x 3 + 95 x 3\n    which is 497 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 498. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 2, 2, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 2, 2, 2, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 498. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 936 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 4, 3, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    99 x 0 + 77 x 1 + 12 x 4 + 29 x 3 + 95 x 3\n    which is 497 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 498. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 2, 2, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 2, 3, 3, 3]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 3, 3, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 3, 3, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 5, 2, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    4 x 0 + 24 x 3 + 61 x 5 + 41 x 2 + 94 x 3\n    which is 741 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 744. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 3, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 3, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 5, 2, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    4 x 0 + 24 x 3 + 61 x 5 + 41 x 2 + 94 x 3\n    which is 741 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 744. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 3, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 1, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 1, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 744. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 744. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 672 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 5, 2, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    4 x 0 + 24 x 3 + 61 x 5 + 41 x 2 + 94 x 3\n    which is 741 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 744. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 3, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [0, 2, 0, 1, 0]\nRound 3: Player 1 offered [0, 5, 6, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 5, 6, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 4, 3, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    59 x 0 + 39 x 0 + 2 x 4 + 35 x 3 + 63 x 5\n    which is 428 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 429. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

That means I get:\n\n*   Item 1: 2 units\n*   Item 2: 3 units\n*   Item 3: 11 units\n*   Item 4: 5 units\n*   Item 5: 5 units\n\nMy value would be: (2 * 98) + (3 * 30) + (11 * 2) + (5 * 56) + (5 * 17) = 196 + 90 + 22 + 280 + 85 = 673.\nThe discounted value would be 673 * 0.9604 = 646.35\n\nPlayer 2's current offer to me is [0, 1, 11, 2, 0]. This means Player 2 keeps [2, 2, 0, 3, 5]. We don't know Player 2's valuations of each item, and there is no way of knowing if Player 2 would accept the offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\nThe current offer gives me a discounted value of 157.5056. My outside offer is 499, so walking gives me more value.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 6, 0, 3, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    11 x 1 + 71 x 6 + 66 x 0 + 94 x 3 + 3 x 2\n    which is 725 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 726. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 3, 1, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 3, 1, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

My private values are 95, 75, 59, 33, and 31 for items 1 through 5. My outside offer is 602. The discount factor is 0.98.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the current offer to me:\n* 3 units of item 1: 3 * 95 = 285\n* 2 units of item 2: 2 * 75 = 150\n* 1 unit of item 3: 1 * 59 = 59\n* 1 unit of item 4: 1 * 33 = 33\n* 2 units of item 5: 2 * 31 = 62\nTotal value of current offer: 285 + 150 + 59 + 33 + 62 = 589\n\nNow, we need to discount this value to account for being in round 2:\nDiscounted value = 589 * (0.98)^(2-1) = 589 * 0.98 = 577.22\n\nSince the discounted value of the current offer (577.22) is less than my outside offer (602), accepting the offer is not in my best interest.\n\nLet's consider making a counteroffer. To make it worthwhile, it should offer me a value higher than 602/0.98 = 614.29. Since the other agent offered [3, 2, 1, 1, 2], they kept [1, 4, 2, 4, 0]. If I were to accept their round 1 offer of [2, 3, 1, 2, 1], the value would be:\n\n* 2 units of item 1: 2 * 95 = 190\n* 3 units of item 2: 3 * 75 = 225\n* 1 unit of item 3: 1 * 59 = 59\n* 2 units of item 4: 2 * 33 = 66\n* 1 unit of item 5: 1 * 31 = 31\nTotal value = 190 + 225 + 59 + 66 + 31 = 571\n\nThe discounted value would be 571 * 0.98 = 559.58, which is also less than 602.\n\nLet's see if offering them my reservation value is possible. I want to find an offer to player 2 such that I get 614.29 now. The total value of all items is 4*95 + 6*75 + 3*59 + 5*33 + 2*31 = 380 + 450 + 177 + 165 + 62 = 1234. I need to make the total value of my items to be 614.29. Then Player 2 gets the remaining 1234 - 614.29 = 619.71. This seems difficult without knowledge of Player 2's values.\n\nLet's propose a counteroffer which would yield me at least 602.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 726. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 735 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 6, 0, 3, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    11 x 1 + 71 x 6 + 66 x 0 + 94 x 3 + 3 x 2\n    which is 725 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 726. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 3, 1, 2, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 2, 1, 1, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 4, 2, 3, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 4, 2, 3, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 4, 2, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    72 x 0 + 75 x 4 + 31 x 2 + 82 x 0 + 4 x 2\n    which is 370 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 371. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "I need to analyze this offer and decide whether to accept, walk away, or make a counteroffer.\n\n## 1) Analyzing the current situation\n\n- My outside offer value: 371\n- My values per item: 72 for item 1, 75 for item 2, 31 for item 3, 82 for item 4, 4 for item 5\n- Total items to divide: 2 units of item 1, 7 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5\n- Current discount factor: 0.98^(2-1) = 0.98 (since we're in round 2)\n- If negotiations continue to round 3, the discount factor will be 0.98^2 = 0.9604\n\n## 2) Assessing the value of the current offer\n\nPlayer 1 is offering me: [1, 2, 2, 0, 3]\nThis means I would keep: [1, 5, 3, 1, 2]\n\nValue to me:\n- 1 unit of item 1: 1 \u00d7 72 = 72\n- 5 units of item 2: 5 \u00d7 75 = 375\n- 3 units of item 3: 3 \u00d7 31 = 93\n- 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 82 = 82\n- 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 4 = 8\n\nTotal value: 72 + 375 + 93 + 82 + 8 = 630\nWith discount factor: 630 \u00d7 0.98 = 617.4\n\nThis is significantly higher than my outside offer of 371.\n\n## 3) Considering potential counteroffers\n\nFrom Player 1's offers, I can infer some preferences:\n- They seem okay with giving me 1 unit of item 1\n- They reduced their offer of item 3 from keeping 3 to keeping 2\n- They're keeping all of item 4, suggesting they value it highly\n- They increased their offer of item 5 to me, suggesting they don't value it much\n\nLet me try a counteroffer that might work even better for me:\n[1, 2, 2, 0, 4]\n\nThis would mean I keep: [1, 5, 3, 1, 1]\nValue calculation:\n- 1 unit of item 1: 1 \u00d7 72 = 72\n- 5 units of item 2: 5 \u00d7 75 = 375\n- 3 units of item 3: 3 \u00d7 31 = 93\n- 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 82 = 82\n- 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 4 = 4\n\nTotal value: 72 + 375 + 93 + 82 + 4 = 626\nWith potential next round discount: 626 \u00d7 0.9604 = 601.2\n\nSince this counteroffer would be only marginally worse for me than the current offer (if accepted in the next round), and the current offer is already very good (617.4 vs my outside offer of 371), I should accept the current offer.\n\n## Decision\n\nThe current offer gives me a value of 617.4, which is significantly higher than my outside offer of 371. Making a counteroffer would risk getting a worse deal after the discount factor, and there's always the risk of the other player walking away.\n\nTherefore, I will accept the current offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",
