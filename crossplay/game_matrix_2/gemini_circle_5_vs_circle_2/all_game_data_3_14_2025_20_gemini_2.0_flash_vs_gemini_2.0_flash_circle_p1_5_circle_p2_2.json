Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 204. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 204. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 996 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 0, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    44 x 1 + 93 x 1 + 86 x 0 + 66 x 1 + 43 x 0\n    which is 203 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 204. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Since it is round 1, the discount factor has not yet affected the value of accepting a deal or walking away.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   There is no current offer on the table.\n*   Let's consider some potential counteroffers: I want to make an offer that is greater than my outside offer.\n\nLet's consider offering player 2 one unit of item 1, no units of item 2, one unit of item 3, one unit of item 4, and zero unit of item 5.\nMy value would then be:\nItem 1: (2-1) * 44 = 44\nItem 2: (1-0) * 93 = 93\nItem 3: (3-1) * 86 = 172\nItem 4: (2-1) * 66 = 66\nItem 5: (1-0) * 43 = 43\nTotal value: 44 + 93 + 172 + 66 + 43 = 418\n\nThis is greater than my outside offer, so it may be a good initial starting point.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince it's the first round, I should make a counteroffer to start the negotiation.

This means I would receive:\n* 1 unit of item 1\n* 0 units of item 2\n* 1 unit of item 3\n* 1 unit of item 4\n* 0 units of item 5\n\nMy private values are: 93, 47, 22, 47, 98.\n\nTherefore, the value of the current offer to me is:\n(1 * 93) + (0 * 47) + (1 * 22) + (1 * 47) + (0 * 98) = 93 + 0 + 22 + 47 + 0 = 162\n\nMy outside offer is 308. Since 162 < 308, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider a counteroffer. I need to offer something to Player 1, keeping the rest for myself, and the value to me must be greater than 308 after considering the discount factor in subsequent rounds. Since it is round 1, if I make a counteroffer now and player 1 accepts it, it will be multiplied by 0.98^(1-1) = 1. This factor will be 0.98 in round 2 and 0.98*0.98 in round 3.\nI need to determine the maximum possible value I could get and create an offer that is better than my walk away option. \nThe total number of items are 2+1+3+2+1 = 9, so my maximum possible value is (2 * 93) + (1 * 47) + (3 * 22) + (2 * 47) + (1 * 98) = 186 + 47 + 66 + 94 + 98 = 491\nIf I could get this entire value it would be better than walking away. \nGiven that this is the first round, and I have a fairly strong outside offer, I will aim for a good deal. I should provide a counteroffer where I retain the majority of the high-value items and give player 1 the low-value items to secure a better offer for myself.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I give Player 1: [1, 1, 2, 1, 1]\nThis leaves me with [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]. This is the original offer, which I already calculated at 162. It is not better than my outside offer, so this counteroffer doesn't work.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I give Player 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nThis leaves me with [2, 1, 3, 2, 1]. The value to me is (2 * 93) + (1 * 47) + (3 * 22) + (2 * 47) + (1 * 98) = 186 + 47 + 66 + 94 + 98 = 491\nIf I offered player 1 nothing, my value would be 491, which is greater than my outside option. This might be too greedy and result in the other player walking away though.\n\nLet's split item 3 and 4 evenly.\nI will offer player 1: [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]\nThis leaves me with [2, 1, 2, 1, 1]. The value to me is (2 * 93) + (1 * 47) + (2 * 22) + (1 * 47) + (1 * 98) = 186 + 47 + 44 + 47 + 98 = 422\nThis value is more than my outside offer.\n\nI think making a reasonable counteroffer now is the best course of action, as I stand to gain more than my outside offer.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. It's round 2, and Player 1 is offering me [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]. This means they want to give me 1 unit of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n\nMy values for each item are:\n- Item 1: 93\n- Item 2: 47\n- Item 3: 22\n- Item 4: 47\n- Item 5: 98\n\nSo, the value of this offer to me is:\n(1 * 93) + (0 * 47) + (1 * 22) + (1 * 47) + (1 * 98) = 93 + 0 + 22 + 47 + 98 = 260\n\nNow, we need to consider the discount factor. Since it's round 2, the discount factor is 0.98^(2-1) = 0.98.\nSo, the present value of this offer is 260 * 0.98 = 254.8\n\nMy outside offer is 308.\n\nSince the present value of the current offer (254.8) is less than my outside offer (308), accepting it would be worse than walking away.\n\nNow let's think about a counteroffer. I have the following items:\n- Item 1: 2 units\n- Item 2: 1 unit\n- Item 3: 3 units\n- Item 4: 2 units\n- Item 5: 1 unit\n\nTotal value of all items to me: (2*93) + (1*47) + (3*22) + (2*47) + (1*98) = 186 + 47 + 66 + 94 + 98 = 491.\n\nSince it's round 2, making a counteroffer would be risky. If Player 1 rejects it, we go to round 3, which would be the last round, and my attempt to make a final offer is treated as a WALK. So, I need to make sure any counteroffer is compelling enough for Player 1 to accept immediately.\n\nI could try to offer Player 1 a deal that leaves me with slightly more than my outside offer, considering the discount factor. However, without knowing Player 1's values, this is difficult. A simple counteroffer could be giving away the items I value the least to get them to accept: offer all of item 3 and 4 to them. \n\nLet's offer Player 1 [2, 1, 3, 2, 0]. This leaves me with [0, 0, 0, 0, 1], which is worth 98 to me.  98 * 0.98 = 96.04, which is far below my outside option. This is terrible.\n\nLet's try to extract as much value as possible. It is possible that Player 1 values item 1 and 5 highly. Suppose I keep the items with the highest value for myself and give the others to player 1. In this case, I keep items 1 and 5, with the rest going to player 1.\nSo my offer is [0, 1, 3, 2, 0].\nThis means I receive 2 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4 and 1 unit of item 5. This is worth (2*93) + (1*98) = 186+98=284.\nAfter discount it is 284 * 0.98 = 278.32. This is still less than my walkaway.\n\nThe current offer is bad and making another offer is very likely to result in the same payoff as walking away, I will choose to walk away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    10 x 1 + 23 x 0 + 46 x 0 + 54 x 0 + 93 x 0\n    which is 10 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 14. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

This means that offers in later rounds are worth slightly less.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - Current offer: There is no current offer.\n   - Potential counteroffers: I need to propose an offer. Since it's the first round, I want to start with an offer that is somewhat favorable to me but still potentially acceptable to Player 2. I need to keep in mind my outside offer of 14.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   - I need to propose a counteroffer. I'll start by trying to keep a significant portion of the most valuable item (item 5) while offering more of the less valuable items to Player 2.\n\nLet's start with offering Player 2: 3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n\nMy share would then be:\n- Item 1: 6 - 3 = 3 units\n- Item 2: 4 - 2 = 2 units\n- Item 3: 2 - 1 = 1 unit\n- Item 4: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n- Item 5: 5 - 2 = 3 units\n\nMy value for this division:\n- Item 1: 3 * 10 = 30\n- Item 2: 2 * 23 = 46\n- Item 3: 1 * 46 = 46\n- Item 4: 2 * 54 = 108\n- Item 5: 3 * 93 = 279\n- Total Value: 30 + 46 + 46 + 108 + 279 = 509\n\nSince 509 is much greater than my outside offer of 14, this division is acceptable to me.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 94. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 942 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 3, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    96 x 0 + 48 x 0 + 75 x 0 + 28 x 3 + 67 x 0\n    which is 84 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 94. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the optimal action for Round 1.\n\n1. **Analysis of the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 94\n*   My item values: Item 1: 96, Item 2: 48, Item 3: 75, Item 4: 28, Item 5: 67\n*   Total items: Item 1: 4, Item 2: 2, Item 3: 4, Item 4: 5, Item 5: 2\n*   Discount factor: 0.98.  Since this is round 1, the discount factor is 0.98^(1-1) = 1. So, delaying to future rounds won't change the value *yet*, but will in later rounds.\n\n2. **Assess potential counteroffers:**\n\nSince I am Player 1 and there is no current offer, I need to make an initial offer.  I want to make an offer that is better than my outside option if accepted. It also must be good enough for Player 2 to accept. A good approach is to start with an equal split to make sure it is better than my outside offer, then gradually adjust if needed.\n\nLet's start with an even split, and see if it's better than my outside offer value.\n*   Item 1: Give 2, Keep 2: 2 * 96 = 192\n*   Item 2: Give 1, Keep 1: 1 * 48 = 48\n*   Item 3: Give 2, Keep 2: 2 * 75 = 150\n*   Item 4: Give 2, Keep 3: 3 * 28 = 84\n*   Item 5: Give 1, Keep 1: 1 * 67 = 67\n    My value: 192 + 48 + 150 + 84 + 67 = 541. This is much better than my outside offer.\n    So, I'll offer [2, 1, 2, 2, 1] to Player 2.\n\n3. **Decision:**\n\nSince this split is favorable compared to my outside offer, and likely good for Player 2. I will propose a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 2, 2, 1]}\n```",

This means that an offer in round 3 is worth 0.98 times an offer in round 2, and an offer in round 2 is worth 0.98 times an offer in round 1.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   Current offer: Player 2 offers me [1, 0, 1, 2, 0].

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 19. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player1, 2 units of each item (keeping 2 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 774 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 2, 2, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 1, 2, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 2, 3, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 2, 3, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. It's round 2, and Player 1 is offering me [2, 1, 2, 3, 1]. My outside offer is 19. I need to decide whether to accept this offer, walk away, or make a counteroffer.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the current offer to me:\n\n*   Item 1: 2 units. I get 4 - 2 = 2 units. Value = 2 * 67 = 134\n*   Item 2: 1 unit. I get 2 - 1 = 1 unit. Value = 1 * 79 = 79\n*   Item 3: 2 units. I get 4 - 2 = 2 units. Value = 2 * 45 = 90\n*   Item 4: 3 units. I get 5 - 3 = 2 units. Value = 2 * 52 = 104\n*   Item 5: 1 unit. I get 2 - 1 = 1 unit. Value = 1 * 15 = 15\n\nTotal value of the offer = 134 + 79 + 90 + 104 + 15 = 422\n\nSince this is round 2, we need to multiply this value by the discount factor gamma^(r-1) = 0.98^(2-1) = 0.98.\n\nDiscounted value = 422 * 0.98 = 413.56\n\nThis is significantly higher than my outside offer of 19. Therefore, accepting is better than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. It's round 2, so if I make a counteroffer and it's not accepted, I effectively walk away in round 3. I need to determine if there is a counteroffer that is better than accepting. Since player 1 has already increased what they are offering me, it is likely they are close to their best offer and I could risk them choosing to walk away if I make another offer.\n\nTherefore, I should accept the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 7, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    48 x 0 + 90 x 3 + 81 x 7 + 95 x 0 + 8 x 0\n    which is 837 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 838. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

This means that waiting for a future round reduces the value of an outcome by a factor of 0.98.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - There is no current offer.\n   - I need to propose an offer (a division of items).  I want to maximize my value, keeping in mind the outside offer of 28.\n\n3) **Potential Counteroffers and Decision:**\n\nSince there is no current offer, I need to make an initial offer. I'll start by proposing a relatively even split and see how Player 2 responds. I will calculate the value of various offer to make sure it is greater than my outside option.\nI will start with a proposed offer and then fine-tune based on my calculations. Let's consider the simplest offer where I give Player 2 half of the items and retain the other half. Since it involves fractions and we can only give whole numbers, I will approximate an even division in my proposed offer.\nSpecifically I am going to propose the following to the other player: 3 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 2 of item 4 and 1 of item 5. \n\nThis means that I keep: 4 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 2 of item 4 and 2 of item 5. Let us calculate the value of what I retain:\n\n4 * 41 + 3 * 55 + 2 * 51 + 2 * 20 + 2 * 64 = 164 + 165 + 102 + 40 + 128 = 599\n\nSince 599 is greater than my outside offer, this is a valid offer. I am going to make this offer to the other player.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 2, 1, 2, 1]}\n```",

Since 273 > 37, accepting the current offer is better than walking away immediately.\n\nHowever, this is only round 1. There are two more rounds of negotiation possible. We need to consider if making a counteroffer could potentially yield an even better outcome, taking into account the discount factor of 0.98.\n\nLet's think about what a good counteroffer might look like. I want to maximize my value. Since Player 1 made the first offer, I can assume they are trying to maximize their value as well.\n\nMy total value for all items is 685. This suggests that Player 1's total value is probably of a similar scale. It is difficult to deduce what Player 1 values each item.\n\nGiven the discount factor, it is better to agree sooner rather than later.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items.

Value = 2 * 41 = 82\nItem 2: Offer 3, Keep 3. Value = 3 * 13 = 39\nItem 3: Offer 0.5, Keep 0.5. Value = 0.5 * 23 = 11.5\nItem 4: Offer 2.5, Keep 2.5. Value = 2.5 * 80 = 200\nItem 5: Offer 2.5, Keep 2.5. Value = 2.5 * 42 = 105\n\nTotal value for me = 82 + 39 + 11.5 + 200 + 105 = 437.5\n\nThis is less than my outside offer. I need to keep more for myself. Let's try offering less of the high-value items, and more of the low-value items.\n\nOffer: [3, 4, 1, 3, 3]\n\nItem 1: Keep 1. Value = 1 * 41 = 41\nItem 2: Keep 2. Value = 2 * 13 = 26\nItem 3: Keep 0. Value = 0 * 23 = 0\nItem 4: Keep 2. Value = 2 * 80 = 160\nItem 5: Keep 2. Value = 2 * 42 = 84\nTotal value for me = 41 + 26 + 0 + 160 + 84 = 311\n\nThis is worse. Now I know I need to offer less of item 4.\n\nOffer: [3, 5, 1, 1, 3]\n\nItem 1: Keep 1. Value = 1 * 41 = 41\nItem 2: Keep 1. Value = 1 * 13 = 13\nItem 3: Keep 0. Value = 0 * 23 = 0\nItem 4: Keep 4. Value = 4 * 80 = 320\nItem 5: Keep 2. Value = 2 * 42 = 84\nTotal value for me = 41 + 13 + 0 + 320 + 84 = 458\n\nStill less than my outside offer.\n\nOffer: [4, 6, 1, 0, 5] - give all the low value items and nothing of the high value ones\n\nItem 1: Keep 0. Value = 0 * 41 = 0\nItem 2: Keep 0. Value = 0 * 13 = 0\nItem 3: Keep 0. Value = 0 * 23 = 0\nItem 4: Keep 5. Value = 5 * 80 = 400\nItem 5: Keep 0. Value = 0 * 42 = 0\nTotal value for me = 400\n\nThis isn't good. Keep items 4 and 5 and giving up the rest.\n\nOffer [4, 6, 1, 0, 0]\n\nItem 1: Keep 0. Value = 0 * 41 = 0\nItem 2: Keep 0. Value = 0 * 13 = 0\nItem 3: Keep 0. Value = 0 * 23 = 0\nItem 4: Keep 5. Value = 5 * 80 = 400\nItem 5: Keep 5. Value = 5 * 42 = 210\nTotal value for me = 610\n\nOkay, this is significantly better. This is a good starting point.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 6, 1, 0, 0]}\n```",

However, I need to give Player 1 enough to be better than their outside offer. Since I don't know their values or outside offer, I will aim for a somewhat balanced split and see if I can get them to accept.\n\nLet's propose giving Player 1 half the items where possible.

Since I am aiming to maximize my value, and I don't know Player 1's valuation, I will propose a counteroffer in hopes of getting a better outcome than simply walking away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 3, 0, 2, 2]}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 4, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    41 x 0 + 13 x 0 + 23 x 0 + 80 x 4 + 42 x 4\n    which is 488 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 489. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [4, 6, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 3, 0, 2, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 3, 0, 2, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

This means accepting an offer in round 2 is slightly less valuable than accepting it in round 1 (multiplying by 0.98). Accepting in round 3 is worse still (0.98^2).\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [2, 3, 0, 2, 2]. This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 4 - 2 = 2\n    *   Item 2: 6 - 3 = 3\n    *   Item 3: 1 - 0 = 1\n    *   Item 4: 5 - 2 = 3\n    *   Item 5: 5 - 2 = 3\n    My value from accepting the current offer is: (2 * 41) + (3 * 13) + (1 * 23) + (3 * 80) + (3 * 42) = 82 + 39 + 23 + 240 + 126 = 510.\n\n    Since this is round 2, the discounted value is 510 * 0.98^(2-1) = 510 * 0.98 = 499.8\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** 499.8 > 489. Accepting the current offer is better than walking away.\n\n3) **Consider a counteroffer:**\n\nBefore accepting, let's consider if a better counteroffer exists. The current offer gives me a value of 499.8.\nLet's calculate the total possible value from all items: (4 * 41) + (6 * 13) + (1 * 23) + (5 * 80) + (5 * 42) = 164 + 78 + 23 + 400 + 210 = 875.\n\nLet's look at the offer in round 1 to Player 2 which was [4, 6, 1, 0, 0]. This would give me 0. The current offer I'm considering gives them [2, 3, 0, 2, 2]. So, this must have been the best offer I could make in round 1. \n\nSince the current offer is better than my outside option, I should accept it. There's a risk that if I make another counteroffer it won't be accepted and I would have to walk. \n\n**Decision:**\n\nI will accept the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 1, 0, 3, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    92 x 3 + 33 x 1 + 31 x 0 + 26 x 3 + 55 x 0\n    which is 387 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 388. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

So let's consider if there is a possible deal that I could make that could yield more than 409 for me.\n\nTo maximize my value, I want to keep items 4 and 5 since I value them the most. I would be okay with giving up items 1, 2, and 3. Suppose I offer Player 1 the following:\n\nItem 1: 2\nItem 2: 1\nItem 3: 1\nItem 4: 0\nItem 5: 0\n\nThis means I keep:\nItem 1: 1\nItem 2: 1\nItem 3: 1\nItem 4: 3\nItem 5: 3\n\nThe value of this allocation to me is:\n(1 * 45) + (1 * 28) + (1 * 47) + (3 * 90) + (3 * 54) = 45 + 28 + 47 + 270 + 162 = 552\n\nApplying the discount factor, I would get 552 * 0.98 = 540.96\n\nSince 540.96 > 409, it is worth making this counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 1, 0, 0]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 1, 0, 3, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    92 x 3 + 33 x 1 + 31 x 0 + 26 x 3 + 55 x 0\n    which is 387 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 388. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

I need to decide whether to walk away or make a counteroffer.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I keep almost everything and offer Player 1 a small amount.\nI have 4 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 5 of item 3, 5 of item 4, and 3 of item 5. Total value = (4*96) + (4*82) + (5*68) + (5*65) + (3*93) = 384 + 328 + 340 + 325 + 279 = 1656\n\nLet's try to find a beneficial split. I'll start by proposing a more reasonable split, giving the other player a bit more: giving 1 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 1 of item 5.\n\nThat offer would look like this: [1, 1, 2, 1, 1]\n\nThis means I keep 3 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 4 of item 4, and 2 of item 5.\n\nMy value for that would be: (3 * 96) + (3 * 82) + (3 * 68) + (4 * 65) + (2 * 93) = 288 + 246 + 204 + 260 + 186 = 1184\n\nSince 1184 > 366, this is a better deal for me than walking away.\n\nTherefore, I will make this counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 2, 1, 1]}\n```",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 1082. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1082. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 789 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 4, 5, 5, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    42 x 4 + 79 x 4 + 34 x 5 + 78 x 5 + 30 x 1\n    which is 1074 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1082. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 2, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 2, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

This means accepting an offer in round 2 yields 0.98 * the value of the accepted offer.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer: Player 2 is offering me [1, 1, 2, 1, 1]. This means I would receive:\n     - 1 unit of item 1: 1 * 42 = 42\n     - 1 unit of item 2: 1 * 79 = 79\n     - 2 units of item 3: 2 * 34 = 68\n     - 1 unit of item 4: 1 * 78 = 78\n     - 1 unit of item 5: 1 * 30 = 30\n     Total value of current offer: 42 + 79 + 68 + 78 + 30 = 297\n     Value of current offer adjusted for discount factor: 297 * 0.98 = 291.06\n\n   - Potential counteroffers: I need to find a counteroffer that gives me more than 1082 * 0.98 = 1060.36.\n\n   The current offer on the table is [1, 1, 2, 1, 1] (what is being offered *to* me).

Then I offer [1, 0, 1, 1, 1] to Player 2.\n   Value for me:\n   3 * 42 + 4 * 79 + 4 * 34 + 4 * 78 + 2 * 30 = 126 + 316 + 136 + 312 + 60 = 950.\n\n   Still less than my outside offer and discounted outside offer.\n\n   Let's keep [4, 4, 3, 4, 2]. I offer [0, 0, 2, 1, 1].\n   4 * 42 + 4 * 79 + 3 * 34 + 4 * 78 + 2 * 30 = 168 + 316 + 102 + 312 + 60 = 958.\n\n   Okay, let's try to take as much of item 1 and 4 as possible: [4, 3, 3, 5, 2]. Offer [0, 1, 2, 0, 1].\n   Value: 4 * 42 + 3 * 79 + 3 * 34 + 5 * 78 + 2 * 30 = 168 + 237 + 102 + 390 + 60 = 957\n\n   What if I try to take all items of type 1, 2 and 4? [4, 4, 3, 5, 1]. I offer [0, 0, 2, 0, 2].\n   Value: 4 * 42 + 4 * 79 + 3 * 34 + 5 * 78 + 1 * 30 = 168 + 316 + 102 + 390 + 30 = 1006. Still below 1060.36\n\n   If I keep only [4, 4, 5, 5, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party, my offer to them is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. My value would be:\n   4 * 42 + 4 * 79 + 5 * 34 + 5 * 78 + 3 * 30 = 168 + 316 + 170 + 390 + 90 = 1134\n\n   So, I know there's *some* division where I get over 1060.36, but it looks like I have to offer *something*\n\n   Let's try keeping a division that gives me at least 1082/0.98 = 1104.08\n\n   I think I'll try offering them 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 0 of item 4, and 0 of item 5. I keep [4, 4, 4, 5, 3].\n   My value would be:\n   4 * 42 + 4 * 79 + 4 * 34 + 5 * 78 + 3 * 30 = 168 + 316 + 136 + 390 + 90 = 1100\n   Still below, but close.\n\n   Now I'll try offering them 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 0 of item 4, and 0 of item 5. I keep [4, 4, 5, 5, 3].\n   My value would be:\n   4 * 42 + 4 * 79 + 5 * 34 + 5 * 78 + 3 * 30 = 168 + 316 + 170 + 390 + 90 = 1134\n   Which discounted will be: 1134 * 0.98 = 1111.32\n\n   So, I will offer them [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 1, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    18 x 0 + 11 x 1 + 85 x 1 + 12 x 1 + 9 x 1\n    which is 117 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 118. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's start by analyzing the situation.\n\n1) **Analysis:**\n\n*   **Outside Offer Value:** 118\n*   **Item Values:** Item 1: 18, Item 2: 11, Item 3: 85, Item 4: 12, Item 5: 9\n*   **Total Items:** Item 1: 3, Item 2: 7, Item 3: 5, Item 4: 3, Item 5: 6\n*   **Discount Factor:** gamma = 0.98. This means that waiting for a future round reduces the value of any deal. In round 2, a deal's value is multiplied by 0.98, and in round 3, by 0.98^2 = 0.9604.\n\n2) **Initial Offer Considerations:**\n\nSince there is no current offer, I need to decide whether to WALK or make an initial offer. Walking away guarantees me 118.  I need to construct an offer that will be attractive to Player 2, while also giving me more than 118.  I will start by considering an even split and adjust from there.\n\n3) **Developing a Potential Offer:**\n\nLet's start by giving player 2 roughly half of the items and see what my value would be.\n\n*   Give Player 2: [1, 3, 2, 1, 3]\n*   Keep for myself: [2, 4, 3, 2, 3]\n*   My value: 2 * 18 + 4 * 11 + 3 * 85 + 2 * 12 + 3 * 9 = 36 + 44 + 255 + 24 + 27 = 386.\nSince 386 is greater than my outside offer, this offer will be much better than walking away.\n\nNow let's see if the opposite works:\n*   Give Player 2: [2, 4, 3, 2, 3]\n*   Keep for myself: [1, 3, 2, 1, 3]\n*   My value: 1 * 18 + 3 * 11 + 2 * 85 + 1 * 12 + 3 * 9 = 18 + 33 + 170 + 12 + 27 = 260.\nThis is also greater than my outside offer.\n\nLet's examine an even more favorable trade for myself:\n*   Give Player 2: [0, 1, 1, 0, 1]\n*   Keep for myself: [3, 6, 4, 3, 5]\n*   My value: 3 * 18 + 6 * 11 + 4 * 85 + 3 * 12 + 5 * 9 = 54 + 66 + 340 + 36 + 45 = 541.\nThis seems like a much better deal.\n\n*   Give Player 2: [3, 6, 4, 3, 5]\n*   Keep for myself: [0, 1, 1, 0, 1]\n*   My value: 0 * 18 + 1 * 11 + 1 * 85 + 0 * 12 + 1 * 9 = 0 + 11 + 85 + 0 + 9 = 105.\nThis is worse than my outside offer so it won't work.\n\nSince it is the first round, I will start with giving the other agent few items. I hope that they will make a counteroffer instead of walking away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 1, 0, 1]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 3, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    66 x 0 + 69 x 1 + 88 x 0 + 99 x 3 + 38 x 4\n    which is 518 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 519. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Player 2 gets what I don't keep.\n   - My value if I accept the current offer:\n      (4 * 66) + (1 * 69) + (3 * 88) + (1 * 99) + (3 * 38) = 264 + 69 + 264 + 99 + 114 = 810\n   - Since it is round 2, the discount factor applies: 810 * (0.98^(2-1)) = 810 * 0.98 = 793.8\n\n   - Potential counteroffers: I need to find an offer that gives me a value greater than my outside offer *discounted* by one round (519 * 0.98 = 508.62). I want to give away as little as possible, but not make an offer worse than my current one.\n\nLet's evaluate the previous offer I made in round 1 and compare it to my outside offer. In round 1 I offered [3, 2, 2, 2, 2] to player 2. That means I kept [4, 3, 2, 3, 3]. The value of keeping that is (4 * 66) + (3 * 69) + (2 * 88) + (3 * 99) + (3 * 38) = 264 + 207 + 176 + 297 + 114 = 1058. This offer was pretty generous. It is discounted in round 1 as 1058 * 1 = 1058\n\nThe current offer gives me a value of 793.8, which is greater than my outside offer of 519. The previous offer I made in round 1 had a value to me of 1058. This means I need to consider counteroffers that yield values between 519 and 1058.\n\nI want to be sure I avoid making mistake 1 by making an offer worse than the previous one. I also want to avoid mistake 2, by making an offer worse than my outside option. I will also want to avoid mistake 4 of accepting an offer worse than my outside offer discounted by one round. The current offer of 793.8 is well above my outside offer, so let's examine the current offer more.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - The current offer gives me a value of 793.8, which is greater than my outside offer (519).\n\nGiven that the current offer (Player 2 giving me [4, 1, 3, 1, 3]) results in a discounted value of 793.8, which is greater than my outside offer of 519, I should accept.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 338. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 933 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 2, 0, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    68 x 2 + 75 x 2 + 55 x 0 + 51 x 1 + 62 x 0\n    which is 337 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 338. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

This means that in round 2, the value is multiplied by 0.98, and in round 3, the value is multiplied by 0.98^2 = 0.9604. The discount factor encourages reaching an agreement earlier.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find an offer that gives Player 2 enough items to be attractive, while still leaving me with a value greater than my outside offer of 338. I need to consider the total value of all items: 4*68 + 5*75 + 4*55 + 3*51 + 2*62 = 272 + 375 + 220 + 153 + 124 = 1144\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince this is the first round, I should make a reasonable offer that leaves room for negotiation. I should avoid offering too little (risking a WALK) or too much (leaving value on the table). I should also ensure my remaining items after the offer are worth more than my outside option of 338. Let's try offering Player 2 half of the items (rounding where necessary).\n\nOffer: [2, 2, 2, 1, 1]\n\nMy remaining items: [2, 3, 2, 2, 1]\nMy value: 2*68 + 3*75 + 2*55 + 2*51 + 1*62 = 136 + 225 + 110 + 102 + 62 = 635\n\nThis offer looks good, since my value 635 is much higher than my outside offer 338.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 2, 1, 1]}\n```",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 188. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 188. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 822 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 0, 3, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    20 x 1 + 89 x 1 + 64 x 0 + 26 x 3 + 75 x 0\n    which is 187 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 188. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

I want to make an offer that is likely to be accepted, or at least lead to a negotiation that results in a good outcome for me. To start, I will try to offer approximately half of the total value to the other player to see their reaction.\nTo do that, I need to keep slightly more than my outside option, so I need to keep value slightly higher than 188.\nLet's try offering [2, 2, 1, 2, 2] to player 2.\nMy values will be:\nItem 1: 2 units * 20 = 40\nItem 2: 3 units * 89 = 267\nItem 3: 1 units * 64 = 64\nItem 4: 3 units * 26 = 78\nItem 5: 2 units * 75 = 150\nTotal value for me: 40 + 267 + 64 + 78 + 150 = 599\nThat's much greater than my outside offer, so this seems pretty good to begin.\nHere's the offer I will make: offer [2, 2, 1, 2, 2] to player 2.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 1, 2, 2]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 2, 2, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    78 x 0 + 65 x 0 + 5 x 2 + 27 x 2 + 49 x 0\n    which is 64 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 67. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 2, 2, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 3, 3, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 3, 3, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 67\n*   My values for items: item 1: 78, item 2: 65, item 3: 5, item 4: 27, item 5: 49\n*   Total items: 3 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5\n*   Discount factor: 0.98\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [1, 0, 3, 3, 3]. This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n    *   Item 2: 0 - 0 = 0 units\n    *   Item 3: 5 - 3 = 2 units\n    *   Item 4: 5 - 3 = 2 units\n    *   Item 5: 5 - 3 = 2 units\n    *   My value for this offer: (2 * 78) + (0 * 65) + (2 * 5) + (2 * 27) + (2 * 49) = 156 + 0 + 10 + 54 + 98 = 318\n    *   Since this is round 2, the value is discounted by 0.98^(2-1) = 0.98. Thus, the present value of accepting the current offer is 318 * 0.98 = 311.64.\n\n*   **Counteroffer:**  I need to consider a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 67 (my outside offer).\n\n    *   **Consider keeping everything:**  (3 * 78) + (0 * 65) + (5 * 5) + (5 * 27) + (5 * 49) = 234 + 0 + 25 + 135 + 245 = 639. This implies offering [0,0,0,0,0].\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer is worth 311.64, which is greater than my outside offer of 67. Therefore, accepting the current offer is better than walking away.\n*   However, it's only round 2. Can I do better with a counteroffer?  Let's try to get most of the value while still giving the other player something to avoid a walk.\n*   I want to maximize my profit and avoid the mistakes outlined above. A good strategy is to make a counteroffer that yields a high value while also incentivizing Player 2 to accept. Let's consider an offer that gives player 2 [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]. This means I keep 3 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5. The value of this offer for me is: (3 * 78) + (0 * 65) + (4 * 5) + (4 * 27) + (4 * 49) = 234 + 0 + 20 + 108 + 196 = 558. If this offer is accepted, my value would be 558 * 0.98 = 546.84\n*   Compared to the offer I am currently getting: 311.64, this counter offer seems better.\n\nTherefore, I will make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 3, 5, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    63 x 0 + 66 x 0 + 60 x 3 + 7 x 5 + 86 x 3\n    which is 473 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 474. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.98 times its face value, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 0.98^2 = 0.9604 times its face value. The discount factor incentivizes reaching an agreement sooner rather than later.\n\n2. **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   *   **Current offer:** There is no current offer.\n   *   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that is likely to be accepted by Player 2 and gives me a value greater than 474. I will start by constructing a somewhat fair split and see what I get. My total value for all items is (5 * 63) + (1 * 66) + (5 * 60) + (5 * 7) + (3 * 86) = 315 + 66 + 300 + 35 + 258 = 974\n\n3. **Making a decision:**\n\nI need to decide whether to WALK or make a COUNTEROFFER. I will start with a slightly aggressive counteroffer, offering Player 2 a little more than half of the total value, with the expectation they'll take less, and I'll end up with more than 474.\n\nLet's aim for Player 2 to have around 500 worth of items.\n* Item 1, give 3 items = 3 * 63 = 189\n* Item 3, give 2 items = 2 * 60 = 120\n* Item 5, give 2 items = 2 * 86 = 172\nTotal given value 189 + 120 + 172 = 481. Give player 2 Item 4 item.\n\n* Item 4, give 2 item = 2 * 7 = 14\nTotal given value 481 + 14 = 495.\n\nValue to self\nItem 1 (2) = 126\nItem 2 (1) = 66\nItem 3 (3) = 180\nItem 4 (3) = 21\nItem 5 (1) = 86\n\nTotal to self = 126+66+180+21+86 = 479\n\nThis is marginally better than my outside offer, so let's start with that.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 0, 2, 2, 2]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 3, 3, 2, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 3, 3, 2, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 4, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    14 x 0 + 80 x 0 + 46 x 0 + 14 x 4 + 68 x 2\n    which is 192 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 194. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

This means later rounds are slightly less valuable, but not significantly so in 3 rounds.\n\n2. **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - Current offer: None. I need to make an initial offer.\n   - Potential counteroffers: I need to consider what to offer Player 2 to maximize my value while ensuring they are likely to accept.\n\n3. **Develop a strategy and initial offer:**\n\n   - I want to make an offer that is attractive to Player 2 while ensuring my value remains above my outside offer of 194. I need to estimate Player 2's values and make an offer accordingly.\n   - Since I don't know Player 2's values, a reasonable starting point is to offer a roughly even split in terms of units, biasing towards items I value less.\n\nLet's start by calculating my value if I keep half of each item (rounding down where necessary):\n- item 1: keep 3 (3 * 14 = 42)\n- item 2: keep 1 (1 * 80 = 80)\n- item 3: keep 1 (1 * 46 = 46)\n- item 4: keep 4 (4 * 14 = 56)\n- item 5: keep 1 (1 * 68 = 68)\nTotal Value: 42 + 80 + 46 + 56 + 68 = 292\n\nThis is substantially better than my outside offer, so I can be a bit more generous to try and secure a deal quickly. I will try to give away more of items I value less. I will offer the other player [3, 1, 1, 4, 1]\nMy value would be:\nitem 1: keep 4 (4 * 14 = 56)\nitem 2: keep 2 (2 * 80 = 160)\nitem 3: keep 1 (1 * 46 = 46)\nitem 4: keep 4 (4 * 14 = 56)\nitem 5: keep 1 (1 * 68 = 68)\nTotal value: 56 + 160 + 46 + 56 + 68 = 386\nTherefore, I will offer the counter offer: [3, 1, 1, 4, 1].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 1, 1, 4, 1]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's start by analyzing the current situation:\n\n1) **Current Situation:**\n\n*   **Outside Offer:** My outside offer value is 1322.\n*   **Item Values:** My values for items 1-5 are 11, 56, 76, 98, and 45 respectively.\n*   **Total Items:** There are 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 9 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount Factor:** The discount factor is 0.98.\n\n2) **Assessing Offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that benefits me and is likely to be accepted by Player 2 (or at least gets the negotiation to a later round). I'll start by considering a relatively fair split and then adjust based on the responses. A perfectly even split isn't possible given the item counts, but I will aim for something in that direction as a first offer.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\nSince there's no current offer, I need to make an initial offer. I want to make a reasonable offer that Player 2 might accept, or at least consider, while still ensuring I get a good value. Here's my initial thought process. I want to determine what roughly half the total value of all items would be, and try and construct an offer that gives player 2 something that approaches that. I am only using my own item valuations at this stage.\n\nTotal value is 3*11 + 4*56 + 6*76 + 9*98 + 3*45 = 33 + 224 + 456 + 882 + 135 = 1730\n\nHalf of this value is 865.\n\nLet me first start by giving away half of everything possible.\n\nItem 1: give away 1\nItem 2: give away 2\nItem 3: give away 3\nItem 4: give away 4\nItem 5: give away 1\n\nvalue to me would be (3-1)*11 + (4-2)*56 + (6-3)*76 + (9-4)*98 + (3-1)*45 = 22 + 112 + 228 + 490 + 90 = 942\n\nValue to player 2 would be 1*11 + 2*56 + 3*76 + 4*98 + 1*45 = 11 + 112 + 228 + 392 + 45 = 788\n\nThe values are quite unequal. Let's try another offer. This time, I will offer slightly more in total quantity to Player 2.\n\nItem 1: 1\nItem 2: 2\nItem 3: 3\nItem 4: 5\nItem 5: 2\n\nvalue to me would be (3-1)*11 + (4-2)*56 + (6-3)*76 + (9-5)*98 + (3-2)*45 = 22 + 112 + 228 + 392 + 45 = 799\n\nValue to player 2 would be 1*11 + 2*56 + 3*76 + 5*98 + 2*45 = 11 + 112 + 228 + 490 + 90 = 931\n\nThis is getting closer. My outside offer is 1322. Giving away the following provides me 799. Giving away the following to player 2 is worth 931 to me.\n\nLet me try offering:\nItem 1: 0\nItem 2: 1\nItem 3: 2\nItem 4: 4\nItem 5: 0\n\nvalue to me would be (3-0)*11 + (4-1)*56 + (6-2)*76 + (9-4)*98 + (3-0)*45 = 33 + 168 + 304 + 490 + 135 = 1130\n\nValue to player 2 would be 0*11 + 1*56 + 2*76 + 4*98 + 0*45 = 0 + 56 + 152 + 392 + 0 = 600\n\nIf I offer the following:\nItem 1: 0\nItem 2: 0\nItem 3: 1\nItem 4: 3\nItem 5: 0\n\nvalue to me would be (3-0)*11 + (4-0)*56 + (6-1)*76 + (9-3)*98 + (3-0)*45 = 33 + 224 + 380 + 588 + 135 = 1360\n\nValue to player 2 would be 0*11 + 0*56 + 1*76 + 3*98 + 0*45 = 0 + 0 + 76 + 294 + 0 = 370\n\nMy valuation is now more than my outside offer.\n\nI will now make the following offer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 3, 0]}\n",

I need to decide how much of each item to offer Player 1.\n\nA simple strategy is to offer the other player close to what they asked for plus a bit of items I value less.\nSince the value of the current offer is only 180, let's give the other player half of the items plus what they initially asked for.\n\nMy counteroffer:\n\nItem 1: 1\nItem 2: 2\nItem 3: 4\nItem 4: 6\nItem 5: 1\n\nThis leaves me with\nItem 1: 2 * 73 = 146\nItem 2: 2 * 36 = 72\nItem 3: 2 * 12 = 24\nItem 4: 3 * 56 = 168\nItem 5: 2 * 92 = 184\nTotal value = 146 + 72 + 24 + 168 + 184 = 594\n\nThis value, 594, is still below my outside option of 1083.\n\nI'll need to offer the other player something significant to reach an agreement.

Let's consider offering the other player:\nItem 1: 1\nItem 2: 2\nItem 3: 3\nItem 4: 4\nItem 5: 1\n\nThis would leave me with:\nItem 1: 2 * 73 = 146\nItem 2: 2 * 36 = 72\nItem 3: 3 * 12 = 36\nItem 4: 5 * 56 = 280\nItem 5: 2 * 92 = 184\nTotal = 146+72+36+280+184 = 718\n\nThis is still significantly below my outside offer.\n\nSince it's round 1, and I want to avoid walking away prematurely, I will make a counteroffer that gives them most of the items I don't value much, and hope they value those more than I do.\n\nItem 1: 0\nItem 2: 0\nItem 3: 5\nItem 4: 6\nItem 5: 0\nThis leaves me with:\n\nItem 1: 3 * 73 = 219\nItem 2: 4 * 36 = 144\nItem 3: 1 * 12 = 12\nItem 4: 3 * 56 = 168\nItem 5: 3 * 92 = 276\nTotal: 219+144+12+168+276 = 819\n\nI will choose this as it has a good chance of making a deal.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 5, 6, 0]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 4, 9, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    11 x 0 + 56 x 0 + 76 x 4 + 98 x 9 + 45 x 3\n    which is 1321 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1322. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This means Player 2 keeps:\n    *   Item 1: 3 - 0 = 3\n    *   Item 2: 4 - 0 = 4\n    *   Item 3: 6 - 5 = 1\n    *   Item 4: 9 - 6 = 3\n    *   Item 5: 3 - 0 = 3\n\n    My value for the current offer: (3 * 11) + (4 * 56) + (1 * 76) + (3 * 98) + (3 * 45) = 33 + 224 + 76 + 294 + 135 = 762. This is less than my outside offer of 1322.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find an offer that gives me a value greater than 1322. Let's start by considering what it would take to get close to my maximum possible value. If I kept everything, my value would be (3 * 11) + (4 * 56) + (6 * 76) + (9 * 98) + (3 * 45) = 33 + 224 + 456 + 882 + 135 = 1730. Since 762 < 1322 < 1730, I should attempt to counteroffer.

This is less than my outside offer of 1322, therefore is Mistake #2.\n\nLet's evaluate keeping [3, 4, 4, 7, 3] giving [0, 0, 2, 2, 0] to player 2.\nMy value = (3 * 11) + (4 * 56) + (4 * 76) + (7 * 98) + (3 * 45) = 33 + 224 + 304 + 686 + 135 = 1382.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1083. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player1, 2 units of each item (keeping 2 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 807 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 1, 3, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 5, 6, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 2, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 2, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the optimal action.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the value of the current offer to me: [0, 0, 2, 2, 0]. This means I would receive 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n\nValue of current offer:\n* Item 1: 0 * 73 = 0\n* Item 2: 0 * 36 = 0\n* Item 3: 2 * 12 = 24\n* Item 4: 2 * 56 = 112\n* Item 5: 0 * 92 = 0\nTotal value = 0 + 0 + 24 + 112 + 0 = 136\n\nSince this is round 2, the discount factor is 0.98^(2-1) = 0.98.\nDiscounted value of current offer = 136 * 0.98 = 133.28\n\nMy outside offer is worth 1083.  Since 133.28 is much less than 1083, I would prefer to walk away *unless* I can make a counteroffer that is better than 1083 *and* acceptable to Player 1. It is now round 2, and thus after this round only Player 1 will take an action, so any counteroffer I give must give a deal to Player 1 that they will find acceptable.\n\nLet's consider making a counteroffer. My goal is to maximize my value while ensuring Player 1 accepts. The total items available are 3 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 6 of item 3, 9 of item 4, and 3 of item 5.\n\nSince Player 1 offered me [0, 0, 2, 2, 0], and I offered them [0, 0, 5, 6, 0], it's likely Player 1 values item 3 and 4. However, I value item 5 most highly. Let's try to give them items 3 and 4 while keeping the majority of item 5.\n\nLet's offer Player 1 all of items 3 and 4, and none of the other items. This gives Player 1 [0, 0, 6, 9, 0]. What is my value if I do this? It gives me [3, 4, 0, 0, 3].\n\nMy value calculation:\n* Item 1: 3 * 73 = 219\n* Item 2: 4 * 36 = 144\n* Item 3: 0 * 12 = 0\n* Item 4: 0 * 56 = 0\n* Item 5: 3 * 92 = 276\nTotal value = 219 + 144 + 0 + 0 + 276 = 639\n\nDiscounted value = 639 * 0.98 = 626.22\n\nThis is still much less than my outside option, 1083. It's clear that I cannot get a better value from negotiating than I get from walking away. I must then WALK.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 4, 2, 2, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    84 x 0 + 67 x 4 + 37 x 2 + 38 x 2 + 57 x 5\n    which is 703 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 704. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

This means that waiting until later rounds reduces the value of any deal.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer, so accepting is not an option.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to propose a counteroffer. Let's consider a few options to find a reasonable starting point. Since it is round 1, I can propose a counteroffer that is aggressive.\n\nLet's calculate the value of keeping half the items to myself and giving half to the other player as an example. Note that this will not be precisely equal, given integer constraints on the number of units available.\n\n*   Item 1: Keep 3, Offer 3. Value of keeping: 3 * 84 = 252\n*   Item 2: Keep 3, Offer 3. Value of keeping: 3 * 67 = 201\n*   Item 3: Keep 1, Offer 1. Value of keeping: 1 * 37 = 37\n*   Item 4: Keep 1, Offer 2. Value of keeping: 1 * 38 = 38\n*   Item 5: Keep 2, Offer 3. Value of keeping: 2 * 57 = 114\n*   Total value: 252 + 201 + 37 + 38 + 114 = 642\n\nThis is less than my outside offer. So, I should offer less to the other player and keep more for myself.\n\nLet's calculate the value of keeping more items to myself and giving the remaining to the other player:\nOffer: [2, 2, 1, 2, 3] (This is what I am offering to the other player)\n*   Item 1: Keep 4, Offer 2. Value of keeping: 4 * 84 = 336\n*   Item 2: Keep 4, Offer 2. Value of keeping: 4 * 67 = 268\n*   Item 3: Keep 1, Offer 1. Value of keeping: 1 * 37 = 37\n*   Item 4: Keep 1, Offer 2. Value of keeping: 1 * 38 = 38\n*   Item 5: Keep 2, Offer 3. Value of keeping: 2 * 57 = 114\n*   Total value: 336 + 268 + 37 + 38 + 114 = 793\n\nThis exceeds my outside offer. It's a reasonable starting point.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   I should not accept since there is no current offer.\n*   I should not walk away since a deal is possible.\n*   I should propose a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 1, 2, 3]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 4, 2, 2, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    84 x 0 + 67 x 4 + 37 x 2 + 38 x 2 + 57 x 5\n    which is 703 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 704. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 1, 2, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 2, 1, 2, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 2, 1, 2, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step to determine the best course of action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 704.\n   - My values for the items are: item 1 = 84, item 2 = 67, item 3 = 37, item 4 = 38, item 5 = 57.\n   - The total pool of items is: item 1 = 6, item 2 = 6, item 3 = 2, item 4 = 3, item 5 = 5.\n   - The discount factor is 0.98. Since we're in round 2, accepting now means my value is multiplied by 0.98^(2-1) = 0.98. Waiting for round 3 means a discount of 0.98^2 = 0.9604.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** I am offered [2, 2, 1, 2, 2]. This means I keep:\n      - Item 1: 6 - 2 = 4 units\n      - Item 2: 6 - 2 = 4 units\n      - Item 3: 2 - 1 = 1 unit\n      - Item 4: 3 - 2 = 1 unit\n      - Item 5: 5 - 2 = 3 units\n      My value for accepting this offer is: (4 * 84) + (4 * 67) + (1 * 37) + (1 * 38) + (3 * 57) = 336 + 268 + 37 + 38 + 171 = 850.\n      Considering the discount factor, the present value of accepting now is 850 * 0.98 = 833.\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider possible counteroffers that are better than my outside offer.\n   - **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer, if accepted, gives me a value of 833, which is greater than my outside offer of 704.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince the current offer (once discounted) gives me a value of 833, which is significantly higher than my outside offer of 704, accepting the offer is a good option. Walking away would be a mistake. Now I need to see if making a counteroffer could yield a better outcome. The current offer on the table is player 2 offering me [2,2,1,2,2]. In the first round player 1 offered player 2 [2,2,1,2,3]. In response, player 2 offered me [2,2,1,2,2], so player 2 made an offer less generous for himself. Given this information, player 2 likely values item 5 higher than I do.\n\nLet's consider if I can get a better deal. I need to give the other player less to improve my outcome. What if I offered [1,1,0,1,1]? That would leave me with:\nItem 1: 6 - 1 = 5 units\nItem 2: 6 - 1 = 5 units\nItem 3: 2 - 0 = 2 unit\nItem 4: 3 - 1 = 2 unit\nItem 5: 5 - 1 = 4 units\nMy value for this offer is: (5 * 84) + (5 * 67) + (2 * 37) + (2 * 38) + (4 * 57) = 420 + 335 + 74 + 76 + 228 = 1133.\nDiscounting for round 2 gives 1133 * 0.98 = 1110.34. This is much better than accepting the current offer. However, the other player might walk away, and I'll get 704.\n\nAnother counteroffer could be [2, 2, 0, 2, 1].\nItem 1: 6 - 2 = 4 units\nItem 2: 6 - 2 = 4 units\nItem 3: 2 - 0 = 2 unit\nItem 4: 3 - 2 = 1 unit\nItem 5: 5 - 1 = 4 units\nMy value for this offer is: (4 * 84) + (4 * 67) + (2 * 37) + (1 * 38) + (4 * 57) = 336 + 268 + 74 + 38 + 228 = 944.\nDiscounting for round 2 gives 944 * 0.98 = 925.12.\n\nNow I need to make a decision if I want to counteroffer or accept. Since 833 is already much better than my outside offer of 704, I should accept.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

I need to consider what would be a reasonable offer to Player 2 while still maximizing my own value, keeping in mind my outside offer.\n\nI will start by creating a counteroffer that gives Player 2 a \"fair\" share of the items, which I will define as close to half of the total value of the items. The total value of all items to me is:\n(3 * 27) + (4 * 53) + (3 * 32) + (2 * 59) + (4 * 51) = 81 + 212 + 96 + 118 + 204 = 711\n\nHalf of this value is 355.5.
