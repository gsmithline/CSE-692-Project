Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 95. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 585 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 4, 3, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    48 x 0 + 52 x 0 + 18 x 4 + 7 x 3 + 70 x 0\n    which is 93 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 95. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

This means that any payoff I get now is worth more than the same payoff if I get it in a future round. Thus, delaying a deal decreases its value slightly due to the discount.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the value of offers\n\n#### Current Offer\n\n- Current offer (the amount of each item being offered to me): [3, 2, 1, 1, 3]\n  - Value calculation:\n    - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144\n    - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 52 = 104\n    - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 18 = 18\n    - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 7 = 7\n    - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210\n  - Total value = 144 + 104 + 18 + 7 + 210 = 483\n  - Considering the discount factor in round 2, adjusted value = 483 \u00d7 0.98 = 473.34\n\n#### Potential Counteroffers\n\n- Any counteroffer should provide me a value greater than my outside offer of 95, and ideally, better than the current offer after adjustment.\n\n### Step 3: Make a decision based on the analysis\n\n- **Should I accept the current offer?**\n  - The current adjusted value of 473.34 is significantly greater than my outside offer of 95. Therefore, it would be wise to accept this offer.\n\n- **Should I walk away and take my outside offer?**\n  - No, because the current offer's value after adjustment (473.34) is much better than the outside offer of 95.\n\n- **Should I propose a specific counteroffer?**\n  - Given that the current offer provides significantly more value and there is a risk of not getting an equally good offer later, a counteroffer might not be beneficial unless I have strong reason to believe Player 2 would accept a significantly better division.\n\nBased on this analysis, the best action is to accept the current offer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 284. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 603 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 2, 3, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    85 x 0 + 73 x 2 + 25 x 2 + 7 x 3 + 11 x 6\n    which is 283 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 284. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 2, 3, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    85 x 0 + 73 x 2 + 25 x 2 + 7 x 3 + 11 x 6\n    which is 283 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 284. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 1, 4, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 2, 0, 8, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 0, 8, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 0, 0, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    30 x 1 + 99 x 1 + 27 x 0 + 69 x 0 + 31 x 4\n    which is 253 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 255. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

I could try to get some of item 4 as well.\n\nPotential counteroffer: Give Player 1 [1, 0, 0, 3, 0] (keeping [3, 3, 4, 4, 0] for myself)\nValue calculation if I keep these units:\n- 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78\n- 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144\n- 4 units of item 3 = 4 \u00d7 72 = 288\n- 4 units of item 4 = 4 \u00d7 66 = 264\n- 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 18 = 0\nTotal value = 774\n\nThis would be even better for me. However, I need to be careful not to be too greedy.

Since we are in round 2, the current value would be multiplied by gamma to the power of (2-1) = 0.98. Computing with discount should be done when comparing offers or deciding.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer on the Table**: [1, 0, 0, 3, 0] (meaning I receive 3 units of item 4 and 1 unit of item 1)\n  - My value if I accept:\n    - Item 1: 1 \u00d7 64 = 64\n    - Item 4: 3 \u00d7 91 = 273\n  - Total value without discount = 64 + 273 = 337\n  - Total value with discount = 337 \u00d7 0.98 = 330.26\n\n- **Comparison with Outside Offer**: \n  - Current offer value (330.26) is higher than the outside offer value (159).\n\n### Step 3: Decision Making\n\n- **Should I Accept the Current Offer?**\n  - Yes, because the current offer provides a value (330.26) significantly greater than my outside offer value (159).\n\n- **Potential Counteroffer?**\n  - Any counteroffer must be better than what I would accept currently or potentially what Player 2 might accept, which seems unneeded as the proposed offer is already above my outside expectation significantly.\n\n- **Should I Walk Away?**\n  - No, walking away would give me 159, significantly lower than 330.26.\n\nBased on the analysis above, accepting the current offer is the best action as it maximizes my value when compared to my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

This means offering 4 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 0 units of item 5 to Player 2. The value of items I keep would be:\n   - 0 unit of item 1: 0 \u00d7 6 = 0\n   - 4 units of item 2: 4 \u00d7 86 = 344\n   - 0 unit of item 3: 0 \u00d7 5 = 0\n   - 4 units of item 4: 4 \u00d7 59 = 236\n   - 3 units of item 5: 3 \u00d7 95 = 285\n   Total value = 0 + 344 + 0 + 236 + 285 = 865\n\n   Unfortunately, this is yet another value lower than 885, meaning it remains not acceptable.\n\nBy making another calculation:\n\n   Suppose now I try keeping a similar distribution across all items to avoid skewing the division to one or two items. I decide to keep 2 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5 for myself. This means offering 2 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5 to Player 2. The value of items I keep would be:\n   - 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 6 = 12\n   - 4 units of item 2: 4 \u00d7 86 = 344\n   - 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 5 = 10\n   - 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 59 = 177\n   - 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 95 = 190\n   Total value = 12 + 344 + 10 + 177 + 190 = 733\n\n   This still falls short of 885. \n\n   Finally I realize that these are futile attempts that will always fall short of my outside offer,  given the specific values I need to maximize. Therefore, there's a change in the strategy we can try: offer all items that have a lower value from my perspective, and ask for all of those with a larger value.\n\n   Calculate the value from all possible stages: \n   Suppose I want all high value items from my perspective and just leave the items of lower value--for the units that fit this new view more specifically. This means offering 0 units of item 2 and 5, and all others completely. The value of items I keep would be:\n   - 0 units of item 1: 0 \u00d7 6\n   - 4 units of item 2: 4 \u00d7 86 = 344 \n   - 0 units of item 3: 0 \u00d7 5 \n   - 5 units of item 4: 5 \u00d7 59 = 295\n   - 3 units of item 5: 3 \u00d7 95 = 285\n   Total value = 344 + 295 + 285 = 924 \n\n   This is potentially higher, and will exceed my outside offer value finally, and into a valid one indeed.  That forces us to ponder whether this indeed be the best forward vision respectfully.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis: \n   - Given that maintaining a certain selection of high items and refuse all not very useful ones upsets dispute language inadequacies overall, we seize the leverage organization approach but contemplate a disregard completion that satisfies contracts.\n   - This move protects against errors since this comes above offers yet initially71 would.  \n\nThus, our offer as finally put forth will put forward the following counteroffer decision:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 0, 4, 0, 0]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 552. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 681 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 4, 0, 3, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    45 x 3 + 38 x 4 + 25 x 0 + 88 x 3 + 31 x 0\n    which is 551 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 552. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 890. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 807 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 0, 2, 4, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    87 x 3 + 1 x 0 + 48 x 2 + 74 x 4 + 59 x 4\n    which is 889 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 890. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

                    "response": "To determine my action in this negotiation, I'll conduct a thorough analysis as per the guidelines:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer is 890.\n- **Values of Items:** My values for each item are:\n  - Item 1: 87\n  - Item 2: 1\n  - Item 3: 48\n  - Item 4: 74\n  - Item 5: 59\n- **Total Pool of Items:** The available items are:\n  - 3 units of Item 1\n  - 2 units of Item 2\n  - 3 units of Item 3\n  - 5 units of Item 4\n  - 4 units of Item 5\n- **Discount Factor:** There is a discount factor, gamma = 0.98, which means if we wait for further rounds, the value of the negotiation outcome to us is adjusted by this factor raised to the power of number of rounds completed.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\nSince there is no current offer from Player 2, I need to create an initial offer that will allow me to maximize my value while considering the risk of declining an advantageous outside offer.\n\n#### Calculate the Optimal Counteroffer Value:\n\n1. **Calculate Total Possible Value:**\n\n   \\[\n   (3 \\times 87) + (2 \\times 1) + (3 \\times 48) + (5 \\times 74) + (4 \\times 59) = 261 + 2 + 144 + 370 + 236 = 1013\n   \\]\n\n2. **Base Offer Strategy:**\n   - I want to propose a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 890, my outside offer, while retaining an appealing portion to Player 2.\n\nLet's propose an offer where I keep:\n\n- 3 of Item 1\n- 0 of Item 2\n- 3 of Item 3\n- 3 of Item 4\n- 3 of Item 5\n\nCalculation of Total Value of this Proposal:\n\n- Keeping 3 units of Item 1: \\(3 \\times 87 = 261\\)\n- Keeping 3 units of Item 3: \\(3 \\times 48 = 144\\)\n- Keeping 3 units of Item 4: \\(3 \\times 74 = 222\\)\n- Keeping 3 units of Item 5: \\(3 \\times 59 = 177\\)\n\nThis proposal evaluates to:\n\n\\[\n261 + 0 + 144 + 222 + 177 = 804\n\\]\n\nThis value is less than my outside offer of 890 and not acceptable. Therefore, I need to adjust the number of items to keep in order to reach a value that surpasses my outside offer.\n\n### Adjustments\n\nLet's adjust by increasing the number of Item 4 that I keep to 5 and Item 5 to 4.\n\n- Keeping all units for high-value items:\n  - 3 of Item 1\n  - 0 of Item 2\n  - 3 of Item 3\n  - 5 of Item 4\n  - 4 of Item 5\n\nCalculating this configuration:\n\n- 3 units of Item 1: \\(3 \\times 87 = 261\\)\n- 3 units of Item 3: \\(3 \\times 48 = 144\\)\n- 5 units of Item 4: \\(5 \\times 74 = 370\\)\n- 4 units of Item 5: \\(4 \\times 59 = 236\\)\n\nTotal proposed value:\n\n\\[\n261 + 0 + 144 + 370 + 236 = 1011\n\\]\n\nThis proposed configuration gives me a value of 1011, which is higher than my outside offer of 890.\n\nGiven the analysis above, my initial offer to Player 2 will be maintaining this configuration, where I keep all units of my high-value items:\n\n- Offering Player 2 all of Item 2.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nI will make an offer that maximizes my outcome beyond my outside offer.\n\n**Proposed Action:**\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]}",

                    "response": "To decide on the best action, let's walk through the steps outlined:\n\n1) **Analyze the Current Situation:**\n\n   - **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 890.\n   - **Values of Items:**\n     - Item 1: 87 per unit\n     - Item 2: 1 per unit\n     - Item 3: 48 per unit\n     - Item 4: 74 per unit\n     - Item 5: 59 per unit\n   - **Total Pool of Items:**\n     - 3 units of item 1\n     - 2 units of item 2\n     - 3 units of item 3\n     - 5 units of item 4\n     - 4 units of item 5\n   - **Discount Factor:** The discount factor is 0.98. Since we are in round 2, we need to multiply the outcome by \\(0.98^{1} = 0.98\\) to compare it to the outside offer effectively.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n\n   - **Current Offer:** [0, 0, 3, 1, 1]\n     - Value calculation:\n       - 0 units of item 1 = 0\n       - 0 units of item 2 = 0\n       - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144\n       - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 74 = 74\n       - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 59 = 59\n     - Total value without discount: \\(144 + 74 + 59 = 277\\)\n     - Total value with discount: \\(277 \\times 0.98 = 271.46\\)\n\n   - **Potential Counteroffers:**\n     - Need to propose an offer where my remaining value is above 890 after subtracting the value assigned to player 2's share.\n\n3) **Make a Decision Based on Analysis:**\n\n   - **Current Offer Evaluation:** Accepting the current offer yields a value of 271.46 to me. This is less than my outside offer of 890, even without discount considerations. Thus, accepting this is not advisable.\n   - **Walking Away:** Walking away guarantees me a value of 890, which is better than the value of accepting the current offer.\n   - **Counteroffer Evaluation:** I need to construct an offer that results in a higher value than 890 while ensuring some of the items are allocated to Player 2.\n\n   Let's consider a potential counteroffer. If I keep [3, 2, 2, 4, 3] items for myself, my remaining value would be:\n\n   - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261\n   - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 1 = 2\n   - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 48 = 96\n   - 4 units of item 4 = 4 \u00d7 74 = 296\n   - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177\n   - Total value without discount = \\(261 + 2 + 96 + 296 + 177 = 832\\)\n\n   However, this is still below my outside offer value. So let\u2019s adjust: If I keep [3, 0, 3, 3, 3] items, and offer [0, 2, 0, 2, 1] to Player 2:\n\n   - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261\n   - 0 units of item 2 = 0\n   - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144\n   - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 74 = 222\n   - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177\n   - Total value without discount = \\(261 + 0 + 144 + 222 + 177 = 804\\)\n\n   Post discount in round 2: \\(804 \\times 0.98 = 787.92\\), which is still less than 890.\n\n   Counteroffer Proposal: [0, 1, 0, 2, 1] to Player 2 means I keep [3, 1, 3, 3, 3]\n\n   - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261\n   - 1 units of my item 2 = 1 \u00d7 1 = 1\n   - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144\n   - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 74 = 222\n   - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177\n\n   Total value without discount = \\(261 + 1 + 144 + 222 + 177 = 805\\)\n\n   Post discount in round 2: \\(805 \\times 0.98 = 788.9\\), still less than 890.\n\n   Finally, an even better configuration is for me to take [3, 1, 3, 4, 3] and offer [0, 1, 0, 1, 1]: \n\n   - 3 units of item 1 = 261\n   - 1 unit of item 2 = 1\n   - 3 units of item 3 = 144\n   - 4 units of item 4 = 296\n   - 3 units of item 5 = 177\n\n   Total value without discount = \\(261 + 1 + 144 + 296 + 177 = 879\\), but higher than earlier options thus getting discounted to \\(879 \\times 0.98 = 861.42\\).\n\nUltimately, it appears holding for a better context or outside offer is better maximizing my outcome:\n\nThus, the best course is to decide to WALK, taking advantage of my guaranteed fallback offer over presenting suboptimal counteroffers in this situation:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 1, 1, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    51 x 1 + 59 x 0 + 26 x 1 + 89 x 1 + 95 x 2\n    which is 356 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 357. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 3, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 742. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 742. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1005 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 7, 2, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    91 x 3 + 47 x 7 + 69 x 2 + 90 x 0 + 38 x 0\n    which is 740 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 742. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 1, 1, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 2, 0, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 0, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Thus, it's crucial to negotiate a deal sooner rather than later to maximize payoff.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n- Since there is no current offer on the table, I'll assess potential counteroffers.\n- I will ensure that any offer I accept or propose is valued higher than my outside offer of 1020, to avoid mistakes like Mistake 2 or Mistake 4.\n\n**Calculating a potential offer where I keep the most high-valued items:**\n1. Attempt to maximize the items with high per-unit values while trying to surpass my outside offer value.\n2. Prioritize keeping those items which contribute most to the total value:\n\nTargeting to end up with at least 1020 in value. Let's consider keeping more of the high-value items:\n\n**Example counteroffer items I could keep/allocate:**\n\n- Item 1: 6 units (value = 6 * 95 = 570)\n- Item 2: 2 units (value = 2 * 10 = 20)\n- Item 3: 5 units (value = 5 * 89 = 445)\n- Item 4: 0 units (value = 0 * 93 = 0)\n- Item 5: 0 units (value = 0 * 65 = 0)\n\nTotal Value = 570 + 20 + 445 + 0 + 0 = 1035\n\nThis counteroffer retains more high-value items and is greater than my outside offer of 1020 dollars.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision Based on the Analysis:\n- Since this structure of keeping [6, 2, 5, 0, 0] units totals to 1035, which is better than walking away with 1020, I will propose it as a counteroffer.\n- I will avoid unacceptable proposals and ensure not to propose offers worth less than my fallback, which prevents Mistake 5.\n\nHere is my action plan:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 2, 5, 2]}\n```\n\nThis counteroffer gives Player 2 common low value units from my perspective, while I retain the higher valued items to maximize my payoff.",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 7, 5, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    29 x 0 + 42 x 1 + 87 x 7 + 16 x 5 + 34 x 1\n    which is 765 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 766. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 3, 2, 5, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 2, 1, 5, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To evaluate the situation and decide on the best course of action, let's proceed step by step:\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 390.\n   - The values of the items to me are as follows:\n     - Item 1: 30 per unit\n     - Item 2: 28 per unit\n     - Item 3: 53 per unit\n     - Item 4: 91 per unit\n     - Item 5: 24 per unit\n   - Total pool of items:\n     - Item 1: 2 units\n     - Item 2: 4 units\n     - Item 3: 4 units\n     - Item 4: 8 units\n     - Item 5: 3 units\n   - The discount factor is 0.98. This means if we reach an agreement in round 1, there's no discount. If it goes to round 2, values are multiplied by 0.98, and if it goes to round 3, values are multiplied by 0.98^2.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - There is no current offer on the table.\n   - I will consider potential counteroffers. I need to propose a division where the value to me is higher than my outside offer of 390, avoiding suboptimal proposals as mentioned in the mistakes.\n\nTo propose a counteroffer, I want to make sure it's better than my outside offer. Here's a possible counteroffer that gives me more value than my outside offer:\n\n   - My initial proposal: Give Player 2 [1, 2, 2, 5, 2]\n     - I keep: [1, 2, 2, 3, 1]\n     - Value to me:\n       - Item 1: 1 \u00d7 30 = 30\n       - Item 2: 2 \u00d7 28 = 56\n       - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 53 = 106\n       - Item 4: 3 \u00d7 91 = 273\n       - Item 5: 1 \u00d7 24 = 24\n     - Total value to me = 30 + 56 + 106 + 273 + 24 = 489\n\nThis proposal gives me a total value of 489, which is higher than my outside offer of 390, thus ensuring I'm making a strategic move.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - Since there is no current offer, I will make the initial offer that maximizes my value.\n\nSo my action is to make the following counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 2, 5, 2]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 3, 0, 6, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    39 x 1 + 44 x 3 + 7 x 0 + 56 x 6 + 14 x 0\n    which is 507 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 508. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 3, 8, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    69 x 2 + 76 x 3 + 27 x 8 + 27 x 2 + 98 x 2\n    which is 832 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 833. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To determine the appropriate action, let's go through the analysis step by step.\n\n### 1) Analyze the current situation:\n\n- **What is my outside offer value?**\n  - My outside offer value is 833.\n\n- **What are the values of the items involved?**\n  - Item 1: 69\n  - Item 2: 76\n  - Item 3: 27\n  - Item 4: 27\n  - Item 5: 98\n\n- **What is the total pool of items?**\n  - 2 units of item 1\n  - 7 units of item 2\n  - 8 units of item 3\n  - 2 units of item 4\n  - 2 units of item 5\n\n- **How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?**\n  - The discount factor \\( \\gamma = 0.98 \\) means that for each round delayed, the value of the outcome is multiplied by \\( \\gamma^{(r-1)} \\). Since we are in round 1, the discount factor does not yet reduce the value for me, but it is important to consider for subsequent rounds.\n\n### 2) Assess the value of offers:\n\n- **Current offer value:**\n  - There is currently no offer on the table since it is the first round, hence the value is not applicable.\n\n- **Potential counteroffers:**\n  - Let's calculate a division of items that aligns with maximizing my value and being above my outside offer value of 833.\n\n#### Proposal Calculation:\n\nTo maximize my value, I should consider keeping more of the higher-value items (according to my valuations). Let\u2019s consider a division:\n\n- If I keep all units of items 1, 4, 5 (higher value items), and distribute some of the others:\n\n  Let's propose the distribution keeping:\n  \n  - 2 units of item 1\n  - 3 units of item 2 \n  - 5 units of item 3\n  - 2 units of item 4\n  - 2 units of item 5\n\nMy value calculations:\n- Value from item 1: \\( 2 \\times 69 = 138 \\)\n- Value from item 2: \\( 3 \\times 76 = 228 \\)\n- Value from item 3: \\( 5 \\times 27 = 135 \\)\n- Value from item 4: \\( 2 \\times 27 = 54 \\)\n- Value from item 5: \\( 2 \\times 98 = 196 \\)\n\nTotal value: \\( 138 + 228 + 135 + 54 + 196 = 751 \\)\n\nThis is still lower than my outside offer of 833. Let's adjust, by keeping more of item 2 since it has significant value per item:\n\nKeep:\n- 2 units of item 1\n- 6 units of item 2\n- 2 units of item 3\n- 2 units of item 4\n- 2 units of item 5\n\nNew calculations:\n- Value from item 1: \\( 2 \\times 69 = 138 \\)\n- Value from item 2: \\( 6 \\times 76 = 456 \\)\n- Value from item 3: \\( 2 \\times 27 = 54 \\)\n- Value from item 4: \\( 2 \\times 27 = 54 \\)\n- Value from item 5: \\( 2 \\times 98 = 196 \\)\n\nTotal value: \\( 138 + 456 + 54 + 54 + 196 = 898 \\)\n\n### 3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n\n- The new proposal provides a value of 898, which is greater than my outside offer value of 833.\n- Thus, by offering Player 2 the remaining items, I secure a higher value for myself. \n\nTherefore, I will make the following counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 6, 0, 0]}\n```\n\nThis counteroffer implies offering Player 2 one unit of item 2 and six units of item 3, keeping the rest for myself.",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1096. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 837 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 4, 5, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    38 x 2 + 11 x 0 + 58 x 4 + 99 x 5 + 73 x 4\n    which is 1095 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1096. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Let's follow the outlined steps to analyze the situation and determine the best action.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **My outside offer value:** 1096\n- **Values of the items involved:**\n  - Item 1: 38 per unit\n  - Item 2: 11 per unit\n  - Item 3: 58 per unit\n  - Item 4: 99 per unit\n  - Item 5: 73 per unit\n\n- **Total pool of items:**\n  - 2 units of item 1\n  - 3 units of item 2\n  - 4 units of item 3\n  - 6 units of item 4\n  - 4 units of item 5\n\n- **Discount Factor:** As this is the first round, the discount factor will not diminish my value because \\( \\gamma^{(r-1)} = \\gamma^{0} = 1 \\).\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\nSince there is no current offer on the table made by Player 2 yet, I'll need to evaluate potential offers I could propose. \n\nTo maximize my value, I should aim to retain as much value as possible. I need to ensure that any counteroffer maintains a value to me that is higher than my outside offer of 1096. Here is one potential evaluation:\n\n- **Offer all items where the total value is greater than outside offer:**\n  \n  **Offer to Player 2:** [0, 3, 0, 1, 0] (keeping all units of items 1, 3, 5, and most of item 4)\n\n  - **Units I retain:** [2, 0, 4, 5, 4]\n    - Item 1: 2 units \u00d7 38 = 76\n    - Item 3: 4 units \u00d7 58 = 232\n    - Item 4: 5 units \u00d7 99 = 495\n    - Item 5: 4 units \u00d7 73 = 292\n\n  **Total value to me:** 76 + 232 + 495 + 292 = 1095\n\n  This total value is 1 point less than my outside offer, so I must retain value above 1096 by adjusting units held, or make a smaller offer to Player 2.\n\n  To achieve higher than 1096, I must revise the distribution:\n  \n  **Revised Offer to Player 2:** [0, 2, 0, 0, 1]\n  \n  - **Units I keep:** [2, 1, 4, 6, 3]\n    - Item 1: 2 units \u00d7 38 = 76\n    - Item 2: 1 unit \u00d7 11 = 11\n    - Item 3: 4 units \u00d7 58 = 232\n    - Item 4: 6 units \u00d7 99 = 594\n    - Item 5: 3 units \u00d7 73 = 219\n\n  **Total value to me:** 76 + 11 + 232 + 594 + 219 = 1132\n\nThis revised offer is above my outside offer of 1096.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nSince the proposed value I retain is 1132, I am above my outside offer baseline, and I need to ensure I'm avoiding all five mistakes.\n\nI'll proceed with making a counteroffer using the distribution that retains a value of 1132.\n\n**Proposed Counteroffer to Player 2:** [0, 2, 0, 0, 1]\n\nThis offer provides Player 2 with some units of less valuable items and keeps my retained value above my outside offer, ensuring I avoid mistakes and at least meet or improve on the offer.\n\n### My Action:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 0, 0, 1]}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

This means the value of the negotiation outcome is effectively reduced by this factor the longer the negotiation drags on. However, since this is the first round, the discount factor doesn't apply yet (gamma^(0) = 1).\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer Value**: There is no current offer on the table.\n\n- **Potential Counteroffers**: I will calculate the total value of potential offers to ensure they are more appealing than the outside offer.\n\nLet's start by proposing a division where I retain more valuable items to maximize my value above the outside offer:\n\nAssume I propose the following division:\n- I keep 1 unit of Item 1\n- I keep 1 unit of Item 2\n- I keep 1 unit of Item 3\n- I keep 3 units of Item 4\n- I keep 5 units of Item 5\n\nCalculation of my total value:\n- Item 1: 1 \u00d7 20 = 20\n- Item 2: 1 \u00d7 5 = 5\n- Item 3: 1 \u00d7 4 = 4\n- Item 4: 3 \u00d7 44 = 132\n- Item 5: 5 \u00d7 47 = 235\n\nTotal Value = 20 + 5 + 4 + 132 + 235 = 396\n\n396 is well above my outside offer of 99. This avoids the mistakes of making an offer worse than my outside offer and ensures a significant margin for negotiation.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nSince my computed total value of 396 exceeds my outside offer and gives me a strong opening position, my initial offer can be formulated as:\n\n- Offer [4, 4, 5, 4, 5] to Player 2, meaning:\n  - Offer 4 units of Item 1\n  - Offer 4 units of Item 2\n  - Offer 5 units of Item 3\n  - Offer 4 units of Item 4\n  - Offer 5 units of Item 5\n\nThis proposal provides a significant buffer over my outside offer and ensures a strategic start to the negotiation.\n\n### Action Conclusion\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 4, 5, 4, 5]}",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    70 x 0 + 87 x 0 + 100 x 0 + 57 x 1 + 76 x 3\n    which is 285 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 286. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [4, 4, 5, 4, 5]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [4, 4, 5, 4, 5]\n\n    What is your action?

While I could counteroffer to try to get even more value, the risk of Player 1 walking away seems unwise. The current offer gives me most of the high-value items that matter to me, especially item 3.\n\nHowever, making a reasonable counteroffer that still gives me good value is the standard negotiation approach in the first round. My counteroffer of [2, 2, 1, 4, 5] gives me a value of 1,522, which is still excellent compared to my outside offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 1, 4, 5]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1490. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 720 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 6, 6, 7, 7] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    33 x 2 + 15 x 6 + 11 x 6 + 81 x 7 + 100 x 7\n    which is 1489 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1490. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 3, 3, 4, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 3, 3, 4, 4]\n\n    What is your action?

However, since it is just round 1, the discount's impact is minimal at this point.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **For the current offer (if any):** There is no current offer yet.\n   - **For potential counteroffers:** I need to propose an initial offer that maximizes my value while considering my outside offer. My goal is to propose something that gives me a value higher than my outside offer of 786.\n  \n   I'll aim to keep more of the items that hold higher value for me, such as items 2 and 5. Let's consider an initial allocation where I keep 6 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 7 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5. Player 2 will receive the rest.\n\n   - My proposed allocation for Player 2: [3, 1, 4, 2, 3]\n\n   Now let's calculate my value with these allocations:\n   - Item 1: \\(6 \\times 44 = 264\\)\n   - Item 2: \\(3 \\times 70 = 210\\)\n   - Item 3: \\(0 \\times 9 = 0\\)\n   - Item 4: \\(7 \\times 3 = 21\\)\n   - Item 5: \\(1 \\times 50 = 50\\)\n   - Total value for me: \\(264 + 210 + 0 + 21 + 50 = 545\\)\n\n   Comparing 545 with my outside offer of 786 indicates that the value is too low, so I need to keep more valuable items. Adjustments will be needed.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - Since the proposed division doesn't provide a value better than my outside offer, I need to re-evaluate and propose a revised offer.\n   - I aim for an initial offer that maximizes my payoff without dropping below the outside offer value.\n\n   Let's modify the offer: Keep 9 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 8 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5. Therefore, Player 2 receives: [0, 0, 4, 1, 3]\n   \n   Re-calculate my value:\n   - Item 1: \\(9 \\times 44 = 396\\)\n   - Item 2: \\(4 \\times 70 = 280\\)\n   - Item 3: \\(0 \\times 9 = 0\\)\n   - Item 4: \\(8 \\times 3 = 24\\)\n   - Item 5: \\(1 \\times 50 = 50\\)\n   - Total value for me: \\(396 + 280 + 0 + 24 + 50 = 750\\)\n\n  While this is slightly lower than my outside offer, balance is needed between maximizing value and flexibility for future counteroffers from Player 2.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [9, 2, 3, 9, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    39 x 9 + 33 x 2 + 64 x 3 + 99 x 9 + 68 x 4\n    which is 1772 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1774. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 4, 1, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 4, 1, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [9, 2, 3, 9, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    39 x 9 + 33 x 2 + 64 x 3 + 99 x 9 + 68 x 4\n    which is 1772 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1774. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 4, 1, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 2, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 5, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 0, 5, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",

However, I need to keep enough to be above my outside offer.\n   \n   One more adjustment:\n   - 9 units of item 1 (give 0)\n   - 4 units of item 2 (give 0) \n   - 3 units of item 3 (give 1)\n   - 9 units of item 4 (give 0)\n   - 3 units of item 5 (give 1)\n   \n   My value would be:\n   9 \u00d7 39 + 4 \u00d7 33 + 3 \u00d7 64 + 9 \u00d7 99 + 3 \u00d7 68 = \n   351 + 132 + 192 + 891 + 204 = 1770\n   \n   With discount: 1770 \u00d7 0.98 = 1735 (rounded)\n   \n   This is less than my outside offer, but still close. If it gets accepted in the next round, there would be another discount.\n\nBased on my analysis, I should make a counteroffer where I keep the high-value items for myself. Since this is the second round, I need to be more generous to increase chances of acceptance.\n\nI'll propose giving Player 1:\n- 0 of item 1 (keeping all 9 for myself)\n- 0 of item 2 (keeping all 4 for myself)\n- 1 of item 3 (keeping 3 for myself)\n- 0 of item 4 (keeping all 9 for myself)\n- 1 of item 5 (keeping 3 for myself)\n\nThis gives me a value of 1770, which is slightly below my outside offer of 1774, but after applying the round 2 discount of 0.98, it becomes 1735, which is still better than walking away.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 0, 1]}",

Accepting offers sooner rather than later is advantageous in terms of maximizing value, but I must carefully consider offers relative to my outside offer.\n\n2) **Assessing Offers:**\n   - There is currently no offer on the table from Player 2, so I have to make an initial offer.\n   - My objective is to propose a division that ensures my value remains above my outside offer of 329.\n\n3) **Calculating Potential Offers:**\n   - To ensure a counteroffer better than my outside offer and avoid negotiating mistakes, I will craft an offer:\n\n     Let's consider keeping a mix of high-value items and lower-value items, while offering others to Player 2. Here is one potential division:\n     - Keep for myself: \n       - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 63 = 126\n       - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147\n       - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 2 = 2\n       - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 62 = 62\n       - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66\n     - Total value to me: 126 + 147 + 2 + 62 + 66 = 403\n\n   This proposed division gives me a total value of 403, which is greater than my outside offer of 329, ensuring I am not making Mistake 2 (offering worse than my outside offer). It also considers not giving away everything in the initial round (Mistake 3).\n\nBased on this strategy, I will make the following counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 1, 1, 2]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 352. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 762 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 1, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    58 x 0 + 28 x 1 + 13 x 1 + 95 x 2 + 60 x 2\n    which is 351 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 352. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 1, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 1, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 1, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    58 x 0 + 28 x 1 + 13 x 1 + 95 x 2 + 60 x 2\n    which is 351 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 352. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 1, 1, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 3, 1, 0, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 1, 1, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 1, 1, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 232. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 232. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 807 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 1, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    87 x 0 + 27 x 0 + 73 x 1 + 63 x 1 + 19 x 5\n    which is 231 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 232. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 4, 1, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 4, 0, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 4, 0, 4]\n\n    What is your action?

However, the current offer already on the table gives me more benefit than my best evaluated counteroffer.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision Based on the Analysis:\n\nIn this case, the best option is to accept the current offer, as it offers a high value that maximizes my outcome and avoids the risks of going into the next round where values drop further with the discount factor.\n\nTherefore, my action is:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 4, 3, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 605. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 948 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 4, 3, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    99 x 1 + 93 x 1 + 27 x 4 + 84 x 3 + 13 x 4\n    which is 604 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 605. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 3, 0, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 4, 3, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 4, 3, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To make a well-reasoned decision, let's walk through the steps:\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 605.\n   - My values per unit of the items are:\n     - Item 1: 99\n     - Item 2: 93\n     - Item 3: 27\n     - Item 4: 84\n     - Item 5: 13\n   - The total pool of items is: 4 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor, gamma, influences the value by reducing it if we decide to wait for future offers. Since this is round 2, the value of any deal concluded this round is multiplied by 0.98.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer from Player 2: [1, 4, 3, 0, 1]\n     - Value to me: \n       - Item 1: 1 x 99 = 99\n       - Item 2: 4 x 93 = 372\n       - Item 3: 3 x 27 = 81\n       - Item 4: 0 x 84 = 0\n       - Item 5: 1 x 13 = 13\n     - Total value = 99 + 372 + 81 + 0 + 13 = 565\n     - Discounted value = 565 * 0.98 = 553.7 (round to 554)\n   - My outside offer value is 605, which is higher than what I'm offered now (554).\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - I should not accept the current offer because its value (554) is less than my outside offer value (605).\n   - Walking away would allow me to fall back to my outside offer value, which is guaranteed at 605.\n   - I should propose a counteroffer that ensures my value is greater than 605.\n\nLet's make a counteroffer where I maximize the value for myself while maintaining a fair split to entice Player 2. Here's one such offer calculation:\n\nKeep [2, 1, 1, 1, 2] items for myself and offer the rest to Player 2.\n- Value for me:\n  - Item 1: 2 x 99 = 198\n  - Item 2: 1 x 93 = 93\n  - Item 3: 1 x 27 = 27\n  - Item 4: 1 x 84 = 84\n  - Item 5: 2 x 13 = 26\n- Total value = 198 + 93 + 27 + 84 + 26 = 428\n- Since 428 is less than my outside offer, adjust.\n\nRe-evaluating by keeping [3, 0, 1, 2, 4] for myself:\n- Value for me:\n  - Item 1: 3 x 99 = 297\n  - Item 2: 0 x 93 = 0\n  - Item 3: 1 x 27 = 27\n  - Item 4: 2 x 84 = 168\n  - Item 5: 4 x 13 = 52\n\n- Total value = 297 + 0 + 27 + 168 + 52 = 544\n- Discounted = 544 * 0.98 = 533.12 \n\nThe value hasn't exceeded 605; thus, the safe action remains to WALK to secure my guaranteed alternative.\n\n**Decision:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",
