Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 105. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 105. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 438 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 0, 0, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    18 x 3 + 18 x 0 + 59 x 0 + 50 x 1 + 1 x 0\n    which is 104 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 105. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To make a decision in this negotiation, I need to analyze the situation, assess potential offers, and determine the most advantageous action based on my outside offer and the given constraints.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n- **Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer value is 105.\n- **Values of Items**:\n  - Item 1: 4 units; value per unit = 18\n  - Item 2: 0 units; value per unit = 18\n  - Item 3: 4 units; value per unit = 59\n  - Item 4: 1 unit; value per unit = 50\n  - Item 5: 4 units; value per unit = 1\n- **Total Pool of Items**: [4, 0, 4, 1, 4]\n\n- **Discount Factor Influence**: The discount factor (gamma = 0.98) reduces the value of an agreement in subsequent rounds. In round 1, the discount factor for evaluating offers or potential outcomes is 1 (since gamma^0 = 1). Therefore, my evaluations should be based on the full value of offers without discounting in this first round.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n- **Current Offer**: There is no current offer on the table from Player 2, so I need to propose an initial offer.\n\n- **Potential Counteroffers**: I need to propose a division that keeps my value above my outside offer:\n    - My objective is to maximize my values while making it reasonable for Player 2. A potential offer could be keeping a combination of high-value items for me while offering the less valuable items to Player 2.\n\n#### Example Calculation:\nTo avoid making mistakes and maximize my outcome, I consider the following potential initial offer:\n  - Offer 0 units of item 1 (keep 4)\n  - Offer 0 units of item 3 (keep 4)\n  - Offer 0 units of item 4 (keep 1)\n  - Offer 4 units of item 5 (keep 0, since item 5 is low-value for me)\n\nEvaluation of above counteroffer:\n- Total value to me: \n  - Item 1: 4 units \u00d7 18 = 72\n  - Item 3: 4 units \u00d7 59 = 236\n  - Item 4: 1 unit \u00d7 50 = 50\n  - Item 5: 0 units \u00d7 1 = 0\n  - Total = 72 + 236 + 50 + 0 = 358\n\nSince 358 is significantly higher than my outside offer of 105, this counteroffer is preferable. This also makes good use of my high-valued items and is a strategic way to start the negotiation.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n- **Walk Away**: This is not preferable since I can make offers or negotiations.\n- **Counteroffer**: I will propose [0, 0, 0, 0, 4] to Player 2, keeping high-value items for myself and offering all units of lowest-value item to Player 2.\n\nWith this analysis completed, the action I'll take is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 4]}\n```",

In round 1 any negotiated allocation is multiplied by \u03b3^(r\u20131) = 1.\n\u2022 The current offer (giving me [0,0,0,0,4]) nets me 4\u00b7100 = 400, which is far below 1024.\n\u2022 In a counteroffer I would be choosing how much of the \u201cpie\u201d to leave for Player\u00a01. Since my maximum \u201cpie\u201d is worth 1130 to me, if I want to beat my outside option I must keep at least 1024 in my own value. That means I could only sacrifice at most 106 of my value. Because my item\u2010values (86, 73, 94, 100 for items 1,3,4,5 respectively) come in relatively large \u201cchunks\u201d, any division that gives Player\u00a01 something acceptable enough (likely well above his outside option) would force me to give away more than 106 in value. (For example, even giving just one unit of item\u00a03 \u2013 my \u201ccheapest\u201d good at 73 \u2013 leaves me 1130 \u2013 73 = 1057, barely above 1024; and offering any item of higher cost leaves me even less. Moreover, Player\u00a01\u2019s private values are unknown but his likely reservation is much lower than his full\u2010pie value so he may well demand a share that is not achievable without costing me too much.)\n\u2022 Thus, given that my outside offer is almost as high as getting everything, any counteroffer I might make runs a high risk of not being acceptable to Player\u00a01 while forcing me to give up nearly all of the surplus.\n\u2022 Because I can guarantee 1024 by walking away (and any delay would incur a discount penalty in later rounds), my best action is to WALK.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

I need another configuration. \n\nLet's adjust:\n- Offer Player 2: [2, 2, 0, 1, 2]\n- This means I keep: [3, 1, 3, 1, 2]\n\nRecalculate my value if I keep these:\n- 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93\n- 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 7 = 7\n- 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 35 = 105\n- 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 2 = 2\n- 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 15 = 30\n\nTotal value for me = 93 + 7 + 105 + 2 + 30 = 237\n\nI'm not achieving 287 yet, let's refine it further:\n\nPropose:\n- Offer Player 2: [2, 2, 0, 0, 2]\n- This means I keep: [3, 1, 3, 2, 2]\n\nRecalculate my value if I keep these:\n- 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93\n- 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 7 = 7\n- 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 35 = 105\n- 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 2 = 4\n- 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 15 = 30\n\nTotal value for me = 93 + 7 + 105 + 4 + 30 = 239\n\nFinally, readjust to ensure I'm over my outside offer:\n- Offer Player 2: [2, 1, 0, 0, 2]\n- This means I keep: [3, 2, 3, 2, 2]\n\nRechecking my final proposed distribution:\n- 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93\n- 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 7 = 14\n- 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 35 = 105\n- 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 2 = 4\n- 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 15 = 30\n\nTotal value for me = 93 + 14 + 105 + 4 + 30 = 246\n\nI'm still under 287. Let's reach the target:\n- Offer Player 2: [2, 1, 0, 0, 1]\n- This means I keep: [3, 2, 3, 2, 3]\n\nIn this configuration:\n- 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93\n- 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 7 = 14\n- 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 35 = 105\n- 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 2 = 4\n- 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45\n\nTotal value for me = 93 + 14 + 105 + 4 + 45 = 261\n\nNow, let's ensure non-over cutoff:\nPropose:\n- Offer Player 2: [2, 0, 0, 1, 1]\n- This means I keep: [3, 3, 3, 1, 3]\n\nRevaluated value:\n- 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93\n- 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21\n- 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 35 = 105\n- 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 2 = 2\n- 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45\n\nTotal value for me = 93 + 21 + 105 + 2 + 45 = 266\n\nBefore completing, go with keeping as follows:\n- Offer Player 2: [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n- Thus, keep: [4, 3, 3, 2, 4]\n\nFinally, I realize this is trivial less but pushing stanza over:\nRecalculate my value:\n- 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 31 = 124\n- 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21\n- 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 35 = 105\n- 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 2 = 4\n- 4 units of item 5 = 4 \u00d7 15 = 60\n\nFinal total my value = 124 + 21 + 105 + 4 + 60 = 314\n\nAction based on transition:\n- This value itself succeeds outside offer (314 > 287). Thus, beneficial.\n\nThus my action:\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]}",

In expectation (and with our private values drawn from a wide uniform distribution) a player\u2019s \u201ctotal\u201d is far higher than one unit of item\u202f1. In fact, if Player\u202f1 were to end up with almost all items they would have nearly their full total value. That is, their own initial offer is extremely demanding (giving them [4,3,3,2,4] out of the totals). In a negotiation like this one the responder (Player\u202f2) has little leverage to \u201cimprove\u201d on an offer that already gives them only a modest 22 when any counteroffer must be acceptable to the proposer (Player\u202f1) who is expecting almost everything.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 2, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    72 x 0 + 4 x 1 + 82 x 2 + 74 x 0 + 50 x 0\n    which is 168 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 170. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

It reduces the total value of the negotiation outcome slightly each round, but in round 1 it's negligible.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\nSince there is no current offer, I need to propose an initial division of items. My goal is to ensure that my retained items have a total value greater than my outside offer of 170.\n\nLet's calculate some examples of possible offers I might make to Player 2:\n\n**Example Offer 1**: Give Player 2 as few items as possible initially.\n- I keep all items.\n  \nMy value for keeping everything:\n\\[5 \\times 72 + 2 \\times 4 + 7 \\times 82 + 9 \\times 74 + 7 \\times 50\\]\n\nCalculating this:\n- \\(5 \\times 72 = 360\\)\n- \\(2 \\times 4 = 8\\)\n- \\(7 \\times 82 = 574\\)\n- \\(9 \\times 74 = 666\\)\n- \\(7 \\times 50 = 350\\)\n\nTotal value: 1958\n\n**Example Offer 2**: Give Player 2 some items but ensure my value remains above 170.\n- If I give Player 2: [0, 1, 0, 1, 1], I need to calculate the value I retain.\n\nI keep the rest:\n- Item 1: 5\n- Item 2: 1\n- Item 3: 7\n- Item 4: 8\n- Item 5: 6\n\nCalculating my retained value:\n- \\(5 \\times 72 = 360\\)\n- \\(1 \\times 4 = 4\\)\n- \\(7 \\times 82 = 574\\)\n- \\(8 \\times 74 = 592\\)\n- \\(6 \\times 50 = 300\\)\n\nTotal retained value: 1830\n\nThis is well above my outside offer value.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nGiven the calculations above, I will propose a counteroffer that ensures my retained items have a value comfortably above my outside offer while proposing a fair and realistic initial division to Player 2.\n\n**Counteroffer**: [0, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n\nThis counteroffer maintains a significantly higher value than my outside offer, minimizes risk, and leaves room for negotiation without jeopardizing my position.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 1, 1]}",

In our case:\n\u2003\u2022 We value item\u202f1 very highly (86 per unit) even though the opponent\u2019s typical draw would be about 51.\n\u2003\u2022 We also like item\u202f3 (61 versus an expected ~51).\n\u2003\u2022 By contrast, our values for items 2 (19) and 5 (13) are low, and the opponent\u2014whose values are drawn uniformly\u2014will likely regard these as more valuable.\n\u2003\u2022 Item\u202f4 (41) is a kind of \u201cin\u2010between\u201d item; opponents may value it a bit more on average.\n\n5. With this in mind we want to \u201cclaim\u201d all of the items that matter most to us (items 1 and 3) while ceding the ones on which we are weaker (items 2 and 5). For item\u202f4 we can share \u2013 giving enough so that our opponent\u2019s expected value exceeds what they could get by \u201cwalking away\u201d (their outside option) yet still retaining a generous share for us.\n\n6. A candidate division is then to give Player\u202f1 (our opponent) all of items 2 and 5 and a share of item\u202f4 that yields them an expected value above a likely outside offer. For example, if we offer them these quantities:\n\u2003\u2022 Item\u202f1: 0 units (we keep all 5 units)\n\u2003\u2022 Item\u202f2: 2 units (all of it)\n\u2003\u2022 Item\u202f3: 0 units (we keep all 7 units)\n\u2003\u2022 Item\u202f4: 4 units (giving them a little less than half of 9)\n\u2003\u2022 Item\u202f5: 7 units (all of it)\nThen the remaining (for us) becomes:\n\u2003\u2022 Item\u202f1: 5,\n\u2003\u2022 Item\u202f2: 0,\n\u2003\u2022 Item\u202f3: 7,\n\u2003\u2022 Item\u202f4: 9\u20134 = 5,\n\u2003\u2022 Item\u202f5: 0.\nOur own deal\u2010value is:\n\u20035\u00d786 + 7\u00d761 + 5\u00d741 = 430 + 427 + 205 = 1062,\nwhich is well above our 497 outside offer.\n\n7. Meanwhile, Player\u202f1 receives:\n\u2003\u2022 2 units of item\u202f2,\n\u2003\u2022 4 units of item\u202f4, and\n\u2003\u2022 7 units of item\u202f5.\nEven if we approximate their per\u2010unit value around 51 (the midpoint of 1 and 101), their \u201cexpected\u201d value is roughly\n\u20032\u00d751 + 4\u00d751 + 7\u00d751 = 102 + 204 + 357 = 663,\nwhich would likely be at least as attractive as their outside option.\n\n8. Given that this division improves our outcome dramatically from 73 (from the original offer) and gives our opponent an expected gain that should exceed their BATNA, it is a reasonable counterproposal in round\u00a01.\n\nThus, my action is to make the following counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 0, 4, 7]}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 2, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    72 x 0 + 4 x 1 + 82 x 2 + 74 x 0 + 50 x 0\n    which is 168 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 170. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Player 1\u2019s round\u20111 offer gives you [2, 1, 3, 2, 1] units\u2014which means, if accepted, you would receive:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item1: 2 (value = 2\u00d717 = 34)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item2: 1 (value = 1\u00d735 = 35)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item3: 3 (value = 3\u00d754 = 162)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item4: 2 (value = 2\u00d753 = 106)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item5: 1 (value = 1\u00d765 = 65)\n\u2003\u2003Total value = 34+35+162+106+65 = 402.\n3. Your outside offer is 301 so the current deal of 402 is above that fallback. However, you have room to negotiate for an even higher deal.\n4. When you make a counteroffer, you state what you will give to Player\u202f1; you then receive the remainder. In the current proposal, Player 1 would get the complement: for instance, the offered  [2,1,3,2,1] implies Player 1 keeps [3,2,5,2,1].\n5. To improve your payoff, you want a counteroffer that reduces Player 1\u2019s share slightly (in items where you have a strong interest) and leaves you with more items. Noticing that item 3 is very valuable to you (54 per unit), you aim to get one extra unit from that pile without too much cost to Player\u202f1.\n6. One reasonable counteroffer is to propose that you give Player\u202f1 [2, 2, 4, 2, 1]. Then you would get:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item1: 5\u20132 = 3\u2003(units, value 3\u00d717 = 51),\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item2: 3\u20132 = 1\u2003(units, value 1\u00d735 = 35),\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item3: 8\u20134 = 4\u2003(units, value 4\u00d754 = 216),\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item4: 4\u20132 = 2\u2003(units, value 2\u00d753 = 106),\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item5: 2\u20131 = 1\u2003(units, value 1\u00d765 = 65).\n\u2003\u2003Total value = 51+35+216+106+65 = 473.\n7. Compared to accepting the current offer (value 402), this gives you an extra 71 points of value. Meanwhile, the change for Player 1 is that in two items (item1 and item3) they receive one unit less than in their original offer. Given that both players\u2019 valuations are drawn independently, this slight shift is a reasonable counterproposal at this early stage.\n\nThus, I will make the following counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2,2,4,2,1]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 419. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 483 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 1, 4, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    5 x 2 + 27 x 1 + 90 x 4 + 21 x 1 + 18 x 0\n    which is 418 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 419. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 3, 2, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 2, 4, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 2, 4, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 211. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 951 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 0, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    17 x 1 + 57 x 1 + 80 x 0 + 95 x 0 + 68 x 2\n    which is 210 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 211. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

My goal is to maximize my value, so I should consider offering an outcome better than 211 now rather than delaying for slight adjustments due to the discount.\n\n2) Assess the value of proposals:\n   - There is currently no offer on the table to evaluate.\n   - Consider potential offers:\n     - For a starting point, I should create an offer that gives me more value than my outside offer of 211.\n     - Propose keeping a division that provides me a value just above 211.\n\n3) Let's calculate a reasonable counteroffer:\n   - Example counteroffer to Player 2:\n     - Offer Player 2: [0, 0, 3, 2, 3] (meaning I keep 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 5 units of item 5)\n     - My retained items would be: [1, 2, 3, 1, 5]\n     - My value for this proposal would be:\n       - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 17 = 17\n       - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 57 = 114\n       - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 80 = 240\n       - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 95 = 95\n       - 5 units of item 5 = 5 \u00d7 68 = 340\n     - Total value = 17 + 114 + 240 + 95 + 340 = 806\n\nSince this offer's value to me (806) is well above my outside offer of 211, it is a favorable option in terms of value maximization.\n\nConsidering these points, my action will be to propose this initial offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 3, 2, 3]}",

Since my total possible value is 556, I must secure a deal that gives me at least 467. In effect I must keep a bundle worth at least 467 to me; therefore I can only \u201cconcede\u201d items that in my eyes are worth at most 556\u2013467 = 89 points.\n\nBecause my highest\u2010valued items are item1 (68 per unit) and item3 (45 per unit), I want to keep all of those. Lower\u2013valued items to me (from my perspective, item2 is only 2 per unit and item5 is 10 per unit) make good concessions. I would also consider a small concession of one unit of item4 (worth 26 to me) if that helps make the deal more attractive to Player 1.\n\nThus, one reasonable counteroffer is to offer Player 1 all of item2 (3 units), one unit of item4, and all of item5 (2 units). With this offer, my allocation becomes:\n\u2003\u2022 item1: all 4 units\u2003\u2003(4 \u00d7 68 = 272)\n\u2003\u2022 item3: all 4 units\u2003\u2003(4 \u00d7 45 = 180)\n\u2003\u2022 item4: the remaining 2 units\u2003\u2003(2 \u00d7 26 = 52)\nAdding up, my total value is 272 + 180 + 52 = 504, which is comfortably above my outside option of 467.\n\nPlayer 1\u2019s offered share is [0, 3, 0, 1, 2].

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 3, 3, 3, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    52 x 3 + 37 x 3 + 43 x 3 + 66 x 3 + 85 x 1\n    which is 679 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 680. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 3, 0, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 3, 0, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

Since we are in round 2, if we conclude the negotiation now, the value will be multiplied by gamma^(2-1) = 0.98.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n1. **Value of the Current Offer if Accepted:**\n   - If I accept the current offer [0, 3, 0, 1, 2]: I receive 0 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n   - Total value = (0 * 52) + (3 * 37) + (0 * 43) + (1 * 66) + (2 * 85) = 0 + 111 + 0 + 66 + 170 = 347\n   - Adjusted value with discount = 347 * 0.98 = 340.06\n\n2. **Comparison to Outside Offer:**\n   - The current offer value (340.06) is less than my outside offer value (680).\n\n### Step 3: Decision Making\n\n1. **Should I accept the current offer?**\n   - No, because the adjusted value (340.06) is less than my outside offer (680).\n\n2. **Should I walk away?**\n   - Not immediately, as it's worth considering if a better counteroffer could be made.\n\n3. **Consider a Counteroffer:**\n   - Calculate a distribution where my value is more than 680.\n   - Example offer: [1, 1, 1, 1, 0] for Player 2\n   - My allocation: [3, 2, 3, 2, 2] \n   - My value = (3 * 52) + (2 * 37) + (3 * 43) + (2 * 66) + (2 * 85)\n   - My value = 156 + 74 + 129 + 132 + 170 = 661\n   - Adjusted value with discount (round 2) = 661 * 0.98 = 648.78\n   - Still less than my outside offer.\n\n4. **Optimal Counteroffer:**\n   - Offer [2, 1, 2, 1, 0] to Player 2\n   - My share: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]\n   - My value = (2 * 52) + (2 * 37) + (2 * 43) + (2 * 66) + (2 * 85)\n   - My value = 104 + 74 + 86 + 132 + 170 = 566\n   - Adjusted value = 566 * 0.98 = 554.68\n   - Value still underestimated; iterations needed for better representation.\n\nTo properly decide, we must reach a counteroffer where my discounted value beats 680, keeping in mind balancing vs. opponent. Iterating divisions aiming efficient increments for effective state.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n**Counteroffer chosen (adjusted value method):** [1, 1, 1, 1, 0] for Player 2 \u2013 aims maximizing my self worth within bounds.

Under that division, I would receive the complementary bundle:\n\u2003\u2003For item1: I would get 4 \u2013 0 = 4 units;\n\u2003\u2003For item2: 3 \u2013 3 = 0 units;\n\u2003\u2003For item3: 4 \u2013 0 = 4 units;\n\u2003\u2003For item4: 3 \u2013 1 = 2 units;\n\u2003\u2003For item5: 2 \u2013 2 = 0 units.\nMy raw value then would be:\n\u2003\u2003item1: 4\u00d768 = 272,\n\u2003\u2003item3: 4\u00d745 = 180,\n\u2003\u2003item4: 2\u00d726 = 52,\n\u2003\u2003Total = 272 + 180 + 52 = 504.\nDiscounted in round 2 (multiplied by 0.98) that becomes about 494, which is better than my fallback of 467.\n\n6. Although I do not know Player 1\u2019s private values, offering them the previously proposed bundle [0, 3, 0, 1, 2] (which is valid given the total available amounts) may entice them to agree rather than risk a worse outcome later. It is clearly far superior for me than accepting the very poor current offer.\n\nThus, based on the above reasoning, my best move is to make the counteroffer identical to my previous offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 0, 1, 2]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 680. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 849 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 3, 3, 3, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    52 x 3 + 37 x 3 + 43 x 3 + 66 x 3 + 85 x 1\n    which is 679 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 680. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 3, 0, 1, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [0, 3, 0, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 3, 0, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

Since no beneficial counteroffer exceeds the outside offer at this moment, the logical decision is to propose a division that gets as close as possible to the outside offer (but still keeping it as a secure fallback if necessary in future rounds). Let's attempt a division where I retain: 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 unit of item 4, and 2 unit of item 5. Offer Player 2 [3, 0, 1, 0, 0].\n\n\nHere is the calculation for this potential counteroffer:\n   - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 29 = 58\n   - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 91 = 182\n   - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 91 =182\n   - 2 unit of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 77 = 154\n   - 2 unit of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 54 = 108\n\n   Total value = 58 + 182 + 182 + 154 + 108 = 684\n\n\nGiven that this proposed division provides a value closest to my outside offer while remaining below it, I will make this counteroffer in the first round, hoping for an improved position later on or at least preparation if similar feasible offers arise:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 0, 1, 0, 0]}",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 0, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    11 x 1 + 83 x 1 + 49 x 0 + 5 x 1 + 61 x 1\n    which is 160 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 162. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

This means the value of any offer will reduce by a factor of 0.98 per round.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers\n\n#### Evaluate Scenarios\n\n1. **Keeping All Items**:\n   - Total value = (5 * 11) + (1 * 83) + (0 * 49) + (7 * 5) + (6 * 61)\n   - Total value = 55 + 83 + 0 + 35 + 366 = 539\n\nSince I should make an initial offer that maximizes my benefit while still being above my outside offer, let's experiment with balanced distributions that give a significant portion to Player 2 without me falling below the value of 162.\n\n2. **Potential Offer [3, 0, 0, 4, 3]**: \n   - My share: [2, 1, 0, 3, 3]\n   - Value to me = (2 * 11) + (1 * 83) + (0 * 49) + (3 * 5) + (3 * 61)\n   - Value to me = 22 + 83 + 0 + 15 + 183 = 303\n\nThis value (303) is well above my outside offer of 162, and thus, a viable initial offer to make.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision\n\nGiven the analysis, I will propose the following initial counteroffer to Player 2, which values my portion at 303, satisfying my goal of exceeding my outside offer value:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 0, 0, 4, 3]}\n```",

Let's calculate my value if I accept it:\n\n   - Item 1: 1 unit \u00d7 11 = 11\n   - Item 2: 1 unit \u00d7 83 = 83\n   - Item 3: 0 units \u00d7 49 = 0\n   - Item 4: 3 units \u00d7 5 = 15\n   - Item 5: 3 units \u00d7 61 = 183\n\n   Total value = 11 + 83 + 0 + 15 + 183 = 292\n\n   **Discounted Value in Round 2**:\n   \\(292 \\times 0.98 = 286.16\\)\n\n   This discounted value (286.16) is greater than my outside offer value of 162, hence accepting this offer is better than walking away based on the current offer.\n\n2. **Potential Counteroffers**: To avoid Mistake 2, any counteroffer I propose should have a value to me that is greater than my outside offer of 162. \n\n   Let's calculate the value of keeping the original offer I made in Round 1 for context, to see if it provides higher value:\n\n   My offer in Round 1 was [3, 0, 0, 4, 3], so I'd keep [2, 1, 0, 3, 3]:\n   - Item 1: 2 units \u00d7 11 = 22\n   - Item 2: 1 unit \u00d7 83 = 83\n   - Item 3: 0 units \u00d7 49 = 0\n   - Item 4: 3 units \u00d7 5 = 15\n   - Item 5: 3 units \u00d7 61 = 183\n\n   Total = 22 + 83 + 0 + 15 + 183 = 303\n\n   Applying the discount, my value becomes \\(303 \\times 0.98 = 296.94\\).\n\n   This counteroffer slightly increases my value compared to accepting the current offer but may not be accepted by Player 2 since they didn't accept it in the last round.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nGiven the calculations:\n\n- **Accepting** the current offer yields a discounted value of 286.16, which is much higher than the 162 guarantee from walking away.\n- **Making my previous counteroffer** back could potentially still yield higher value than the current offer but may risk refusal.\n\nThus, accepting the current offer secures a higher guaranteed value and aligns with my objectives, while also mitigating the risk of Player 2 rejecting my next counteroffer and devaluing further rounds due to the discount factor.\n\nHence, my decision is to:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 920. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 920. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 861 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 0, 6, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    47 x 1 + 14 x 1 + 74 x 0 + 98 x 6 + 54 x 5\n    which is 919 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 920. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

                    "response": "To decide on an initial offer to Player 2, let's walk through the analysis step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the current situation\n- **My outside offer value**: 920\n- **Values of the items involved (my values)**:\n  - Item 1: 47\n  - Item 2: 14\n  - Item 3: 74\n  - Item 4: 98\n  - Item 5: 54\n- **Total pool of items**: \n  - 3 units of item 1\n  - 4 units of item 2\n  - 2 units of item 3\n  - 8 units of item 4\n  - 5 units of item 5\n\n- **Discount factor**: This influences the value if waiting for a deal in future rounds. If the negotiation enters additional rounds, the effective value of an outcome is multiplied by \\(\\gamma^{r-1}\\), where \\(r\\) is the round number. Since we're only in round 1, the discount does not apply yet.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the value of offers\n\nSince this is the beginning of the game, there is no current offer from the other player. We need to formulate an initial offer.\n\n#### Evaluating counteroffers\nWe need to create a counteroffer where the value based on my values is greater than my outside offer of 920.\n\n- **Initial offer proposal**: Consider intuitively offering fewer items of high personal value. Let's try maximizing our retention of the high-value item 4.\n\nSuppose I start by proposing:\n- Keep: 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 7 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5\n- Offer to Player 2: 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 1 unit of item 5\n\nCalculation:\n- My retained value:\n  - Item 1: 3 \u00d7 47 = 141\n  - Item 2: 3 \u00d7 14 = 42\n  - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 74 = 148\n  - Item 4: 7 \u00d7 98 = 686\n  - Item 5: 4 \u00d7 54 = 216\n- Total retained value = 141 + 42 + 148 + 686 + 216 = 1233\n\nThis retained offer value of 1233 is greater than my outside offer of 920, making it a reasonable starting offer. \n\n### Step 3: Make a decision\nBased on my analysis above, making this initial offer allows me to keep a total value greater than my outside offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 1, 1]} \n\nThis keeps my retained value well above my fallback option, reduces the chance of making a mistake compared to my outside offer, and it allows for meaningful negotiations with Player 2.",

Thus, accepting the current offer is not good for us.\n4. In making a counteroffer we must propose a division (by stating what we give to Player 1) ensuring:\n\u2003\u2003a. Our \u201cresidual\u201d share (items we keep = total minus items allocated to Player 1) gives us a value at least equal to our outside offer (501) when discounted (here discount factor is 1 in round 1).\n\u2003\u2003b. The offer is \u201cplausible\u201d and potentially acceptable to Player 1 (i.e. it is not extremely one\u2010sided).\n5. One reasonable way is to guarantee our own value while not giving very high\u2010value items away. Notice that our highest\u2010value item is item 1 (79 per unit) so we prefer to keep as many item 1\u2019s as possible; while we are less \u201churt\u201d by giving away lower\u2010value items.\n6. A possible counteroffer: Give Player 1 the following allocation: 1 unit of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5. Check totals:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 For each item, total available = [3,4,2,8,5]. With our proposal, Player 1 gets [1,3,1,3,2] and we would get the remainder: [2,1,1,5,3]. These sums correctly add up.\n7. Our share then is:\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 2\u00d779 = 158\n\u2003\u2003Item 2: 1\u00d712 = 12\n\u2003\u2003Item 3: 1\u00d711 = 11\n\u2003\u2003Item 4: 5\u00d740 = 200\n\u2003\u2003Item 5: 3\u00d759 = 177\n\u2003\u2003Total = 158 + 12 + 11 + 200 + 177 = 558, which is safely above our outside offer of 501.\n8.

Let's try keeping more valuable items:\n\n#### Proposed Counteroffer\nOffer the following to Player 2, and check if I'm keeping enough value:\n- Offer: [0, 0, 0, 2, 3] (giving 0 units of items 1 to 3, 2 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to Player 2)\n\n- **My Units**\n  - Item 1: 3 units\n  - Item 2: 4 units\n  - Item 3: 2 units\n  - Item 4: 6 units\n  - Item 5: 2 units\n\n- **My Total Value**:\n  - Item 1: 3 \u00d7 47 = 141\n  - Item 2: 4 \u00d7 14 = 56\n  - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 74 = 148\n  - Item 4: 6 \u00d7 98 = 588\n  - Item 5: 2 \u00d7 54 = 108\n  - Total value = 141 + 56 + 148 + 588 + 108 = 1,041\n\nSince 1,041 is greater than my outside offer of 920, this proposal is acceptable.\n\nTherefore, my action will be:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 2, 3]}\n```",

Because the deal is concluded in round 2 the outcome is multiplied by gamma^(2\u20131)=0.98. Thus your \u201cpresent\u201d value would be approximately 257\u00d70.98 \u2248 252.\n3. By contrast, your private outside offer is 501, which is available if you WALK away. This guarantee of 501 is far higher than 252.\n4. One might try to counteroffer in order to improve your share. However, in order to get a bundle that delivers you an undiscounted value of at least 501/0.98 \u2248 511 (so that after discount you exceed your outside option), you would have to claim nearly all high\u2010value items (for you items 1 and 5 are especially valuable). But to entice Player\u00a01 to accept such a deal they must receive at least as good a share as they already have in the current proposal \u2013 and from what we know (their offer in round 2 gives them the complementary bundle, which from an expected standpoint is very attractive for them). Given that you do not know their private values and that their current proposal gives them a very high expected value, any counteroffer that would boost your share high enough would leave Player\u00a01 with far less than they already are implicitly offering.\n5. Therefore, accepting the current offer would leave you with a result around 252, and any counteroffer runs the risk that Player\u00a01 will reject it (in which case later rounds\u2019 discounting will leave you with even less). \n6. In comparison, walking away secures the outside offer of 501.\n\nBecause 501 is much more attractive than the current discounted value of the deal and the counteroffer would likely be rejected by a tough Player\u00a01, the best action for you is to WALK.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1064. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 972 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 2, 5, 3, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    16 x 2 + 94 x 2 + 100 x 5 + 90 x 3 + 24 x 3\n    which is 1062 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1064. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Therefore, it's important to reach a favorable outcome quickly if possible.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n- **Current Offer:** There is no current offer on the table to evaluate.\n- **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to assess various potential offers.\n\nLet's calculate the total value of some potential divisions:\n\n1. **Offer where I keep [4, 2, 6, 3, 5] (all items):**\n   - Value: \\(4 \\times 16 + 2 \\times 94 + 6 \\times 100 + 3 \\times 90 + 5 \\times 24 = 64 + 188 + 600 + 270 + 120 = 1242\\)\n   - This is the maximum I can get, but I should offer something to Player 2.\n\n2. **Offer where I keep [3, 1, 4, 2, 3]:**\n   - Value: \\(3 \\times 16 + 1 \\times 94 + 4 \\times 100 + 2 \\times 90 + 3 \\times 24 = 48 + 94 + 400 + 180 + 72 = 794\\)\n   - This value is less than my outside offer, so it's not an acceptable offer.\n\n3. **Offer where I keep [3, 2, 4, 3, 3]:**\n   - Value: \\(3 \\times 16 + 2 \\times 94 + 4 \\times 100 + 3 \\times 90 + 3 \\times 24 = 48 + 188 + 400 + 270 + 72 = 978\\)\n   - Again, less than my outside offer, so this is also not acceptable.\n\n4. **Offer where I keep [3, 2, 5, 3, 3]:**\n   - Value: \\(3 \\times 16 + 2 \\times 94 + 5 \\times 100 + 3 \\times 90 + 3 \\times 24 = 48 + 188 + 500 + 270 + 72 = 1078\\)\n   - This value is slightly above my outside offer, making it an acceptable offer.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\nBased on the analysis, I should propose a counteroffer that gives me a value equal to or higher than my outside offer of 1064.

The totals for all items sum to 810, while our outside option is 639. That means if no deal is reached we\u2019re guaranteed the equivalent of 639 (no discount in round 1); so any deal we agree to must yield us more than 639 in our own evaluation.\n\n2. Player 1\u2019s round\u20111 offer gives us [1, 0, 1, 0, 2] which by our valuation is:\n\u2003\u2003item1: 1\u00d710 = 10,\n\u2003\u2003item2: 0\u00d761 = 0,\n\u2003\u2003item3: 1\u00d714 = 14,\n\u2003\u2003item4: 0\u00d773 = 0,\n\u2003\u2003item5: 2\u00d769 = 138,\n\u2003\u2003Total = 10 + 14 + 138 = 162.\nThis 162 is far below our disagreement outcome of 639 so we must counter.\n\n3. In a counteroffer we choose the division by specifying the number of units we give to Player\u202f1; we get the remainder. Since the full pack is fixed, if we can \u201cclaim\u201d items such that our share\u2019s total value is above 639, we improve over our disagreement outcome.\n\n4. We want a counteroffer that maximizes our gain while still giving Player\u202f1 something of value so that they have an incentive to accept. Because our own high\u2010valued items (items2, 4, and 5) add up high (2\u00d761 + 3\u00d773 + 5\u00d769 = 122 + 219 + 345 = 686), claiming them all would yield 686\u2014only a modest win over 639. However, we may need to \u201cbuy\u201d Player 1\u2019s acceptance by giving them items that we value relatively little (items1 and/or item3). For example, if we give Player\u202f1 all units of item1 (worth 4\u00d710 = 40 to us) and all units of item3 (6\u00d714 = 84 to us), then Player\u202f1 gets [4, \u2013 , 6, \u2013, \u2013] and we keep the rest.\n\n5. Under that division:\n\u2003\u2022 Our allocation becomes: \n\u2003\u2003item1: 0 (4\u20134),\n\u2003\u2003item2: 2 (2\u20130),\n\u2003\u2003item3: 0 (6\u20136),\n\u2003\u2003item4: 3 (3\u20130),\n\u2003\u2003item5: 5 (5\u20130).\n\u2003\u2022 Our total value becomes: 2\u00d761 + 3\u00d773 + 5\u00d769 = 122 + 219 + 345 = 686.\nThis 686 is above our disagreement (639) and leaves Player\u202f1 with items that we value at 40 + 84 = 124 (even though Player\u202f1\u2019s private values are different, they likely would accept an offer that gives them a decent share relative to their outside option).\n\n6. Overall, such a counteroffer leverages our strong outside option by demanding most of the high\u2011value items for ourselves while conceding \u201ccheaper\u201d items to Player\u202f1.\n\nThus, in round 1 the best move is to offer a counterproposal where we give Player\u202f1 all of item1 and item3 and keep items2, 4, and 5.\n\nOur counteroffer in the required format is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 0, 6, 0, 0]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1064. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 972 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 2, 5, 3, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    16 x 2 + 94 x 2 + 100 x 5 + 90 x 3 + 24 x 3\n    which is 1062 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1064. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 1, 0, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [4, 0, 6, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [4, 0, 6, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To make an informed decision, I'll elaborate step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **My outside offer value:** 1064\n- **Values of the items to me:**\n  - Item 1: 16\n  - Item 2: 94\n  - Item 3: 100\n  - Item 4: 90\n  - Item 5: 24\n\n- **Total pool of items:**\n  - Item 1: 4 units\n  - Item 2: 2 units\n  - Item 3: 6 units\n  - Item 4: 3 units\n  - Item 5: 5 units\n\n- **Discount factor influence:** \n  - With a gamma of 0.98, the value of accepting the current offer or waiting for future offers will be discounted slightly with each round. Since it is now round 2, the discount factor is gamma^(2-1) = 0.98^1 = 0.98. \n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current offer on the table (offered to me): [4, 0, 6, 0, 0]**\n  - 4 units of item 1 = 4 x 16 = 64\n  - 0 units of item 2 = 0 x 94 = 0\n  - 6 units of item 3 = 6 x 100 = 600\n  - 0 units of item 4 = 0 x 90 = 0\n  - 0 units of item 5 = 0 x 24 = 0\n  - Total value = 64 + 0 + 600 + 0 + 0 = 664\n  - With the discount = 664 * 0.98 = 650.72\n\n- **Comparison to outside offer:**\n  - My outside offer value is 1064, and the discounted value of accepting the current offer is 650.72. Therefore, the current offer is much worse than my outside offer.\n\n- **Evaluate potential counteroffers:**\n  - To exceed my outside offer value of 1064, I must ensure any proposed item combination offers a value greater than this.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision Based on the Analysis\n\n- **Should I accept the current offer?**\n  - No, as the current offer (650.72 with the discount) is significantly lower than my outside offer (1064).\n\n- **Should I walk away and take my outside offer?**\n  - At this point, walking away guarantees my outside offer value of 1064, which is better than the current offer.\n\n- **Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?**\n  - I need to find a counteroffer where the value of what I keep is greater than or equal to 1064.\n\n   - Let's consider keeping 3 units of item 3 and all of item 4:\n     - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300\n     - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270\n     - I need additional value and aim for higher combined item values for other items.\n   \n   - To surpass 1064, I will choose:\n     - 2 item 1 (2 x 16 = 32)\n     - 2 item 2 (2 x 94 = 188)\n     - 3 item 5 (3 x 24 = 72)\n  - Total value = 32 + 188 + 300 + 270 + 72 = 862\n\n  \n   As this total is insufficient in surpassing 1064 even after attempting various combinations, my guaranteed fallback is better than the potential counteroffers derived.\n\n\nTherefore, my action will be to walk away:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 279. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 897 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 1, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    92 x 1 + 95 x 1 + 74 x 1 + 30 x 0 + 8 x 2\n    which is 277 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 279. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To make an informed decision, let's analyze the situation step-by-step:\n\n1) Current Situation Analysis:\n   - My outside offer value is 279.\n   - My values per unit for the items are as follows:\n     - Item 1: 92\n     - Item 2: 95\n     - Item 3: 74\n     - Item 4: 30\n     - Item 5: 8\n   - Total pool of items: 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 6 units of item 5.\n   - Discount factor (gamma) is 0.98. This reduces the value of future deals compared to immediate deals due to the power (r-1) where r is the round. As we are in round 1, there's no immediate discount impact, but it's relevant for future rounds.\n\n2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n   - There is no current offer on the table that I need to evaluate.\n   - I need to avoid making Mistake 2 (offering something worse for me than my outside offer).\n   - To avoid that mistake, my proposed counteroffer should be worth more than 279 to me.\n\n3) Propose a Counteroffer:\n   - My goal is to keep items with the highest total value for me, ensuring my kept items' value is greater than my outside offer.\n   - Let's propose an offer that maximizes my value while being acceptable:\n     - Offer Player 2: [2, 2, 0, 1, 4] \n     - Keeping for myself: [2, 2, 1, 0, 2] (i.e., I offer Player 2 2 units from item 1, 2 from item 2, 0 from item 3, 1 from item 4, and 4 from item 5).\n\n   Let's calculate the total value to me:\n\n   - Item 1: 2 units \u00d7 92 = 184\n   - Item 2: 2 units \u00d7 95 = 190\n   - Item 3: 1 unit \u00d7 74 = 74\n   - Item 4: 0 units \u00d7 30 = 0\n   - Item 5: 2 units \u00d7 8 = 16\n     \n   Total value = 184 + 190 + 74 + 0 + 16 = 464 \n\nThis is significantly more than my outside offer of 279.\n\nThus, proposing this offer should ensure I avoid Mistake 2 while providing a substantial value.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 0, 1, 4]}",

Under the current division, we receive:\n\u2003\u2022 item 1: 1 unit valued at 35 \u2192 35\n\u2003\u2022 item 2: 0 units valued at 8 \u2192 0\n\u2003\u2022 item 3: 1 unit valued at 53 \u2192 53\n\u2003\u2022 item 4: 0 units valued at 37 \u2192 0\n\u2003\u2022 item 5: 2 units valued at 17 \u2192 34\n\u2003Total = 35 + 53 + 34 = 122.\n\n2. Our outside option is 70. Even before any discount is applied (and in round 1 there is no discount yet), 122 is significantly higher than 70.\n\n3. Considering that making a counteroffer means entering later rounds (with a discount factor \u03b3 = 0.98 per extra round) and introducing the risk that Player 1 might not accept, the potential gain from \u201cbargaining\u201d further has to be weighed against both time discount and risk of losing the deal.\n\n4. Although we might be tempted to revise the division to claim more of the high\u2010value item (especially item 3, for which we would like to receive both units rather than just one), such a counteroffer might force Player 1 to hold out or counter, and the negotiation might extend into later rounds. That extension would discount our outcome and could risk ending with the outside option of 70 if things break down.\n\n5. Given the relatively high immediate utility (122) compared to our outside option (70) and knowing that discounting or protracted bargaining is expensive when the discount factor is less than 1, it is a safe and rational decision in round 1 to accept the current offer rather than risk delaying the agreement.\n\nTherefore, I will choose to ACCEPT the current offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 532. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 532. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 915 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 3, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    15 x 0 + 71 x 0 + 92 x 1 + 98 x 3 + 29 x 5\n    which is 531 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 532. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

If the negotiation concludes in later rounds, the value of the outcome for both players will be multiplied by this discount factor raised to the power of (r-1), where r is the round number. Thus, delaying agreement reduces the effective value of any proposed division due to discounting.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - **For the current offer (if any):** There is no current offer from Player 2.\n   \n   - **For potential counteroffers:** I need to calculate a potential division where my value of the items I keep is greater than 532, my outside offer value.\n   \n     Let's calculate a potential offer by keeping more of the higher value items:\n     - If I keep: [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] and offer [4, 2, 2, 2, 5] to Player 2\n     - My Value Calculation:  \n       - 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 15 = 0  \n       - 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 71 = 0  \n       - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 92 = 92  \n       - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 98 = 196  \n       - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 29 = 29  \n     - Total value = 317\n\n     This offer is less than my outside offer value of 532, so I should attempt a new division.\n\n     Let's modify the strategy:\n     - If I keep: [0, 0, 2, 3, 2] and offer [4, 2, 1, 1, 4] to Player 2\n     - My Value Calculation:  \n       - 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 15 = 0  \n       - 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 71 = 0  \n       - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 92 = 184  \n       - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294  \n       - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 29 = 58  \n     - Total value = 536\n\n     This configuration gives me a total value greater than my outside offer of 532.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - Since there is no current offer from Player 2, and my calculated counteroffer is better for me than my outside offer, I will propose this as an initial offer.\n\nTherefore, based on the analysis, my action would be to provide a counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 2, 1, 1, 4]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 3, 3, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    86 x 0 + 62 x 3 + 8 x 3 + 81 x 3 + 70 x 4\n    which is 733 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 736. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

(Recall that when I make a counteroffer I specify the number of each item I\u2019d \u201cgive\u201d to Player\u00a01 and then I\u2019d receive the rest.) Because my values are quite skewed and there are only 18 total \u201cunits\u201d (1+5+4+4+4) to split, any division that lets me \u201ckeep\u201d items giving me a value above 573 forces me to give away only very little to Player\u00a01\u2014in many cases far less than what he already would have gotten in his own offer ([0, 1, 4, 0, 1] in which he would then receive the complement [1, 4, 0, 4, 3]). In almost every reasonable counteroffer I can \u201cdream up\u201d the size of my share would be high (sometimes above 600 in my value) but only at the expense of giving Player\u00a01 a much smaller allocation than his fallback values might be (and his outside option is unknown but on average expected to be roughly half his potential total of \u2248918). In other words, any counteroffer that would improve my share over the current 323 risks being rejected because it \u201cstarves\u201d him too much relative to his likely fallback.\n\u2003\nGiven that my outside option is a guaranteed 573 (and getting a deal later will also be discounted slightly by \u03b3 = 0.98 for later rounds), accepting 323 now is clearly not in my interest and trying to engineer a counteroffer that leaves him enough \u2013 while still netting me more than 573 \u2013 is very risky.\n\nTherefore, in round 1 it is safest for me to WALK away and get my outside offer of 573 rather than risk a drawn\u2010out negotiation where my \u201ccounteroffer\u201d may be rejected and we end up with a discounted deal.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 962. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 962. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 888 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 5, 6, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    86 x 0 + 78 x 3 + 58 x 5 + 72 x 6 + 2 x 2\n    which is 960 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 962. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

After several attempts for counteroffer, find one that maximizes value above the outside offer.\n\nFinally, I decide:\n- Keep 3 of item 1: 3 \u00d7 86 = 258\n- Keep 3 of item 2: 3 \u00d7 78 = 234\n- Keep 5 of item 3: 5 \u00d7 58 = 290\n- Keep 3 of item 4: 3 \u00d7 72 = 216\n- Keep 0 items from others\n\nFinal total value: 258 + 234 + 290 + 216 + 0 = 998, which is decent and above outside offer.\n\n### 3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n- **Propose a counteroffer**, as none available yet in negotiations and better than the 962 outside value possibility.\n\n**Counteroffer Proposal:**\n- **Offer to Player 2**:\n  - 0 units of item 1\n  - 0 units of item 2\n  - 0 units of item 3\n  - 3 units of item 4\n  - 3 units of item 5\n\nTherefore:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 3, 3]}\n```",

(In gross terms I\u2019d need at least about 550/0.98 \u2248 561.)\n\u2022 Since my total possible gross value from all items is 610, the surplus I can \u201csacrifice\u201d to Player\u00a01 is at most 610 \u2013 561 \u2248 49 points.

Since item1 and item4 are relatively \u201ccheap\u201d for me (13 and 14 per unit) I can use these to concede a small \u201ccost.\u201d\n\u2022 For instance, conceding 2 units of item1 (2\u00d713 = 26) and 1 unit of item4 (1\u00d714 = 14) costs me 26 + 14 = 40.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 5, 6, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    86 x 0 + 78 x 3 + 58 x 5 + 72 x 6 + 2 x 2\n    which is 960 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 962. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Each round reduces the effective value of the items by multiplying it with the discount factor raised to the power of (round - 1). \n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Since there's no current offer, I'll assess potential offers.\n   - I must ensure any counteroffer I make gives me a value greater than my outside offer of 27.\n\n3) Make a decision:\n   - Propose an initial offer that maximizes my value while also being fair to Player 2.\n   - Make sure the offer does not fall into the previously mentioned mistakes.\n\nLet's propose an offer that gives value to Player 2 while making sure my retained units offer greater value than my outside offer. I'll calculate the values of retaining different amounts of items to ensure I get more than 27.\n\nHere's an offer calculation:\n- Retain: [3, 1, 1, 2, 1] (so offer [1, 1, 2, 1, 1] to Player 2)\n  - Value to me: \n    - Item 1: 3 x 49 = 147\n    - Item 2: 1 x 46 = 46\n    - Item 3: 1 x 8 = 8\n    - Item 4: 2 x 72 = 144\n    - Item 5: 1 x 45 = 45\n  - Total retained value = 147 + 46 + 8 + 144 + 45 = 390\n\n390 is well above my outside offer of 27. This proposed division seems strategically sound and maximizes my value while still giving Player 2 a fair share.\n\nThus, my action is to make the following offer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 2, 1, 1]}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 3, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    67 x 0 + 76 x 0 + 72 x 1 + 6 x 3 + 93 x 0\n    which is 90 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 93. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

As rounds progress, the value will be adjusted by gamma (0.98).\n  \n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n\n- **Current Offer (if any):** There is no current offer on the table.\n  \n- **Potential Counteroffers:**\n\n  To ensure I maximize my value while not making any mistakes mentioned, I need to propose a division where my value is higher than or equal to my outside offer of 93. Let's try a few allocations to see what works:\n\n1. **Offer 1:** Offer Player 2 some items and calculate the value for myself:\n   - Offer Player 2: [2, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n     - My remaining items: [2, 3, 3, 3, 2]\n     - My value: \n       - 2 units of item 1 \u00d7 67 = 134\n       - 3 units of item 2 \u00d7 76 = 228\n       - 3 units of item 3 \u00d7 72 = 216\n       - 3 units of item 4 \u00d7 6 = 18\n       - 2 units of item 5 \u00d7 93 = 186\n     - Total value: 134 + 228 + 216 + 18 + 186 = 782\n\nThe total value of keeping [2, 3, 3, 3, 2] (offering [2, 0, 1, 0, 0] to Player 2) is 782, which is considerably higher than my outside offer of 93 and avoids the mistake of offering less than what's beneficial to me.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision Based on Analysis:\n\nGiven my calculations, I should propose a counteroffer where I retain a strong value over my outside offer. The offer [2, 0, 1, 0, 0] is substantially above my outside offer while being a reasonable division of the items, thus aligning with my negotiation objectives.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 1, 0, 0]}\n```",

                    "prompt": "\n    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\n    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\n    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\n    There are 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\n    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\n    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 101.\n    Your private values are 67 for item 1, 76 for item 2, 72 for item 3, 6 for item 4, 93 for item 5.\n    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to your total value of all items, which is 988. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 93. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 93. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 942 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 3, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    67 x 0 + 76 x 0 + 72 x 1 + 6 x 3 + 93 x 0\n    which is 90 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 93. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 1, 2, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 2, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To make an informed decision about whether to accept the current offer, walk away, or propose a counteroffer, let's systematically analyze the situation step by step.\n\n### 1) Current Situation Analysis:\n- **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer is worth 93.\n- **Values of Items:** \n  - Item 1: 67 per unit\n  - Item 2: 76 per unit\n  - Item 3: 72 per unit\n  - Item 4: 6 per unit\n  - Item 5: 93 per unit\n- **Total Pool of Items:**\n  - Item 1: 4 units\n  - Item 2: 3 units\n  - Item 3: 4 units\n  - Item 4: 3 units\n  - Item 5: 2 units\n- **Discount Factor Influence:** In round 2, the overall value of the negotiation to each player is multiplied by \\( \\gamma^{(r-1)} \\), which equals \\( 0.98^{1} = 0.98 \\).\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n- **Current Offer Value to Me:**\n  - I would receive 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n  - My total value for this would be:\n    - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 67 = 134\n    - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 76 = 76\n    - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 72 = 144\n    - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 6 = 6\n    - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 93 = 93\n  - Total value before discount = 134 + 76 + 144 + 6 + 93 = 453\n  - Discounted value = 453 \u00d7 0.98 = 443.94\n\n- **Comparison with Outside Offer:**\n  - My discounted value from the current offer (443.94) is much higher than my outside offer (93).\n\nGiven that the current offer yields a value that is significantly higher than my outside offer, accepting it ensures I secure a solid outcome. Proceeding to additional rounds introduces uncertainty and potential reduced values due to the discount factor, which favors accepting the present advantageous offer.\n\n### 3) Decision:\nBased on the above analysis, the current offer is substantially better than my outside offer. Therefore, I should accept it.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",
