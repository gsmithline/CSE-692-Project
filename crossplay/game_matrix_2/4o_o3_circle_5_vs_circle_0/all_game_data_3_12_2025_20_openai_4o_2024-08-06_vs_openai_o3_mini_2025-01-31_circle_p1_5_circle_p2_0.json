Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 500. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 500. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 663 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 3, 4, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    21 x 0 + 7 x 1 + 32 x 3 + 99 x 4 + 62 x 0\n    which is 499 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 500. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

However, since this is round 1, we don't have to apply the discount factor yet, but we should be mindful of it for future rounds.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n\n   - There is no current offer from Player 2 on the table.\n   - We need to determine a counteroffer that provides a value greater than my outside offer of 500.\n\n   Let's calculate the value for various potential allocations:\n\n   - Hypothetical offer: Allocate most valuable items to myself:\n     - Keep 2 of item 1 (value = 2 * 21 = 42)\n     - Keep 5 of item 2 (value = 5 * 7 = 35)\n     - Keep 5 of item 3 (value = 5 * 32 = 160)\n     - Keep 5 of item 4 (value = 5 * 99 = 495)\n     - Keep 2 of item 5 (value = 2 * 62 = 124)\n     - Total value = 42 + 35 + 160 + 495 + 124 = 856\n\n   By keeping all or most valuable items, I achieve a value of 856, which is well above my outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a Decision Based on the Analysis:**\n\n   Since I have no offers on the table yet, I need to propose an initial offer that maximizes my value over my outside offer but is not overly aggressive to encourage negotiations.\n\n   To avoid mistakes:\n   - I won't make an offer worse than my outside offer.\n   - I won't offer all or no items.\n   - I aim to keep the highest-value items (like all of item 4) for myself to maximize my outcome.\n\n   Let's propose a counteroffer that gives Player 2 some value but keeps the most valuable item for myself:\n\n   - Give 0 of item 1\n   - Give 2 of item 2\n   - Give 3 of item 3\n   - Give 0 of item 4 (keep all item 4)\n   - Give 3 of item 5\n   \n   Let's calculate my value using this offer:\n\n   - My kept allocation: [2, 3, 2, 5, 2]\n     - 42 + 21 + 64 + 495 + 124 = 746\n\nThis offer provides significant value to me (746), well above my outside offer, while still giving Player 2 some items. \n\nTherefore, my action is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 3, 0, 3]}\n```",

                    "response": "Step\u2010by\u2010step reasoning:\n\n1. Our valuation for each unit is: item\u202f1: 22, item\u202f2: 4, item\u202f3: 91, item\u202f4: 31, and item\u202f5: 88. In total, if we got everything we\u2019d receive 807 in value.\n2. The current offer on the table gives us [2, 0, 0, 0, 4]. That means we would receive:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item\u202f1: 2\u00d722 = 44\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item\u202f5: 4\u00d788 = 352\n\u2003\u2003totaling 44+352 = 396.\n3. In addition we have an outside option (or \u201creservation\u201d) of 685. Thus accepting 396 is far below our guaranteed value.\n4. In trying to craft a counteroffer the idea would be to propose a division of the items \u2013 that is, deciding which items we keep and which we offer to Player\u202f1. In our situation we must \u201cgive up\u201d items so that our own share is at least 685. For example, if we tried to keep only our \u201cbest\u2010items\u201d (item\u202f3 and item\u202f5) we would keep 4 units of item\u202f3 and 4 units of item\u202f5 giving us 4\u00d791 + 4\u00d788 = 364+352 = 716. That would leave Player\u202f1 with item\u202f1 (2 units), item\u202f2 (4 units) and item\u202f4 (1 unit) for an aggregate value (by our numbers) of 2\u00d722 + 4\u00d74 + 1\u00d731 = 44+16+31 = 91. \n5. However, note that Player\u202f1\u2019s valuation is private and drawn uniformly from 1 to 101; so while our \u201cexpected\u201d value for any unit is roughly 51 on average, the counteroffer we make must compete with what Player\u202f1 might eventually get. In the current negotiation, Player 1\u2019s original offer to us, if accepted, would give Player\u202f1 the complementary bundle:\n\u2003\u2003[0, 4, 4, 1, 0].\n\u2003\u2003By our (expected) rough calculation, this complementary share is worth on the order of 4\u00d751+4\u00d751+1\u00d751 = 459 (approximately) to them.\n6. To induce Player\u202f1 to accept a counteroffer, we would have to concede enough items so that they would get at least around 459 in expected value. But doing so while keeping enough for ourselves (at least 685) is impossible. For example, if we add further concessions (say conceding some of our high\u2010value item5 units) we would lose more than the available \u201cslack\u201d of 807 \u2013 685 = 122 points.\n7. Thus, no counteroffer would simultaneously give us at least 685 in our own value while providing Player\u202f1 with roughly what they expect (or more) from their own offer.\n8. Consequently, compared to any negotiated division, walking away gives us a guaranteed 685. That is preferable and leaves us no incentive to lower our own guaranteed value by entering into an agreement below our outside option.\n\nGiven this reasoning, my best action is to WALK away.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    67 x 0 + 20 x 0 + 91 x 0 + 2 x 1 + 63 x 1\n    which is 65 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 67. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Currently, accepting Player\u00a01\u2019s offer would get me:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 0 (out of 2)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 8 (out of 8)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 0 (out of 3)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 2 (out of 2)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 0 (out of 1)\n\u2003\u2003For a total value of 0\u00d763 + 8\u00d765 + 0\u00d734 + 2\u00d746 + 0\u00d79 = 520 + 92 = 612.\n\n2. My private outside option is 664 (and I\u2019d get that if I walk away). So 612 is below my fallback.\n\n3. I want to improve my share so that my deal\u2019s value (without discount this round) is at least 664. Since my overall \u201cpie\u201d (all items) is worth 849 to me, I must keep at least 849 \u2013 664 = 185 \u201cvalue\u2010points\u201d worth of items. In other words, I can concede at most 185 (in my valuation) to Player\u00a01.\n\n4. Among the items, I value item 1 very highly (63 per unit); whereas I value item 3 (34 per unit) and especially item 5 (9 per unit) relatively low. In the current deal, I\u2019m not getting any of item 1 even though all 2 units are going to Player\u00a01. So one natural improvement is to \u201csteal\u201d one unit of item\u00a01. That would boost my value by 63 to get from 612 to 675 (which is above my outside offer). \n\n5. Concretely, if I aim for a deal that gives me:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 2 \u2013 1 = 1 unit (I \u201csteal\u201d 1 unit from Player\u00a01)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Items 2 and 4: I still get them in full (8 and 2, respectively)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Items 3 and 5: I leave them as in the current offer (i.e. all of item\u00a03 and item\u00a05 go to Player\u00a01)\n\u2003then my final allocation becomes: [1, 8, 0, 2, 0] with a total value of 1\u00d763 + 8\u00d765 + 0\u00d734 + 2\u00d746 + 0\u00d79 = 63 + 520 + 92 = 675.\n\u2003\u2003Player\u00a01 would then receive [1, 0, 3, 0, 1] (since totals are [2,8,3,2,1]). \n\n6. From my view, the \u201cconcession\u201d (the difference from full pie 849) is 849 \u2013 675 = 174 (which is within the maximum I can concede of 185). Although Player\u00a01 is now losing 1 unit of item 1 relative to their original offer, this slight shift might be acceptable given the risk of further delays (and our outside offers looming).\n\n7. Therefore, my counteroffer is to propose giving Player\u00a01 the bundle [1, 0, 3, 0, 1] so that I get [1,8,0,2,0] for a value of 675 \u2013 better than my outside offer.\n\nBased on this reasoning, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 3, 0, 1]}",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    67 x 0 + 20 x 0 + 91 x 0 + 2 x 1 + 63 x 1\n    which is 65 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 67. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 8, 0, 2, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 3, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 3, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

With your private values (item 1=11, item 2=65, item 3=55, item 4=44, item 5=11), the value you get if you accept is\n\u2003\u2003= 1\u00d711 + 2\u00d765 + 2\u00d755 + 2\u00d744 + 2\u00d711\n\u2003\u2003= 11 + 130 + 110 + 88 + 22\n\u2003\u2003= 361.\n\nStep 2: Compare with your outside offer. Your private outside offer is 582. Since 361 < 582, accepting the current offer would leave you with less than what you can secure by simply walking away.\n\nStep 3: Consider counteroffers. As Player 2 you can make a counteroffer. In doing so you would try to re-divide the items so that your share\u2019s value (discounted by \u03b3^(r-1); here discounting is 1 in Round 1) is more than what you\u2019d get by accepting the current offer. However, because your reservation value (582) is already significantly higher than 361 and because any delay risks discounting future deals, you would have to \u201cbuy\u201d your surplus from Player 1 by offering them items of relatively low value to you while still obtaining nearly 582 in total value. A preliminary calculation shows that if you try to carve out a deal that gives you exactly 582, you would be forced to offer Player 1 items whose total \u201ccost\u201d to you amounts to 713 \u2013 582 = 131 in value. For example, a candidate counteroffer might be to give Player 1 one unit of item2 (value 65), one unit of item4 (value 44), one unit of item1 (value 11), and one unit of item5 (value 11) since 65 + 44 + 11 + 11 = 131. That would leave you with the remainder: item1:5, item2:1, item3:4, item4:5, item5:2\u2014exactly totaling 582 under your values. \n\nStep 4: Evaluate acceptance chances for such a counteroffer. However, note that Player 1\u2019s own private values are drawn uniformly from 1 to 101. Their outside offer (their reservation) is drawn from a range up to their total value. Their expected \u201creservation\u201d might be fairly high (in line with roughly half of what their total could be), which makes it unlikely that an offer that leaves them with items worth roughly 131 (in your value terms) would be acceptable to them. The current offer already allocated a relatively larger amount of items (and hence value) to themselves. \n\nStep 5: Decide on the best action. Because the current offer only gives you 361 (well below your outside offer of 582) and any counteroffer you design to try to improve your own value risks rejection (which leads, with discounting and the structure of the game, to even lower present values), your best guarantee is to immediately secure your outside offer. \n\nThus, the optimal immediate move is to WALK away.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 139. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 906 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 0, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    25 x 2 + 32 x 0 + 62 x 0 + 96 x 0 + 87 x 1\n    which is 137 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 139. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Let's go through this step by step:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n   - **Outside offer value:** My private outside offer value is 139.\n   - **Values of the items involved:**\n     - Item 1: 25 per unit\n     - Item 2: 32 per unit\n     - Item 3: 62 per unit\n     - Item 4: 96 per unit\n     - Item 5: 87 per unit\n   - **Total pool of items:**\n     - 4 units of item 1\n     - 2 units of item 2\n     - 1 unit of item 3\n     - 6 units of item 4\n     - 3 units of item 5\n   - **Discount factor influence:** In the first round, the discount factor doesn't affect the value of the current offer, but in rounds 2 and 3, it will reduce the effective value of any accepted outcome due to being multiplied by gamma (0.98) raised to the power of (r-1).\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   \n   - **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** I will explore various divisions to ensure I retain a value higher than my outside offer of 139.\n\n     Let's calculate a few potential scenarios:\n\n     1. I keep [4, 2, 1, 1, 1] items:\n        - Total value = (4 * 25) + (2 * 32) + (1 * 62) + (1 * 96) + (1 * 87) = 100 + 64 + 62 + 96 + 87 = 409 (better than the outside offer)\n        \n     2. I keep [4, 1, 0, 2, 3] items:\n        - Total value = (4 * 25) + (1 * 32) + (0 * 62) + (2 * 96) + (3 * 87) = 100 + 32 + 0 + 192 + 261 = 585 (better than the outside offer)\n\n     3. I keep [2, 1, 0, 3, 2] items:\n        - Total value = (2 * 25) + (1 * 32) + (0 * 62) + (3 * 96) + (2 * 87) = 50 + 32 + 0 + 288 + 174 = 544 (better than the outside offer)\n\n    From these calculations, all options lead to values higher than my outside offer, so I should propose a counteroffer like these without risking a mistake.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on analysis:**\n\n   Since there is no current offer to accept, and I want to make sure I propose an offer that gives me more value than my outside offer, I will go with a counteroffer that keeps a high item value for me and gives the rest to Player 2. I'm choosing the scenario where I keep [4, 1, 0, 2, 3] items for maximum benefit while ensuring Player 2 still receives some of the items.  \n\n   My counteroffer for Player 2: [0, 1, 1, 4, 0] items.

It affects the net gain in value by slightly reducing the total value by 2% per round delay. Since it\u2019s round 1, there\u2019s no immediate need to hurry, but making a constructive opening offer should be considered to avoid a protracted negotiation.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Potential Offers\n\nCurrently, there is no offer on the table, so I need to propose an initial offer:\n\n- **My total value if I kept all items** would be:\n\n  - \\(6 \\times 93 + 6 \\times 88 + 6 \\times 10 + 1 \\times 83 + 3 \\times 61 = 558 + 528 + 60 + 83 + 183 = 1412\\).\n\n  This is my maximum conceivable value.\n\n- **Evaluate possible initial offers:**\n\n  To ensure I don\u2019t make mistakes 2 (offering less than my outside offer value) and 3 (offering all/no items), I should propose an offer that keeps at least a meaningful part of the total value.\n\n  Let me calculate a potential division where my value from retained items is above the outside offer of 619:\n\n  If I keep: \n  - 3 units of item 1,\n  - 2 units of item 2,\n  - 0 units of item 3 (least valuable to me),\n  - 1 unit of item 4,\n  - 0 units of item 5,\n\n  The value to me would be:\n\n  \\((3 \\times 93) + (2 \\times 88) + (0 \\times 10) + (1 \\times 83) + (0 \\times 61) = 279 + 176 + 0 + 83 + 0 = 538\\).\n\n  I need to revise because this is still below my outside offer of 619. Let's adjust:\n\n  If I modify it to:\n  - 3 units of item 1,\n  - 3 units of item 2,\n  - 0 units of item 3 (least valuable to me),\n  - 0 units of item 4,\n  - 2 units of item 5,\n\n  The value would be:\n  \n  \\((3 \\times 93) + (3 \\times 88) + (0 \\times 10) + (0 \\times 83) + (2 \\times 61) = 279 + 264 + 0 + 0 + 122 = 665\\).\n\n  This is safely above my outside offer.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nI have determined a division where my value is 665, which is above my fallback position of 619. To maximize my outcome, I will offer the remainder:\n\nThis would mean I\u2019m keeping:\n- 3 Item 1\n- 3 Item 2\n- 0 Item 3\n- 0 Item 4\n- 2 Item 5\n\nAnd giving away:\n- 3 Item 1\n- 3 Item 2\n- 6 Item 3\n- 1 Item 4\n- 1 Item 5\n\nThis ensures I'm not inadvertently giving away more value than my outside offer, adhering to the strategic guidance.\n\n**Thus, I propose the following counteroffer:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 3, 6, 1, 1]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 4, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    6 x 0 + 100 x 0 + 39 x 0 + 1 x 4 + 37 x 5\n    which is 189 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 190. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

However, it impacts future rounds.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n- **Current Offer Value (if any)**: There is no current offer on the table.\n- **Potential Counteroffers**:\n  - To ensure a better offer than my outside value (1142), I need to first calculate a division that yields a higher value for myself. An example can look like this:\n  - Keeping:\n    - 2 units of Item 1\n    - 1 unit of Item 2\n    - 5 units of Item 3\n    - 1 unit of Item 4\n    - 3 units of Item 5\n- **Calculating My Value for the Above Division**:\n  \\[\n  2 \\times 91 + 1 \\times 17 + 5 \\times 83 + 1 \\times 60 + 3 \\times 58 = 182 + 17 + 415 + 60 + 174 = 848\n  \\]\n- **Comparing to Outside Offer**:\n  - 848 is significantly less than 1142, so I need to propose an alternative division.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision Based on Analysis:\nGiven the calculations:\n- It's clear that keeping a considerable number of high-value Item 3 is crucial to getting close to or exceeding my outside offer.\n  \nTo optimize my retained value, attempt a more favorable division that might involve giving up less low-value items or fewer high-value units to maximize my retained value above 1142:\n\n- **Proposal**:\n  - Offer to Player 2:\n    - 0 units of Item 1\n    - 0 units of Item 2\n    - 1 unit of Item 3\n    - 0 units of Item 4\n    - 6 units of Item 5\n\nCalculating these, I retain:\n- 2 \\times 91 + 2 \\times 17 + 4 \\times 83 + 2 \\times 60 + 2 \\times 58 = 182 + 34 + 332 + 120 + 116 = 784 (this value is still less than 1142).\n\nThis scenario reveals a significant challenge in division. Consider a best practical scenario that keeps value maximized:\n\n- Offer to Player 2:\n  - 0 units of Item 1\n  - 1 unit of Item 2\n  - 0 units of Item 3\n  - 0 units of Item 4\n  - 5 units of Item 5\n\nCalculating my value now:\n\n\\[\n2 \\times 91 + 1 \\times 17 + 5 \\times 83 + 2 \\times 60 + 3 \\times 58 = 182 + 17 + 415 + 120 + 174 = 908\n\\]\n\nThis is still below 1142, which forces a re-evaluation.\n\nDue to the challenge in reallocation, adjust offering Player 2 more units of lower value items first or maintain a split near thresholds where Item 3 allocations are pivotal to offset outside considerations.\n\nUltimately:\n\n### Best Offer to Counter:\nAfter examining again, let's ensure retention of critical mass to challenge outside offers correctly:\n\n- Example offer division:\n  - Offer to Player 2:\n    - 0 units of Item 1\n    - 1 unit of Item 2\n    - 0 units of Item 3\n    - 0 units of Item 4\n    - 5 units of Item 5\n\nBy structuring an earlier attempt what maintains closer proximity in offering competitive adjustment while optimizing retainment further would release pressure on evaluations initially leading a robust proposition step.\n\nWith these dynamics studied where parity risks alignment, complete recalibration wasn't leading successful dynamics if minimal alternative focus shown in current challenged gaps persisted.\n\nGiven the complex retreat dynamic - sustaining aggression yield optimal credence due to potential parallel adverse:\n\nContinue proposing reassessments paused upon earlier unqualified ignitions basis primarily concerned lack heights if maintained.\n\nThus upon evaluation:\n\nASSESS ```{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 0, 5]}``` remains feasible dilated interplay exchange based extrapolative yielding story.\n\n",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 1, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    36 x 0 + 17 x 1 + 35 x 1 + 47 x 0 + 40 x 1\n    which is 92 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 93. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Thus, immediate agreements are more valuable than delayed ones.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\nSince it's the first round and there is no offer from Player 2 yet, I need to calculate the potential value of various counteroffers I might make:\n\n1. Start by estimating potential divisions of items that would give me a higher value than my outside offer (93):\n\n   - **Consider keeping most valuable items**:\n     - Offers that provide me with more valuable items should be prioritized.\n\n2. For example, if I propose the following to Player 2:\n\n   - Offer: [2, 3, 1, 1, 3] \u2013 This means giving Player 2:\n     - 2 units of item 1\n     - 3 units of item 2\n     - 1 unit of item 3\n     - 1 unit of item 4\n     - 3 units of item 5\n\n   - I would keep:\n     - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 36 = 72\n     - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51\n     - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 35 = 70\n     - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 47 = 47\n     - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 40 = 80\n\n   - My total value = 72 + 51 + 70 + 47 + 80 = 320\n\nSince this potential offer gives me a value of 320, which is much higher than my outside offer of 93, it's a strong starting point for the negotiation.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nGiven the analysis, my action will be to propose a counteroffer that maximizes my value while considering fairness. \n\nI'm offering Player 2 a division of:\n\n- 2 units of item 1,\n- 3 units of item 2,\n- 1 unit of item 3,\n- 1 unit of item 4,\n- 3 units of item 5.\n\nThis counteroffer is reasonable, ensuring a significant personal value gain and leaving Player 2 with a fair amount of items.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 3, 1, 1, 3]}\n```",

Our value for the remainder (what we \u201ckeep\u201d) is computed as follows:\n\n\u2003\u2003Value(P2) = 22\u00d7(4 \u2013 a) + 65\u00d7(6 \u2013 b) + 91\u00d7(3 \u2013 c) + 98\u00d7(2 \u2013 d) + 91\u00d7(5 \u2013 e)\n\nwhere [a, b, c, d, e] is our offer (the number of units of each item offered to Player 1).\n\nWe want our share to be about 882. An allocation that satisfies\n\n\u2003\u200322\u00d7(4 \u2013 a) + 65\u00d7(6 \u2013 b) + 91\u00d7(3 \u2013 c) + 98\u00d7(2 \u2013 d) + 91\u00d7(5 \u2013 e) = 882\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u21d4 22a + 65b + 91c + 98d + 91e = 1402 \u2013 882 = 520\n\nis what we target.\n\nSince our low\u2010value items for us are item 1 (22 per unit) and item 2 (65 per unit) we prefer to give most or all of them to Player 1, while keeping as much as possible of the higher\u2013value items (items 3, 4 and 5). One solution is as follows:\n\n\u2022 Let a = 0 (so we keep all 4 units of item 1).\n\u2022 Let b = 1 (so Player 1 gets 1 unit of item 2 and we keep 5 units).\n\u2022 Let c = 1 (so Player 1 gets 1 unit of item 3 and we keep 2 units).\n\u2022 Let d = 0 (Player 1 gets 0 units of item 4 so we keep all 2 units).\n\u2022 Let e = 4 (so Player 1 gets 4 units of item 5 and we keep 1 unit).\n\nNow, verify our \u201closs\u201d in our value:\n\u2003\u2003From item 1: 0\u00d722 = 0\n\u2003\u2003From item 2: 1\u00d765 = 65\n\u2003\u2003From item 3: 1\u00d791 = 91\n\u2003\u2003From item 4: 0\u00d798 = 0\n\u2003\u2003From item 5: 4\u00d791 = 364\n\nSum = 65 + 91 + 364 = 520\n\nThat is exactly the \u201closs\u201d from the full 1402 that gives us a kept value of 1402 \u2013 520 = 882.\n\nAnd our allocation (what we keep) is:\n\u2003\u2003item 1: 4 \u2013 0 = 4 units\n\u2003\u2003item 2: 6 \u2013 1 = 5 units\n\u2003\u2003item 3: 3 \u2013 1 = 2 units\n\u2003\u2003item 4: 2 \u2013 0 = 2 units\n\u2003\u2003item 5: 5 \u2013 4 = 1 unit\n\nWhich has our total value:\n\u2003\u20034\u00d722 = 88,\n\u2003\u20035\u00d765 = 325,\n\u2003\u20032\u00d791 = 182,\n\u2003\u20032\u00d798 = 196,\n\u2003\u20031\u00d791 = 91,\nand indeed 88 + 325 + 182 + 196 + 91 = 882.\n\nBecause 882 > our outside offer (736) and the offer gives Player 1 a bundle worth 520 by our scale (which we expect is around or above their own disagreement level), we believe this is a beneficial counteroffer.\n\nThus, our action now is to propose a counteroffer with the bundle [0, 1, 1, 0, 4] (i.e. giving Player 1 zero units of item 1, one unit of item 2, one unit of item 3, zero units of item 4, and four units of item 5).\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 1, 0, 4]}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 0, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "I first note that the current offer gives me [1,1,0,1,2] so my bundle would be:\n\u2003\u2022 Item\u202f1: 1 unit \u2192 1\u00d713 = 13  \n\u2003\u2022 Item\u202f2: 1 unit \u2192 1\u00d754 = 54  \n\u2003\u2022 Item\u202f3: 0 units \u2192 0\u00d723 = 0  \n\u2003\u2022 Item\u202f4: 1 unit \u2192 1\u00d787 = 87  \n\u2003\u2022 Item\u202f5: 2 units \u2192 2\u00d769 = 138  \n\u2003Total = 13+54+0+87+138 = 292\n\nHowever, my outside offer would get me 509. (Also note that because we\u2019re in round\u202f1 the discount factor is 1.) So 292 is far lower than the \u201cwalk\u2010away\u201d fallback.\n\nMy idea in a counteroffer is to \u201cpull\u201d as much as possible of the items I value highly while giving Player\u202f1 just enough so that\u2014knowing nothing about his private values but expecting that his item\u2010values are uniformly distributed (with an average around 51)\u2014he gets at least roughly what his outside option would be (his expected fallback is on the order of 430\u2013440). I compare my private values with these \u201ctypical\u201d values. In my case the high\u2010value items are item\u202f4 (87 per unit) and item\u202f5 (69 per unit), so I want to keep those. In contrast, item\u202f1 (13 per unit) and item\u202f3 (23 per unit) are \u201ccheap\u201d for me compared to the likely average 51 that Player\u202f1 might realize. (Item\u202f2 (54) is almost \u201cfair\u201d but is only 1 unit available.) \n\nThe current offer by Player\u202f1 gave me only 292 worth. So I want to \u201cflip\u201d the division: by giving away nearly all units of the low\u2010value items while keeping all of the best ones. For example, if I propose giving Player\u202f1:\n\u2003\u2022 all 4 units of item\u202f1,\n\u2003\u2022 the only unit of item\u202f2,\n\u2003\u2022 all 3 units of item\u202f3,\n\u2003\u2022 nothing of item\u202f4 (so I keep all 5),\n\u2003\u2022 and just 1 unit of item\u202f5 (so I keep 3)\n  \nthen the counteroffer offer array is [4, 1, 3, 0, 1]. (This is valid because the available quantities are [4, 1, 3, 5, 4].)\n\nIf Player\u202f1 accepts this offer, the resulting allocation is:\n\u2003\u2022 For me: [4\u22124, 1\u22121, 3\u22123, 5\u22120, 4\u22121] = [0, 0, 0, 5, 3]  \n\u2003\u2003My value = 5\u00d787 + 3\u00d769 = 435 + 207 = 642.  \n\u2003\u2022 For Player\u202f1: the complementary bundle [4,1,3,0,1].  \n\u2003\u2003Assuming his (unknown) per\u2010unit values average about 51, his expected \u201craw\u201d value is roughly (4+1+3+1)\u00d751 = 9\u00d751 \u2248 459.\n\nEven discounted in the next round (discount factor 0.98) these would be about 642\u00d70.98 \u2248 629 for me and 459\u00d70.98 \u2248 450 for him\u2014both comfortably above our respective outside offers (I have 509 and his fallback is drawn from his full-items total, likely around the high 400\u2019s on average).\n\nSince the current offer gives me only 292, it makes sense to counteroffer with [4, 1, 3, 0, 1] so that I keep the high\u2010value items while offering Player\u202f1 a competitive (though minimal) package relative to his expected fallback.\n\nThus, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 1, 3, 0, 1]}",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

I will adjust the proposed division as follows: keep 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5:\n\n   - Value for 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147\n   - Value for 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291\n   - Value for 6 units of item 3 = 6 \u00d7 75 = 450\n   - Value for 4 units of item 4 = 4 \u00d7 48 = 192\n   - Value for 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285\n\n   Total value kept = 147 + 291 + 450 + 192 + 285 = 1365\n\n   This too is less than the outside offer, indicating that the proposed division should be further adjusted.\n\n3. Adjusting further:\n   - Let's aim for a retention of each item that just surpasses 1576: We can propose to keep 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5.\n\n   New calculation:\n   - Value for 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 49 = 196\n   - Value for 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291\n   - Value for 6 units of item 3 = 6 \u00d7 75 = 450\n   - Value for 4 units of item 4 = 4 \u00d7 48 = 192\n   - Value for 4 units of item 5 = 4 \u00d7 95 = 380\n\n   Total value kept = 196 + 291 + 450 + 192 + 380 = 1509, which doesn't meet our requirement. \nAfter considering various options, it appears that my earlier attempts failed to navigate correctly, and I must adjust to: \n   - keeping 5 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5.\n\n   New attempt: \n   - Value for 5 units of item 1 = 5 \u00d7 49 = 245\n   - Value for 4 units of item 2 = 4 \u00d7 97 = 388\n   - Value for 6 units of item 3 = 6 \u00d7 75 = 450\n   - Value for 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144\n   - Value for 4 units of item 5 = 4 \u00d7 95 = 380\n\n   Total value kept = 245 + 388 + 450 + 144 + 380 = 1607. \nHowever, I'm changing it to: 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, and 7 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5.\n\n   Calculation: \n   - Value for 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 49 = 196\n   - Value for 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291\n   - Value for 7 units of item 3 = 7 \u00d7 75 = 525\n   - Value for 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 48 = 96\n   - Value for 4 units of item 5 = 4 \u00d7 95 = 380\n\n   Total value kept = 196 + 291 + 525 + 96 + 380 =  1488, which still falls short. \n\nAfter recalibrating my analyses, I offer the following as part of my counteroffer:\n\nNew attempt: \n- Value for 5 units of item 1 = 5 \u00d7 49 = 245\n- Value for 4 units of item 2 = 4 \u00d7 97 = 388\n- Value for 6 units of item 3 = 6 \u00d7 75 = 450\n- Value for 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 48 = 96\n- Value for 4 units of item 5 = 4 \u00d7 95 = 380\n\nTotal value kept = 245 + 388 + 450 + 96 + 380 = 1559, indicating another fall-short of my needs.\n\nUpon recognizing possible mistakes, note the initial proper suggestion of: Keep 5 units of item 1 and 4 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5 while offering player 2 with the value units that would ensure my outside offer threshold.\n\nIn light of revelations that prior responses may not have computed correctly due to minor misunderstandings on allocations received: Final proposed optimal offer:\n\nReturning one last time to the original determination \n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 2, 1, 3, 1]}",

                    "response": "I want to explain my reasoning carefully. Here is my thought process:\n\n1. In this negotiation there are a total of 5, 4, 7, 5, and 4 units of items 1\u20135. (So if I denote the offer I give to Player 1 as a list [o1,o2,o3,o4,o5] then my allocation is [5\u2013o1, 4\u2013o2, 7\u2013o3, 5\u2013o4, 4\u2013o5].)\n\n2. My private per\u2010unit values are:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 1: 53  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 2: 52  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 3: 30  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 4: 87  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 5: 89.\n\n3. The current offer on the table (made by Player 1) is given \u201cto you\u201d as [4, 2, 1, 3, 1]. This means that if I ACCEPT I get exactly that many units of each item. (My share would then be the numbers shown by the opponent; while Player 1 would get the remainder.) Calculating my total value from that offer:\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 4\u00d753 = 212\n\u2003\u2003Item 2: 2\u00d752 = 104\n\u2003\u2003Item 3: 1\u00d730 = 30\n\u2003\u2003Item 4: 3\u00d787 = 261\n\u2003\u2003Item 5: 1\u00d789 = 89\n\u2003\u2003Total = 212 + 104 + 30 + 261 + 89 = 696.\n\u2003\u2003Since my outside (disagreement) offer is 718 (and no discount applies at round 1), 696 is less than what I can secure by walking.\n\n4. As I am Player 2, I want a deal that yields me at least 718 in value. I can \u201cflip\u201d the division by proposing a counteroffer that gives Player 1 exactly what the current offer \u201cto me\u201d would have been\u2014in effect, I would get the complementary allocation. To check this idea we note:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 If I propose \u201cCOUNTEROFFER\u201d with offer [4,2,1,3,1] (which means I offer that many units to Player 1), then my allocation becomes:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 1: 5 \u2013 4 = 1 unit  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 2: 4 \u2013 2 = 2 units  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 3: 7 \u2013 1 = 6 units  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 4: 5 \u2013 3 = 2 units  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 5: 4 \u2013 1 = 3 units.\n\u2003\u2003Calculating my utility then:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003item 1: 1\u00d753 = 53  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003item 2: 2\u00d752 = 104  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003item 3: 6\u00d730 = 180  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003item 4: 2\u00d787 = 174  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003item 5: 3\u00d789 = 267  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Total = 53 + 104 + 180 + 174 + 267 = 778.\n\u2003\u2003This gives me 778, which is well above my disagreement value of 718.\n\n5. (Note also that by \u201cflipping\u201d we are taking advantage of our knowledge of our own values. Items in which I have relatively high marginal values (especially items 4 and 5) I want to keep for myself. By proposing this counteroffer I shift the difference in allocation to my favor relative to what I would get by simply accepting the current offer.)\n\n6. Even though Player 1\u2019s true per\u2010unit values are private and they might prefer their originally intended division, from my perspective it is worthwhile to demand this improved split since my own share increases from 696 (if I simply accept) to 778. It meets my reservation value and gives me a clear improvement in my outcome.\n\nThus, my action is to propose the counteroffer in which I offer Player 1 [4,2,1,3,1]. \n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4,2,1,3,1]}",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 4, 6, 4, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    49 x 5 + 97 x 4 + 75 x 6 + 48 x 4 + 95 x 3\n    which is 1560 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1576. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [4, 2, 1, 3, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [4, 2, 1, 3, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [4, 2, 1, 3, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Since we are currently in round 2, if we conclude this round the value would be adjusted by multiplying by 0.98.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n1. **Value of the Current Offer** ([4, 2, 1, 3, 1] for me):\n   - Value from 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 49 = 196\n   - Value from 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 97 = 194\n   - Value from 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 75 = 75\n   - Value from 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144\n   - Value from 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 95 = 95\n   - Total value = 196 + 194 + 75 + 144 + 95 = 704\n\n   Adjusted for the discount factor for round 2 (0.98^1 = 0.98):\n   - Adjusted value = 704 \u00d7 0.98 = 689.92\n\n2. **Comparison with Outside Offer**:\n   - The adjusted current offer value of 689.92 is significantly less than my outside offer value of 1576.\n\n3. **Assess Potential Counteroffers**:\n   - To propose a viable counteroffer, the value must exceed my outside offer value of 1576.\n   - Due to the limited distribution of item units and my high outside offer, crafting a worthwhile counteroffer that matches or exceeds 1576 is challenging without knowing Player 2's valuation.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nGiven the above analysis:\n\n1. **Accepting the Current Offer**: The adjusted value of the current offer (689.92) is significantly less than my outside offer (1576), so this is not a good option.\n2. **Walking Away**: Securing my outside offer value of 1576 is favorable compared to the current offer.\n3. **Declining to Counteroffer**: Due to the high outside offer value and the constraints of item distribution, no reasonable counteroffer can secure a value higher than 1576.\n\nThus, the best course of action, under these conditions, is to walk away and take the secure option of my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 58. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 582 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 3, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    23 x 0 + 11 x 0 + 54 x 0 + 19 x 3 + 87 x 0\n    which is 57 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 58. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To decide on my action, I'll walk through the steps as outlined:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **My outside offer value:** 58\n- **Values of the items involved:**\n  - Item 1: 23 per unit\n  - Item 2: 11 per unit\n  - Item 3: 54 per unit\n  - Item 4: 19 per unit\n  - Item 5: 87 per unit\n- **Total pool of items:**\n  - Item 1: 1 unit\n  - Item 2: 5 units\n  - Item 3: 6 units\n  - Item 4: 3 units\n  - Item 5: 7 units\n\nThe discount factor (\\(\\gamma = 0.98\\)) suggests that the value of offers decreases with each round. Since we are in round 1, this currently doesn't affect the decision, but it\u2019s a factor to consider if negotiation goes past round 1.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\nSince there is no current offer on the table, I will consider potential counteroffers. My goal is to propose a division where my value exceeds my outside offer value of 58.\n\nTo prevent mistakes, I need to ensure my counteroffer provides a value greater than 58 and doesn't fall into any of the highlighted mistakes.\n\n### Calculation Example to Structure a Counteroffer\n\nI will attempt a potential fair distribution strategy that gives me a high value while making some reasonable split:\n\n**Proposal: Split with emphasis on my higher value items**\n\n- **Item 1:** Offer 0 units; I keep 1 unit (my value: \\(1 \\times 23 = 23\\))\n- **Item 2:** Offer 3 units; I keep 2 units (my value: \\(2 \\times 11 = 22\\))\n- **Item 3:** Offer 3 units; I keep 3 units (my value: \\(3 \\times 54 = 162\\))\n- **Item 4:** Offer 1 unit; I keep 2 units (my value: \\(2 \\times 19 = 38\\))\n- **Item 5:** Offer 3 units; I keep 4 units (my value: \\(4 \\times 87 = 348\\))\n\n**Total Value Calculation:**\n\n\\[ 23 + 22 + 162 + 38 + 348 = 593 \\]\n\nSince the calculated total value (593) exceeds my outside offer (58), it is an acceptable counteroffer.\n\n### Decision\n\nI will propose this counteroffer as it maximizes my value without risking any of the negotiation mistakes.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 3, 1, 3]}",

                    "response": "Step 1. Evaluate the current offer:\n\u2022 The offer on the table gives you [0, 3, 3, 1, 3]. That means you would receive:\n\u2003\u2013 Item 1: 0 units \u2192 0\u00d761 = 0\n\u2003\u2013 Item 2: 3 units \u2192 3\u00d766 = 198\n\u2003\u2013 Item 3: 3 units \u2192 3\u00d714 = 42\n\u2003\u2013 Item 4: 1 unit \u2192 1\u00d780 = 80\n\u2003\u2013 Item 5: 3 units \u2192 3\u00d741 = 123\n\u2022 Total value if you ACCEPT = 0+198+42+80+123 = 443.\n\u2022 Since you have an outside offer of 842 (and there is no discount in round 1 as \u03b3^(0)=1) this deal is far below your fallback.\n\nStep 2. Considering negotiation:\n\u2022 You are Player 2. When you make a counteroffer you specify what you would \u201cgive\u201d to Player 1 \u2013 the remaining units go to you.\n\u2022 Your total item values (if you got everything) would sum to 1002. To be at least as good as your outside offer, you need to ensure your share is worth at least 842.\n\u2022 That means you can afford to concede at most 1002 \u2013 842 = 160 in terms of your own valuations.\n\nStep 3. Designing a counteroffer:\n\u2022 Let your counteroffer be represented as x = [x\u2081, x\u2082, x\u2083, x\u2084, x\u2085] where these are the units given to Player 1; you keep (total \u2013 x).\n\u2022 Your value from your share = 61*(1 \u2013 x\u2081) + 66*(5 \u2013 x\u2082) + 14*(6 \u2013 x\u2083) + 80*(3 \u2013 x\u2084) + 41*(7 \u2013 x\u2085) must be \u2265842.\n\u2022 In order to \u201cconcede\u201d as little as possible from your perspective (i.e. give up as little value as possible), you want to offer primarily items that you value less.\n\u2022 Among the items, item 3 is the least valued by you (14 per unit). So it makes sense to offer as many of item 3 as possible if needed.\n\u2022 One proposal: Offer all 6 units of item 3 (concession = 6\u00d714 = 84 in your value) and also 1 unit of item 2 (costing 66) for a total concession of 84 + 66 = 150. This leaves you a value of 1002 \u2013 150 = 852, which is safely above your outside offer of 842.\n\u2022 Let\u2019s check the numbers:\n\u2003\u2013 For item 1, concede 0 (you keep 1 unit \u2192 1\u00d761 = 61).\n\u2003\u2013 For item 2, concede 1 (you keep 4 units \u2192 4\u00d766 = 264).\n\u2003\u2013 For item 3, concede 6 (you keep 0 units \u2192 0\u00d714 = 0).\n\u2003\u2013 For item 4, concede 0 (you keep all 3 units \u2192 3\u00d780 = 240).\n\u2003\u2013 For item 5, concede 0 (you keep all 7 units \u2192 7\u00d741 = 287).\n\u2003\u2022 Your total value becomes: 61 + 264 + 0 + 240 + 287 = 852.\n\u2022 These concessions are within your margin, and by giving P1 items (especially the ones you value low) you try to provide them with enough appeal to prefer the deal over their own outside option. (Of course, you do not know P1\u2019s valuation exactly; however, by conceding items that are \u201ccheap\u201d for you, you minimize your cost while potentially giving them something valuable.)\n\nStep 4. Conclusion:\nSince the current offer gives you too little (443 vs. 842 if you walk), you should not ACCEPT. Instead, you issue a counteroffer giving Player 1 [0, 1, 6, 0, 0]. This is a valid offer (does not exceed available quantities) and, if P1 accepts, you secure a deal with payoff 852 (>842) without any discount since you\u2019re still in Round 1.\n\nThus, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 6, 0, 0]}",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 1176. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1176. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 927 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 7, 2, 5, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    71 x 2 + 83 x 7 + 96 x 2 + 18 x 5 + 41 x 4\n    which is 1169 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1176. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To determine the best course of action, let's follow the guided steps:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - **Outside offer value:** My outside offer is 1176.\n   - **Values of the items involved:**\n     - Item 1: 71 per unit\n     - Item 2: 83 per unit\n     - Item 3: 96 per unit\n     - Item 4: 18 per unit\n     - Item 5: 41 per unit\n   - **Total pool of items:**\n     - 3 units of item 1\n     - 7 units of item 2\n     - 2 units of item 3\n     - 5 units of item 4\n     - 4 units of item 5\n\n   - **Discount factor:** The discount factor is 0.98. It reduces the value of an outcome if it takes more rounds to reach agreement, affecting the total value calculation based on how many rounds are negotiated.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer value:** There is no current offer to evaluate.\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** I will calculate potential offers to see if any would be preferable to my outside offer.\n\n     Let's consider the full value of the items if I keep them all:\n     - \\((3 \\times 71) + (7 \\times 83) + (2 \\times 96) + (5 \\times 18) + (4 \\times 41) = 213 + 581 + 192 + 90 + 164 = 1240\\)\n\n   To maximize my value, I want my kept share's value to be greater than my outside offer of 1176. I need to leave Player 2 with a reasonable amount to ensure they'll consider accepting.\n\n   Let's start with an offer, retain the most valuable items for myself, and give Player 2 enough to consider accepting:\n\n   If I offer:\n   - [1, 0, 0, 5, 2] to Player 2, keeping [2, 7, 2, 0, 2] for myself.\n\n   My value for this offer:\n   - Keep item 1: \\(2 \\times 71 = 142\\)\n   - Keep item 2: \\(7 \\times 83 = 581\\)\n   - Keep item 3: \\(2 \\times 96 = 192\\)\n   - Keep item 4: \\(0 \\times 18 = 0\\)\n   - Keep item 5: \\(2 \\times 41 = 82\\)\n   - Total = \\(142 + 581 + 192 + 82 = 997\\)\n\n   Value of 997 is still less than my outside offer. Let's try a different configuration.\n\n   If I offer:\n   - [0, 1, 0, 4, 2] to Player 2, keeping [3, 6, 2, 1, 2] for myself.\n\n   My value for this offer:\n   - Keep item 1: \\(3 \\times 71 = 213\\) \n   - Keep item 2: \\(6 \\times 83 = 498\\) \n   - Keep item 3: \\(2 \\times 96 = 192\\) \n   - Keep item 4: \\(1 \\times 18 = 18\\)\n   - Keep item 5: \\(2 \\times 41 = 82\\) \n   - Total = \\(213 + 498 + 192 + 18 + 82 = 1003\\)\n\n   Again, this is less than my outside offer. Let's refine further.\n\n   If I offer:\n   - [0, 2, 0, 4, 3] to Player 2, keeping [3, 5, 2, 1, 1] for myself.\n\n   My value for this offer:\n   - Keep item 1: \\(3 \\times 71 = 213\\) \n   - Keep item 2: \\(5 \\times 83 = 415\\) \n   - Keep item 3: \\(2 \\times 96 = 192\\) \n   - Keep item 4: \\(1 \\times 18 = 18\\) \n   - Keep item 5: \\(1 \\times 41 = 41\\) \n   - Total = \\(213 + 415 + 192 + 18 + 41 = 879\\)\n   \n   These steps indicate all trials are below the benchmark of 1176, but trying to get closer to a realistic counteroffer:\n\n   Finally, offer:\n   - [0, 3, 1, 3, 2] to Player 2, keeping [3, 4, 1, 2, 2] for myself.\n\n   My value for this offer:\n   - Keep item 1: \\(3 \\times 71 = 213\\)\n   - Keep item 2: \\(4 \\times 83 = 332\\)\n   - Keep item 3: \\(1 \\times 96 = 96\\)\n   - Keep item 4: \\(2 \\times 18 = 36\\)\n   - Keep item 5: \\(2 \\times 41 = 82\\)\n   - Total = \\(213 + 332 + 96 + 36 + 82 = 759\\)\n\n   Finally, bolstering this to my outside offer by optimizing further is fruitless given constraints. Ultimately more of my value will be required heavily to match the 1176 cutoff. Let's be strategic and concede at a revised offer:\n\n  As [3, 3, 1, 2, 2] allows a viable pitch with room, yielding 908 still, not surpassing my outside offer \u2014 and recalibrating in pursuit yields same after thematic upper limits on own permissible keep. I will:\n\n3) **Decision Making:**\n\nI will choose to walk away from a better strategy alternative, knowing that any other trial gives less than 1176.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

The current offer (Player\u00a01\u2019s offer of [2,1,1,1,2] to me) would give me 383, which is far too little. \nIf I instead propose to give Player\u00a01 the offer [2,1,2,2,2], then:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Player\u00a01 would receive: 2 in item1, 1 in item2, 2 in item3, 2 in item4, and 2 in item5.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 I would keep the rest: [5\u20132, 3\u20131, 4\u20132, 4\u20132, 4\u20132] = [3,2,2,2,2].\n\nMy value for my share would be:\n\u2003\u20033\u00d749 + 2\u00d724 + 2\u00d799 + 2\u00d756 + 2\u00d753\n\u2003\u2003\u2003= 147 + 48 + 198 + 112 + 106\n\u2003\u2003\u2003= 611.\nThis 611 is safely above my outside option of 528, and from my perspective Player\u00a01\u2019s package would be worth \n\u2003\u20032\u00d749 + 1\u00d724 + 2\u00d799 + 2\u00d756 + 2\u00d753 = 98 + 24 + 198 + 112 + 106 = 538,\nwhich, although a bit lower than my share, is not extremely unreasonable given that I have the second\u2010move advantage here.\n\nThus, since accepting the current offer is worse than my outside option and I believe I can do better by making a counteroffer that improves my position while still offering Player\u00a01 something close to a 50\u201350 split (from my perspective), I will counteroffer with [2,1,2,2,2].\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2,1,2,2,2]}",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 3, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

(My own value for item 1 is quite low, only 2, so I can afford to give Player 1 an extra unit there to compensate.) \n\nIn the current offer, Player 1 gets:\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 5 \u2013 3 = 2 units,\n\u2003\u2003Item 2: 6 \u2013 3 = 3 units,\n\u2003\u2003Item 3: 4 \u2013 3 = 1 unit,\n\u2003\u2003Item 4: 8 \u2013 4 = 4 units,\n\u2003\u2003Item 5: 3 \u2013 2 = 1 unit.\nIf I instead propose to give Player 1 one extra unit of item 1 and take that extra unit of item 3, the proposed allocation for Player 1 becomes:\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 3 units,\n\u2003\u2003Item 2: 3 units,\n\u2003\u2003Item 3: 0 units,\n\u2003\u2003Item 4: 4 units,\n\u2003\u2003Item 5: 1 unit.\nThen my allocation would be:\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 5\u20133 = 2 units (2\u00d72 = 4),\n\u2003\u2003Item 2: 6\u20133 = 3 units (3\u00d715 = 45),\n\u2003\u2003Item 3: 4\u20130 = 4 units (4\u00d779 = 316),\n\u2003\u2003Item 4: 8\u20134 = 4 units (4\u00d759 = 236),\n\u2003\u2003Item 5: 3\u20131 = 2 units (2\u00d742 = 84).\nSumming these gives me 4 + 45 + 316 + 236 + 84 = 685, an improvement over 608.\n\nFrom Player 1\u2019s perspective (though I don\u2019t know their exact values) his share goes from \n\u2003\u2003[2, 3, 1, 4, 1] in the current offer (with an estimated expected value, if we assume an average of about 51 per unit, roughly 561) \nto the new share \n\u2003\u2003[3, 3, 0, 4, 1].\nHere he gains one extra unit of item 1 (worth roughly 51 compared to the loss of 1 unit of item 3 worth roughly 51), making him roughly indifferent to his previous position. Avoiding delay (and discounting), he might well accept an offer that leaves him nearly as well off.\n\nThus, I will make the following counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 3, 0, 4, 1]}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 2, 5, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    77 x 0 + 87 x 2 + 15 x 2 + 22 x 5 + 97 x 1\n    which is 411 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 412. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 3, 3, 4, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 3, 0, 4, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 3, 0, 4, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

I focus on items where my values are high (such as items 2, 3, and 5) so that by keeping those I can ensure I exceed 383 in total value.\n\nOne acceptable approach is to try keeping all of items 2 and 3 (which I value highly) and most of item 5. To illustrate:\n\u2003\u2022 If I receive all of item\u202f2 (2 units) and item\u202f3 (2 units) then I get\n\u2003\u20032\u00d797 + 2\u00d788 = 194 + 176 = 370.\nThat is very near 383, so I add 1 unit of item\u202f5 (value 57) to push me over:\n\u2003\u2003Total = 370 + 57 = 427.\nThis leaves the remainder\u2014i.e. all of item\u202f1 (4 units), all of item\u202f4 (5 units), and the remaining 1 unit of item\u202f5\u2014to Player\u202f1.\n\nThus my counteroffer (remember, as Player\u202f2 the offer I make is what I give Player\u202f1) is to propose giving Player\u202f1:\n\u2003Item 1: 4 units,\n\u2003Item 2: 0 units,\n\u2003Item 3: 0 units,\n\u2003Item 4: 5 units,\n\u2003Item 5: 1 unit.\nThis division gives me the remainder:\n\u2003Item 1: 0,\n\u2003Item 2: 2,\n\u2003Item 3: 2,\n\u2003Item 4: 0,\n\u2003Item 5: 1,\nand a value of 2\u00d797 + 2\u00d788 + 1\u00d757 = 194 + 176 + 57 = 427, which is comfortably above my outside offer of 383 and ensures that I am better off with the deal than by walking away.\n\nTherefore, my action is to make this counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 0, 0, 5, 1]}",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 1, 2, 4, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    55 x 3 + 43 x 1 + 37 x 2 + 77 x 4 + 29 x 2\n    which is 648 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 650. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "My analysis is as follows:\n\nMy total potential value is 879. The current offer on the table would give me: \n\u2022 Item 1: 1 unit \u2192 93 pts  \n\u2022 Item 2: 1 unit \u2192 65 pts  \n\u2022 Item 3: 4 units \u2192 32 pts  \n\u2022 Item 4: 1 unit \u2192 64 pts  \n\u2022 Item 5: 3 units \u2192 138 pts  \nAdding up to 93 + 65 + 32 + 64 + 138 = 392, which is far below my outside option of 818. Since I get no discount at round 1 (\u03b3^0 = 1), I must do better than my outside offer.\n\nA natural strategy is to \u201cclaim\u201d almost all items so that my share\u2019s value is at least 818 (so I do better than walking away) while giving Player 1 a nonzero share that might make him accept the deal. My total is 879, so if I can engineer a deal in which I receive items totaling roughly 818 or more (in my own valuations), I will be better off. In other words, I need to \u201cgive away\u201d items worth about 879 \u2013 818 = 61 in my own assessment.\n\nBecause the unit values are large and vary by item and I can\u2019t divide items partly, exactly achieving 61 isn\u2019t possible. I looked for a combination that yields a \u201closs\u201d of around 61:\n\u2022 Removing one unit of an item with value 65 would drop my total too far (giving 879 \u2013 65 = 814, which is below my outside offer), so that\u2019s not acceptable.\n\u2022 An alternative is to give away one unit of item 3 (value 8) and one unit of item 5 (value 46), for a total \u201closs\u201d of 8 + 46 = 54. That leaves me with 879 \u2013 54 = 825, which is just above my outside option.\n\u2022 Checking feasibility: giving away one unit of item 3 (total available 6) and one unit of item 5 (total available 5) is valid.\n\nThus, if I give Player 1 [0, 0, 1, 0, 1] (meaning I keep the rest), my allocation becomes:\n\u2022 Item 1: 3 \u2013 0 = 3 units \u2192 3 \u00d7 93 = 279  \n\u2022 Item 2: 2 \u2013 0 = 2 units \u2192 2 \u00d7 65 = 130  \n\u2022 Item 3: 6 \u2013 1 = 5 units \u2192 5 \u00d7 8 = 40  \n\u2022 Item 4: 3 \u2013 0 = 3 units \u2192 3 \u00d7 64 = 192  \n\u2022 Item 5: 5 \u2013 1 = 4 units \u2192 4 \u00d7 46 = 184  \nTotal value = 279 + 130 + 40 + 192 + 184 = 825\n\nThis is above my outside offer of 818 while still offering Player 1 something (which may help persuade Player 1 to settle now rather than risk waiting or getting his own outside offer later). \n\nTherefore, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 0, 1]}",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 1, 1, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    67 x 2 + 61 x 1 + 19 x 1 + 75 x 0 + 57 x 0\n    which is 214 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 215. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 4, 1, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 1, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 1, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

This affects values in future rounds, reducing the effective value slightly each round, but since it's round 2, we only apply 0.98 to the value once.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer on the table (what I'm getting): [0, 0, 1, 0, 1]\n     - Value = 0x67 + 0x61 + 1x19 + 0x75 + 1x57 = 19 + 57 = 76\n     - Adjusted value for current round (round 2, gamma = 0.98): 76 * 0.98 = 74.48\n   - My outside offer value is 215, which is greater than 74.48.\n   - Therefore, the current offer is worse for me than my outside offer.\n\n   - My previous offer was [1, 1, 4, 1, 3], and we calculate my values if I make or counter a similar offer.\n   \n   - Consider a potential counteroffer.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 6, 5, 2, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    86 x 1 + 85 x 6 + 19 x 5 + 33 x 2 + 16 x 3\n    which is 805 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 806. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

So, I need to slightly adjust to get more value:\n\nIf I keep more of item 2 and let go of item 3 or item 4, which are less valuable to me:\n\n- Trying to keep all of item 2:\n  - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 39 = 78\n  - 8 units of item 2 = 8 \u00d7 79 = 632\n  - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 34 = 34\n  - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 7 = 14\n  - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 21 = 21\n- **Total value to me once more:** 78 + 632 + 34 + 14 + 21 = 779\n\nTrying another combination by keeping all item 2 and distributing lesser-valued items:\n\n- Keep 8 units of item 2 and give away excess of the others:\n  - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 39 = 78\n  - 8 units of item 2 = 8 \u00d7 79 = 632\n  - 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 34 = 0\n  - 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 7 = 0\n  - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 21 = 21\n- **Total value to me:** 78 + 632 + 0 + 0 + 21 = 731\n\nI need to try again. \n\nBy trying a more balanced split:\n- Keep 8 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 3, let go of less valuable:\n  - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 39 = 39\n  - 8 units of item 2 = 8 \u00d7 79 = 632\n  - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 34 = 68\n  - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 7 = 7\n  - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 21 = 0\n- **Total value to me:** 39 + 632 + 68 + 7 + 0 = 746\n\nAgain, this is not optimal. Let me adjust the offer yet again:\n\nI must find a distribution for higher valuable items that at least provides a value higher than 815, so I can choose to index one value further or rather, divide the resources without player's bearing of any item types lower substantial.\n\nFinally, let's see if matching near-to or above the outside offer in final attempt:\n\n- Keep 2 units of item 1, 8 units of item 2, distribute lesser valued equally as:\n  (for when to achieve any complete number of cores expectantly)\n  - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 39 = 78\n  - 8 units of item 2 = 8 \u00d7 79 = 632\n  - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 34 = 68\n  - 1 units of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 7 = 7\n  - 1 units of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 21 = 21\n  - Total value: 78 + 632 + 68 + 7 + 21 = 806.\n\nIf I decide to counteroffer lowering only minor stakes as adjusted to 806 (meaning lesser than the outside offer value) hence, I must chose wherewith: offer lesser profitable or more specific layout. \nFor instance, to counteroffer [0, 0, 0, 4, 0] keeping priority here prioritized not entirely via moderate.\n\nFinally tested maximal but: if unable to counter suitable way:\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision Based on the Analysis\nSince my initial offers do not reach the outside offer amidst that considering other factors and assured acceptance tied to decision of maximizing between via item reduced.\n\nThe reserve, or valuable method chosen based on the known outcome vs attempt of real difference yet reasonably now leads or follows towards choosing allow first player to right extent when quartered accountable as range yet may hinge upon specific living considering other walks.\n\nThus, deciding whether to accept since proper strategic result of round intent as withheld dealing with active responsibility generally determines either by used below path:\n\nGiven rounding outright achieves plus current value, no actions taken lead my own lateral if constrained still despite prior offer conducts exchanges but irreversibility premise depending value transacts toward outcome.\n\nTherefore, going by:\n- Action to **COUNTEROFFER**, initial assumption to tentative scenario prospective efficient achieving offer like stable exchange possible present aspect: like [0, 0, 0, 4, 0] offer as firstly therewith distributed where equally preferred accepting or finalizing nature properly engages otherwise part or properly application necessary leading maybe some tangible smaller path.\n\nIf explicit allowance or otherwise translates into full offer [0, 0, 0, 4, 0] still tentative viable offer strategic first:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 4, 0]} would assignently pre-decided alternate act given bring hopefully differently optimized way could translate to slightly among broader being underserved while mistrusting potentially across counter option dubiously unfavorable likely willing; possibly resolved satisfactorily leading realistic suggested through one reconsideration.",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 7, 1, 4, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    24 x 0 + 76 x 7 + 10 x 1 + 13 x 4 + 42 x 0\n    which is 594 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 595. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To decide on the initial offer, let's go through the questions step by step:\n\n1. **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value: 595.\n   - My values for the items:\n     - Item 1: 24\n     - Item 2: 76\n     - Item 3: 10\n     - Item 4: 13\n     - Item 5: 42\n   - Total pool of items:\n     - 3 units of item 1\n     - 7 units of item 2\n     - 2 units of item 3\n     - 5 units of item 4\n     - 3 units of item 5\n   - Discount factor influence: The discount factor of 0.98 implies that if a deal is reached in subsequent rounds, the value of the outcome will be slightly lower. Therefore, securing a favorable deal earlier can be advantageous.\n\n2. **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - There is no current offer to evaluate.\n   - For potential counteroffers, I need a combination of items that provides a total value greater than my outside offer of 595.\n\n   Let's evaluate a sample counteroffer using potential divisions:\n   - If I keep 0 of item 1 and give all 3 to Player 2, I keep 0 value of item 1.\n   - If I keep 0 of item 5 and give all 3 to Player 2, I keep 0 value of item 5.\n   - For item 2, if I keep 6 units and give 1 to Player 2, I get 6 \u00d7 76 = 456.\n   - For item 3, if I keep 1 unit and give 1 to Player 2, I get 1 \u00d7 10 = 10.\n   - For item 4, if I keep 4 units and give 1 to Player 2, I get 4 \u00d7 13 = 52.\n   \n   Total value for me: 0 + 456 + 10 + 52 + 0 = 518\n   \n   This is still below my outside offer, therefore it's not a suitable proposal. Let's try different configurations.\n\n   - Keep 0 of item 1 (give 3), 5 of item 2 (give 2), 1 of item 3 (give 1), 5 of item 4 (give 0), and 1 of item 5 (give 2):\n     - Item 1: 0 \u00d7 24 = 0\n     - Item 2: 5 \u00d7 76 = 380\n     - Item 3: 1 \u00d7 10 = 10\n     - Item 4: 5 \u00d7 13 = 65\n     - Item 5: 1 \u00d7 42 = 42\n\n   Total value for me: 0 + 380 + 10 + 65 + 42 = 497\n   \n   This is still below my outside offer. \n   \n   - Let's try another scenario where I give away more of the less valued items but keep more of the highly valued ones.\n\n   - Keep 0 of item 1 (give 3), 4 of item 2 (give 3), 1 of item 3 (give 1), 5 of item 4 (give 0), and 2 of item 5 (give 1):\n     - Item 1: 0 \u00d7 24 = 0\n     - Item 2: 4 \u00d7 76 = 304\n     - Item 3: 1 \u00d7 10 = 10\n     - Item 4: 5 \u00d7 13 = 65\n     - Item 5: 2 \u00d7 42 = 84\n\n   Total value for me: 0 + 304 + 10 + 65 + 84 = 463\n   \n   This is still below my outside offer. Let's try to explore breathing room by giving more of item 2.\n\n   - Keep 2 of item 1 (give 1), 5 of item 2 (give 2), 1 of item 3 (give 1), 1 of item 4 (give 4), and 1 of item 5 (give 2):\n     - Item 1: 2 \u00d7 24 = 48\n     - Item 2: 5 \u00d7 76 = 380\n     - Item 3: 1 \u00d7 10 = 10\n     - Item 4: 1 \u00d7 13 = 13\n     - Item 5: 1 \u00d7 42 = 42\n\n   Total value for me: 48 + 380 + 10 + 13 + 42 = 493\n   \n   This configuration results in a total value of 493, which is still below my outside offer.\n\n   After several iterations, it's clear that calculating manually might not arrive at a number greater than or equal to 595 without further automated processes.\n\n3. **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - Given no configuration has exceeded the outside offer value, and since we need an advantageous offer, let's test keeping a maximal of item 2 and iterate:\n\n   - Offer to keep all items from item 2: \n     - Keep 3 of item 1 (give 0), 7 of item 2 (give 0), 0 of item 3 (give 2), 0 of item 4 (give 5), and 0 of item 5 (give 3):\n       - Item 1: 3 \u00d7 24 = 72\n       - Item 2: 7 \u00d7 76 = 532\n       - Item 3: 0 \u00d7 10 = 0\n       - Item 4: 0 \u00d7 13 = 0\n       - Item 5: 0 \u00d7 42 = 0\n\n     Total value for me: 72 + 532 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 604\n   \n   This is higher than my outside offer of 595.\n\nWith this approach, a reasonable initial offer is found that exceeds my outside offer. Therefore, the logical move is to offer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 2, 5, 3]}",

Notice that in his offer Player\u202f1 gets all of the units of items\u202f1 and 2 (i.e. 3 of item\u202f1 and 7 of item\u202f2), while I get everything from items\u202f3,4,5.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 595. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 495 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 7, 1, 4, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    24 x 0 + 76 x 7 + 10 x 1 + 13 x 4 + 42 x 0\n    which is 594 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 595. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 2, 5, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 6, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 6, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?
